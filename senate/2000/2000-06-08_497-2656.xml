These amendments are currently before the Senate as part of the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. While it appears that provisions unrelated to those contained in this bill will delay its passage, it is important that both the AN and maritime amendments are allowed to proceed in a timely fashion. The amendments will enable the wind-up of AN to be finalised by 30 June 2000 and for Australia to meet its commitments under the 1998 Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.</para><para>As a consequence of the unrelated difficulties the AN and Maritime amendments are now being re-introduced as part of the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I note that the Opposition and Democrats previously indicated that they would support these amendments when they were considered in the Committee stage as part of the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999.</para><para>The sale of the three operating businesses of AN in 1997 constituted a significant milestone in the Government's rail reform agenda. Improving the performance of Australia's railways will contribute to the competitiveness of the nation's businesses and the entire economy. Accordingly, the Government places a high priority on achieving reform in this important area.</para><para>The sound performance of the former AN businesses in private ownership clearly supports the Government's view that the Commonwealth should not be involved in the operation of railway businesses. The passenger operator has extended the historic Ghan services between Adelaide and Alice Springs to Melbourne and Sydney as part of a strategy to target important international tourist markets. The two freight businesses have achieved profitability for the first time in many years and have attracted significant new business. These results have only been achievable through the provision of improved service to customers.  </para><para>The positive performance by these companies is of particular benefit to South Australia and Tasmania. As rail freight becomes a viable alternative, through competitive prices and service quality, it will facilitate and enhance the performance of other businesses. Furthermore, the impressive results achieved will contribute to the security of long term employment in the rail industry.</para><para>The sale of the AN businesses was facilitated by the Australian National Railways Commission Sale Act 1997 (the Sale Act), which commenced on 30 June 1997. Following sale, AN was reduced to a non-operating entity charged with managing any residual functions, including the realisation of remaining assets and liabilities, and resolving outstanding litigation and disputes prior to abolition.</para><para>Proclamation of the remaining provisions of the Sale Act will enable the residual AN entity to be abolished as well as the repeal or amendment of a number of Acts relating to the previous operations of AN. All conditions specified in the Sale Act which are to be met prior to Proclamation have been satisfied. It is now important to abolish the residual entity to remove the administrative burden and cost currently being borne by the Commonwealth.</para><para>Two issues of a technical nature have been identified which need to be addressed before the remaining provisions of the Sale Act can be Proclaimed. The amendments being proposed will correct an inaccurate citing of the Port Augusta to Whyalla Railway Act 1970. It will also enable the preservation of a technically robust process for registration of title for land already legally transferred from AN to the Australian Rail Track Corporation. </para><para>While the proposed amendment is of a technical nature, it is essential to enable the wind up of AN therefore reducing the ongoing administrative costs to the Commonwealth.</para><para>The commencement provision of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 is being amended to overcome a technical difficulty that prevents a Proclamation being made for the commencement of amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. Those amendments relate to the discharge of sewage and disposal of garbage from ships in the Antarctic area.</para><para>Currently, the commencement provision provides that the relevant provisions commence on a date to be fixed by Proclamation, being the day on which the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty enters into force. The Protocol entered into force on 14 January 1998. Insufficient notice of the entering into force of the Protocol was provided to enable a Proclamation to be made by that date. The amendment removes references to the Protocol. It is anticipated that Proclamation will be made soon after this bill receives Royal Assent.</para><para>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUN-T-ABILITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000 </para><para>This Bill, a Bill to amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, provides for a supplement to annual and special appropriations on account of amounts of GST paid by Commonwealth entities, as part of consideration for a taxable supply or on creditable importations, which are recoverable through the input tax credit mechanism (recoverable GST).</para><para>The need for this technical amendment results from the way in which GST will impact on the Commonwealth's transactions, and the way in which annual and special appropriations are made.</para><para>The Commonwealth and Commonwealth entities will be liable to pay GST in respect of taxable supplies and taxable importations, so that they will be treated in much the same way as other GST taxpayers. They will not be exempted from GST passed onto them by their suppliers. </para><para>The accepted Australian guidance concerning the accounting treatment of GST in respect of expenses and assets is set out in Urgent Issues Group Abstract 31, issued by the Australian Accounting and Research Foundation in January 2000. Consistent with this guidance, annual and special appropriations will be made on a GST exclusive basis. Accordingly, amounts in the annual Appropriation Bills represent the net amount, or cost to the Budget, that Parliament is asked to allocate for particular purposes. </para><para>It is a Constitutional requirement that all payments by the Commonwealth be made under appropriation made by law. </para><para>This Bill proposes an amendment to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to provide for additional appropriation to supplement annual and special appropriations, equal to any recoverable GST payable by Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure that there will always be sufficient appropriation to cover the full amount of a payment, where the GST exclusive amount of the payment has been made by way of annual or special appropriation.</para><para>Parliamentary control over, and scrutiny of, expenditure will not be diminished as a result of the additional appropriation. </para><para>The additional appropriation will not have any Budgetary impact, as the part of the payment it represents will be recovered by the Commonwealth agency or department as an input tax credit.</para><para>I commend the Bill.</para><para>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL( NO. 2) 2000</para><para>This bill proposes the repeal of Section 130 of the <inline font-style="italic">Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967</inline>.<inline font-style="italic"></inline> Section 130 was introduced in 1985 to allow the payment of $117.1 million in 1984/85 dollars to Western Australia through an annual schedule of payments. This agreement was entered into after the Western Australian government's gas utility sought to renegotiate domestic gas âtake or payâ contracts with the North West Shelf joint venture participants. </para><para>The schedule of annual payments was planned to run from 1985-86 to 2004-05. The Commonwealth, with the agreement of Western Australia, intends to discharge the remaining five years of obligations, with a single one-off payment in 1999-2000 of $79,118,990. The payment is fair and equitable to the Commonwealth and Western Australia. It is based on agreed estimates of the future obligations discounted to a current value using discount rates derived from the Commonwealth's yield curve. Repeal of Section 130 is necessary for the Commonwealth to make the payment, as the Section as originally drafted did not foresee, nor allow, amounts in excess of the Commonwealth's retained gas royalty share to be transferred to Western Australia.</para><para>The payment will deliver administrative efficiencies and simplification of petroleum taxation revenue arrangements between the Commonwealth and Western Australia. By replacing the current complicated arrangements, the payment honours the Commonwealth's election commitment to review and simplify the administration of petroleum taxation arrangements.

In the House of Representatives the Senate amendments, which were government amendments, were rejected but identical amendments were made to the bill. This is on the basis of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel claiming that the amendments made in the Senate should have been requests. In my statement on 5 July, I pointed out that there was no basis for the amendments being requests. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel appears to be taking the view that any amendment which might result in increased expenditure should be a request, even if there is no appropriation in sight affected by the amendment. On this basis, virtually every amendment moved in the Senate would have to be a request and proceedings on all bills would be greatly prolonged. I should add that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel did not respond to a request by the Clerk of the Senate for an explanation of the amendments being framed as requests in the first place. The simplest way for the bill to proceed is for the Senate to agree to the amendments made in the House, which are identical to the amendments made in the Senate in the first place.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the committee agrees to the amendments made by the House of Representatives.</para></motion></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>14923</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I understood your statement, Madam Chair, the amendments now proposed by the House of Representatives are identical to the amendments carried in the Senate and therefore what the House of Representatives are asking us to do is to carry our amendments by agreeing to theirs.

My own suggestionâand I would like reaction from the Senate to itâis that this matter be adjourned to a later time today for consideration. It may be appropriate to adjourn this matter to later today, because the content of the amendments is not the issue; it is the nature of the interaction between the two houses which is the issue. I would like to ask the Clerk, through you, Madam Chair, if he could devise a motion for us which would say that, whilst we accept that these amendments go through, we do not accept that this represents a precedent. We do not accept the views of the House as regards the way in which these are to be dealt with, and we object to it. That may or may not be a useful way to do it, but if the amendments are not at question, if it is the process that is at question, then I think the Senate simply should not acknowledge that the process is valid but should allow the matter to go forward in a practical sense. That is a suggestion, but I would need advice on that and I am not in a position to discuss this matter with any real understanding or knowledge of what is entailed. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>14925</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am happy to have this adjourned until a later hour, but I would like to have it dealt with before 12.45 p.m. I also make the point that the statement that was read by you, Madam Chair, as you would know better than anybody in this chamber, is a statement that you have read on a range of bills when this situation occurs. It is an ongoing conflict between the Senate and the House of Representatives that is based particularly on an interpretation of the Constitution and of the forms of the House and that has been going on for a long time. It is not a new matter, and I find it surprising that senators who have been in this chamber for a long time have not noticed that the Chairman has read this out in the past. It is an ongoing dispute and the way it is being handled is the normal way, which is for the Senate to reiterateâwhich is quite properâthe continuing position of the Senate on these issues. It is a situation that has been well documented, and the Senate's view has been well argued, particularly by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate. This is a dispute that came to my attention when I first became Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I sought to resolve the dispute between the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Senate. I used my best negotiating skills over a very long period of time, skills which are clearly not as good as the skills of my counterpart on the other side of the chamber in negotiating Senate committee amendments on behalf of the ACTU and others. Those skills failed, and I gave up because I figured that the pragmatic solution is to do exactly what the Chairman has done this morning, which is to restate the Senate's position. It is an ongoing dispute. If anyone else can assist me in trying to negotiate a resolution on this, I welcome their assistance.</para></talk.start><para>But what needs to be understood is that this is not some new thing. The Labor Party were told exactly what we were doing with these amendments. They understand the amendments. The fact that we have created a hullabaloo over this this morning comes as somewhat of a surprise to me. I presume that the motives of those doing it are entirely worthy, and I am happy to go along with the concept of delaying it. But I would like to ensure that this matter is dealt with before 12.45 p.m. because if this arcane dispute between effectivelyâand I do not say this in a pejorative wayâsome bureaucrats is to hold up the program, it would turn it from being a matter of form substance into a matter of great delay, which will affect the people of Australia who will benefit from the provisions of the bill that we are trying to get through.

The motion of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is attractive, and we will support it if it is put to the vote. It seems to me to reflect the foreshadowed intention of the Australian Democrats and perhaps other speakers in this chamber, but that is for them to say. As for the opposition, we will support it. I do not intend to canvass this issue at great length. I am one of those who are notorious for not paying as much attention to the technical procedures as to the merit or substance of the issue. But it seems to me that the substance of the issue is met by the changes that the House have made to our amendments. Their insistence is that they move them, not us, and the question is a conflict between the chambers as to who takes precedence in this matter. That is an important issue, and I do not diminish it. But my immediate predilection is to go to the substanceâwhat material difference does it makeâand enable the chambers to continue an argument about the other matters. I thought that the foreshadowed intention of the Democrats in which we express a view and get on with the issue is probably the right outcome. An adjournment on this matter would enable us to give due consideration to it, and therefore we would support one.  </para></talk.start><para>Before I resume my seat, there is one other comment I would make. It may well beâand I do not dispute what the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has saidâthat this statement has been read out on other occasions.

I have just checked with my whip and the manager of business on our side and neither of them have knowledge of that. I want to say that for the record. I have not been consulted.

I just want to take a short time to address a few matters arising out of the bill. At the outset, I should say that there has been a very short time involved in the preparation of a rather lengthy report by both government and opposition, arising out of a very large bill, tabled less than one month ago in this place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There were in excess of 40 submissions received by the committee in a week. There were almost 20 hours of public hearing on the digital television and datacasting bill, and the committee concluded its hearings last Thursday at about 9 or 10 p.m. The report is being tabled now and, as I understand it, will be listed very early when we return to this place after a week's sitting break. There has been quite an unreasonable time frame from beginning to end, and the government's desire for haste has compromised the ability of relevant industries to formulate detailed responses to the inquiry.</para><para>The ALP minority report addresses critical issues in the bill within the framework of the 1998 legislation. It should be noted at the outset that there was and is criticism of the 1998 framework because of uncertainty facing HDTV around the world, technological convergence, and aspects of the current bill which go beyond understanding around the 1998 framework legislation. Labor senators address in some detail in their report the following issues: datacasting, multichannelling by the national broadcasters, spectrum loan to commercial TV stations and HDTV, enhanced programming, and a series of reviews which are part and parcel of the bill.</para><para>I will turn to each of those points in a little more detail. In respect of datacasting, which is a critical emerging industry for the passage of information in our society, Labor senators, after consideration, came to the view that the definition of `datacasting' as it stands in the bill is overly restrictive, complicated and goes beyond restricting datacasting to services that do not constitute broadcasting. Labor senators believe that, while datacasting cannot be de facto broadcasting, the definition should be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. Labor senators believe it is crucial that this emergent industry is not stifled in this development and innovative capacity by overly restrictive regulation and that the benefits for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services and employment and economic opportunities should not be constrained. Accordingly, Labor senators oppose the genre based content definition of datacasting and call upon the government to withdraw from that approach. Labor senators support an approach that favours flexibility, minimises barriers to entry and allows new services to develop over time. </para><para>In respect of the national broadcasters and datacasting, we regard the decision to impose datacasting fees on the national broadcasters as quite silly or nonsensical and call upon the government to reverse that decision. Similarly, the opposition senators believe that the national broadcastersâthe ABC and SBSâshould be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes. In respect of the datacasting transmission licences after the broadcast moratorium, Labor senators believe it is important that the post-moratorium arrangements for datacasting licences, which have a term of 10 years with a five-year option, be considered by early review. </para><para>Turning to multichannelling, perhaps the second most important issue in the debate around the bill, Labor senators believe that there is broad support for allowing the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel. Labor senators see no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel, particularly when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. </para><para>In terms of the debate concerning the spectrum loan to commercial television sta-tions and HDTV, there is some industry criticism of the government's policy decision to loan spectrum to commercial free-to-air broadcasters for the purpose of conversion to digital and HDTV. Labor senators believe that the arrangements mandating HDTV require early review to assess the continued mandating of HDTV broadcasting. In terms of enhanced programming, on the evidence it is a not unreasonable conclusion that the provisions of the bill allow simultaneous multiple broadcast of distinct substance, which could constitute de facto multichannelling. This allows the free-to-air broadcasters to compete with multichannelling services offered by the pay TV sector. After consideration, Labor senators have come to the view that the bill should be consistent with the minister's previous policy indications of what would comprise enhanced programming and the circumstances in which multichannelling in the case of an overlap would be permitted so that commercial free-to-air stations do not engage in de facto multichannelling.</para><para>In terms of the series of reviews that are part of the bill, in recognition of the transitional nature of the legislation the opposition is of the view that it is highly desirable that its consequences and efficacy are measured over the coming years to ensure that parliament's policy objectives are being properly and effectively implemented. Labor senators believe it is critical for the proposed reviews to be instigated, completed and their findings considered in a timely manner consistent with the industry's requirements for certainty. Accordingly, Labor senators believe it is pertinent for the reviews to be transparent and accountable to parliament. As such, they should be statutory and required by the legislation.</para><para>I was requested to be brief in my remarks. I just repeat that the critical issues of datacasting, multichannelling by commercial broadcasters, the spectrum loan to commercial television stations and HDTV, enhanced programming and the series of reviews are the matters the opposition senators have concentrated on in the bill process. Whilst we briefly addressed other matters raised in the public hearings, they are the critical matters in the bill and they are the matters we will be most likely moving amendments on when the bill is debated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>14929</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just want to speak briefly on the <inline ref="R1038">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000</inline> because I know we will have an opportunity to speak in more detail in the next session. I must say that I was intrigued by a number of the definitions that were bandied about. I think we are the only country in the world that has this term `datacasting'. From what I see as the definition of datacasting, it is pretty much a joke in terms of the technological age we live in. From what I understand from talking to people who are knowledgable in the industry and particularly in communications, this is a modern equivalent of putting someone with a red flag in front of a modern motor vehicle and walking down the expressway. We have modern technology now being restrained by what might be new technology.</para></talk.start><para>I was very impressed by the evidence given by Mr Encel, who was very concerned about the introduction of this new technology. He very much doubted whether the HDTV would bring the benefits to Australia that are being enunciated by people. If we extrapolate from the US experience, he said that on the basis of the percentage of the number of Australians as opposed to Americans we would only have 250 HDTV sets purchased here. The main reasons are the cost and the consumer resistance to it.</para><para>I have been asked to keep my comments short. In conclusion, I would like to say that I was very impressed by the people that came along from captioning. I was very impressed when they made the comment that the proprietor of Channel, Mr Kerry Stokes, seems to have gone out of his way to make sure captioning has been available to a large degree on his Prime Television. Mr Stokes, who I understand did not come from a privileged or advantaged background, I would think knows what it is to be disadvantaged and to be held back in this world and he has certainly done his bit for people who are hearing impaired.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14929</page.no><id.no>R1046</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRODUCT GRANTS AND BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1050</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FUEL SALES GRANTS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1047</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>14929</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>14929</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese bills are on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>at No. 2. The <inline ref="R1005">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000</inline> is on at No. 1, but my understanding is that the government does not wish to proceed with that bill today. In any case, I might say the minister is refusing to answer questions, which I think is a very disgraceful performance by him. It is something that we will have to pay attention to when that bill comes back on.</para></talk.start><para>Let me turn to the bills now before the chamber. The <inline ref="R1046">Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000</inline> and related bills are but another example of the incompetence of the minister responsible for the detailed implementation of the GST, Senator Kemp, to try and win favour with the vast, vanishing support base for the GST in country Australia. As the government continue to realise the devastation they are about to wreak on rural and regional Australia, they have finally realised what the ALP has been saying since 1998, that is, that the GST will push the price of petrol up in the bush and the gap between rural and city petrol prices, otherwise known as the fuel price differential, will only get worse thanks to the GST. After all, it is simple arithmetic. If you are living in Kalgoorlie and paying 10c or more per litre for your petrol than if you were living in Perth, then when it is taxed by 10 per cent under the GST you will pay an extra cent on your petrol. That is because of the percentage nature of the tax. So there is in-built discrimination in the GST against people living in country Australia, where there are higher costs for most consumer goods.</para><para>This package of bills seeks to provide a tiered system of grants for petrol sales to consumers in the bush with a higher rate of grant to be provided to sales in more remote rural areas. The scheme is estimated to cost $500 million over four years from the financial year 2000-01, although at the recent Senate estimates committee hearing we discovered that another $19.6 million will be required to operate and administer the scheme. A central component of this cost is an as yet undefined centralised computer system that will link all of the participating service stations to a central computer database. No doubt they will provide confidential information to the ATO for the government to use, as it has done in the recent ABN application of information on the Australian electoral roll.  </para><para>This scheme, though, represents a vindication of the position argued by Labor going back before the last election, when we pointed out that including petrol in the GST would widen the city-country petrol price differential. For a long time the government resisted this argument and claimed it was not so, but this legislation is an admission and an acknowledgment by the government of the fact that the GST will indeed push up petrol prices in country Australia. The government's plan involves reducing the excise on fuel by a set amount, such as 7c or 8c per litre, and then imposing the 10 per cent GST on fuel. The formula will have effect depending upon the retail price at the time. For example, if the existing retail price of petrol were 77c, removing 7c of excise and imposing a 10 per cent GST, that is, 7c, would have no effect, therefore, on the retail price. </para><para>However, as anyone who has driven around the country or who lives in the country or who has spent any time in country areas will readily understand, at various petrol stations around the country there will be prices in excess of 70c per litre. Indeed, to cite Kalgoorlie, where my electorate office is at the present time, it is not unusual to encounter petrol prices of 98c per litre or more. Generally, the further away you get from the metropolitan area the higher that price differential becomes. For example, if you have a petrol station in country New South Wales which currently charges 87c, there will be a price effect whereby it reduces the price by 7c a litre for the excise reduction but then the 10 per cent GST kicks in. It would add 10 per cent of 80c, that is, 8c. The retail price in that country service station would increase from 87c to 88c because of the GST. There is still a price rise. There is still a widening gap between the city and the country. The city-country price differential increases. </para><para>Where a petrol station is very remote, as in outback Australiaâand we are all aware of examples of that in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, remote western Queensland and New South Walesâthe price will be even higher, which will mean greater than a 1c per litre increase. That price effect is an inescapable mathematical fact, despite the weasel words in the ANTS package that no petrol price need rise. It is important to remember that this is what the government saidâthat no petrol price need rise. If you just plainly look at the facts, that is not true. </para><para>To overcome the problem, various state ministers, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the former Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, were saying before the election that no petrol price would rise. That is palpably untrue. Despite their claims, Labor continually pointed out that this promise was undeliverable under the original ANTS package. Motoring organisations, and in particular the Australian Automobile Association, the most prestigious body representing Australian motorists, confirmed Labor's argument. The only ones in a state of denial are people like Senator Kemp and others in the government who are responsible for the design and implementation of the GSTâalthough Senator Kemp has become universally known as the minister responsible for the detailed failure of the implementation of the GST. </para><para>We did see, though, at one stage the Treasurer, Mr Costello, actually attempt to walk away from the promise that fuel need not rise as a result of the GST. He did that on the Laurie Oakes <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program when he said that there were limits to that promise. Before the election a promise that petrol need not rise and after the election an admission by the Treasurer that there were limits to that promise. This was basically Treasurer Costello attempting to redefine the government's commitment from a core to a non-core promiseâweasel words at their worst. </para><para>What the Treasurer was trying to do was to dud country Australia. We all know that Treasurer Costello has a contempt for country Australia. He hardly ever goes there or, when he does, it is in a Commonwealth car with tinted glass windows so he cannot be recognised. We know what the Treasurer's answer is to the problems faced by those in the bush. His answer is `Cut their wages.' According to the Treasurer, people in the bush are paid too much and the only way you will get more jobs in country Australia is to cut the wages of rural and regional workers. So the Treasurer's solution to the problems in rural and regional Australia is to put up their fuel, impose a 10 per cent GST on almost everything they buy and, what is more, pay them less for their efforts. Is it any wonder that rural and regional Australian Liberal MPs are not clamouring to take the Treasurer on visits with them to country electorates? He is political poison.  </para><para>What about the poor old pitiful National Party in all of this? Their raison d'etre is to stand up for country Australia. They do not represent anyone anymore. Respected by nobody, least of all the Liberal Party and the Treasurer, in particular, they are no more than the old obedient and trusty sheep dog, ready to be trodden on and kicked about by their Liberal Party masters, led by the Treasurer. It is really quite sadâthe grand old and once proud National Party firmly on the Costello leash, told where to stand, when to sit, when to speak and, on the odd occasion when they try to speak out, when to shut up. Like the old, tired, obedient sheep dog this is exactly what they do. Black Jack McEwen must be turning in his grave.</para><para>To look at these measures in a little more detail, I now turn to the main bill. The main bill establishes a grants scheme to fuel retailers in respect of sales in non-metropolitan and remote areas to end users. A grant will apply to all sales after 1 July. This bill is notable because it is particularly light in any detail at all. What it does is establish a registration system for the grants, but it does precious little else. It merely establishes a framework for the grants. To obtain a grant, a person has to register under the scheme, and there is simply no detail provided about the key points. For example: where are the non-metropolitan locations that qualify for the grants? They are not set out in the bill. The government cannot tell usâand this was confirmed in the recent Senate estimates. This is the old argument on conurbations that we had previously and this is an argument that is being revisited: where are the boundaries for the fuel grants scheme? We need to know where the boundaries are to know who is eligible. If we do not have boundaries, we do not know who is eligible and there is confusion as a consequence. The bottom line is that Senator Kemp does not know because he is still waiting for Liberal Party headquarters to tell him where the final boundaries of the Liberal Party's most marginal seats will be as a result of the current redrawing of electoral boundaries. That is what politics in Australia has come down to: cut the boundaries according to political necessity; do not cut the boundaries according to economic need.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âWhat we did see, Senator, in the case of the diesel fuel grants scheme, was a trip between Canberra and Queanbeyan qualifying for a diesel fuel grant, yet a trip between Melbourne and Geelong does not. Why was that? Because Queanbeyan is in the marginal Liberal seat of Eden-Monaro and Geelong is in the safe Labor seat of Corio; therefore, discriminate against Geelong, provide the grant to Eden-Monaro. So, until the government knows the final boundaries of the marginal seats, we will not know where the boundaries will be in the fuel sales grants scheme.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is just one of the outstanding issues, but there are many more. For example: where are the remote locations that qualify for a higher level of grant? Again, they are not set out in the bill. We do not know. What is the rate of the grant in various locations? Again, they are not set out in the bill. We do not know. All of these issues are absolutely basic, fundamental points and are to be given to us in the form of regulations, we are told, at some as yet undefined time. We are told this bill is urgent, but we do not know when the regulations will be tabled that tell us the critical detail about how this bill in fact will operate. We once again have Senator Kemp not telling the parliament or the community anything in the way of detail concerning this legislation, although to expect anything more from the Assistant Treasurerâwe know on this side of the chamberâwould be stretching his ministerial capability beyond anybody's expectation. </para><para>Put simply, this bill is a farce. It gets the newspaper headline; it announces `$500 million'âand then quietly, `over four years', and says that this is the answer to the prayer of motorists in the bush; but then it does not provide any detail to say how this prayer will be answered. One can be forgiven for assuming that the purpose of this bill was to get the headline and not deal with the problem. It does not clarify any of the details which are necessary for this parliament to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. This is a house of review. How can we review whether this legislation does what the government claims it will do, without the detail? We are most concerned that the government have not yet actually settled the detail of the boundaries, yet they are able to tell us with certainty how much the scheme will cost. They know the price, but they just cannot tell us how it will be spent. All we have is the Treasurer's announcement that non-metropolitan locations will get 1c per litre grants and remote areas will get 2c or, possibly, more. Where is the detail? It is clear that this is a proposal arrived at on the run in the government's panic about being caught out, yet again, on another undeliverable GST promise.</para><para>Let me also make the observation that this scheme is not a benefit, as the government would portray it to be and would have us believe it is, but simply an attempt to offset an adverse impact of the GST on the country price differential. Therefore, to portray it as some sort of gift to regional and rural Australia is wrong. It is in fact ameliorating damage to regional and rural Australia. Because we do not have the detail, to what extent will it succeed? And one knows, because of the price differentials, it is unlikely to succeed all of the wayâbut it will not even do that. We had evidence presented to the Senate estimates committee that the full $500 million will not even flow through to consumers in the country. This is because the government has admitted that petrol station participants can offset the cost of complying with the grants scheme from the grants they have received from the $500 million that has been allocated. But guess what: the government cannot even tell us what the compliance costs will be. So we have a scheme with no boundaries, no rates, no idea of how much it will cost in terms of compliance and no idea of how the $500 million was calculated in the first place. `Think of a figure' appears to be the way in which it was approached. Yet we are told with certainty that it will ensure that the price of fuel need not rise as a result of the GST. Wait for the horse laugh from country Australia!</para><para>The government can rely on hope, because this is the only thing they have going for them in these circumstances. What we do know is that the GST will put up the price of fuel in the bush; the GST will worsen the city-country price differential. The government's only answer to this problem and others in the bush is to slash the wages of rural workers, as outlined by the Treasurer and aided and abetted by the tired old, but obedient in this case, National Party. This is the perverseness of the government's position. They want to put up the price of petrol in country Australia, put a brand new 10 per cent GST on almost everything people in the bush purchase, and the Treasurer wants to slash their wages with which they are to pay for the higher priced fuel and higher priced goods and services as a consequence of the GST. That is the government's plan for regional and rural Australia. No wonder Senator Macdonald is not in the chamber to face the music. </para><para>I also note that we have before us the <inline ref="R1050">Product Grants and Benefits Administration Bill 2000</inline> As with the main Fuel Sales Grants Bill, this bill is deficient in terms of detail. We are not told in this bill how often the grants are to be paid, or what the base is for calculating the grants. That is not there. Is the basis past sales, or is it anticipated sales? No detail given. Is the grant subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient? We do not knowâno detail. What records have to be kept in order to satisfy the requirements of the scheme? We still do not know. The government criticises those who criticise that there is insufficient information to enable small business in this country to prepare for the GST. If they put through legislation like this with no detail, how can small business be expected to know what they are supposed to do? Since ignorance of the law is no defence, if the law is unspecific and no-one knows, how can they then be prosecuted if there are breaches, or how can they then be denied an entitlement if the government will not tell them what they should do to apply? </para><para>We can see that this bill covers such administrative matters as method of registration and cancellation of registration; assessments and payments of claims; record keeping requirements; compliance enforcement measures, such as those against schemes which attempt to abuse the grants scheme; recovery of unpaid debts; penalties for false statements, et cetera, and information gathering and access powers for the Commissioner of Taxation, including secrecy provisions. In regard to the secrecy provisions, given the ATO's form to date, one has to question how protected confidential taxpayer information will be. We know that some taxpayer information is being sold by the tax office. I would therefore like to ask Senator Kemp this: once the government has its centralised fuel grants scheme computer database up and running, what, if any, information will be publicly available? What, if any, taxpayer information will be made available for sale? And will the government be using this database in order to conduct another taxpayer funded mail-out?</para><para>Labor understands that this scheme represents some form of compensation for the GST and, accordingly, the Labor Party will not be opposing these bills. We do commend the government for finally admitting that the GST will force up the price of fuel in country Australia. It has been our consistent position throughout the GST debate that, while we oppose the GST and believe that the compensation measures are inadequate, they should not be opposed; and we will not be opposing them.

I want to note some matters which the government could consider in the regulations to be made under this billâspecifically, the number of, and amount given to, the grant categories. I will not speak too long on the matter, but I do want to take the chamber to some particular issues.</para></talk.start><para>On 11 April, when the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer announced the fuel sales grants program, the Australian Democrats welcomed the announcement of the $500 million grants scheme to equalise fuel price effects in regional Australia following the introduction of the GST. A grants scheme is certainly preferable to greater cuts to excise rates across the board, which would have delivered lower fuel prices to city motorists, significantly reduced revenue and actually increased fuel price disparity. Our concern is much more about the city-country fuel price disparity. On 11 April I also acknowledged that it was the obvious way to equalise GST effects and that, had an across-the-board reduction in excise been used as the mechanism for the government to keep its promise, the country-city fuel disparity would have increased. So the Australian Democrats, at an adviser level and publicly on the record, had discussions with the government about such a scheme. These discussions were undertaken with the view that the grants should be done on the basis of transportation costs.</para><para>The current excise arrangement sees the government attain something like 44.15c per litre for unleaded fuel and 46.6c per litre for leaded fuels. This totals to $13 billion or $14 billion per annum. With the implementation of the GST, the government will need to adjust down the current excise levels to be able to not significantly increase fuel prices from 1 July. As all of us are all too aware, there is a serious disparity between the petrol pricing in the cities and in rural and regional areas around the country. This will mean that a straight reduction in the excise will not prevent an increase in fuels in rural and regional areas, if it is pegged particularly to the average retail price in the cities. The Australian Democrats recognised some time ago that a method of altering the excise or some other rebate scheme is necessary to avoid greater disadvantage to rural and regional areas than already exists as a result of lower levels of competition and, particularly, higher transportation costs. </para><para>As a matter of fact, and I note what the Labor Party have said, the GST presented an opportunity for one of the three elements of petrol price disparity to be removedâthat being the cost of transportationâhence leaving only lower through-put levels with competition and the number of sites as issues that need to be addressed in helping deal with the country-city fuel price disparities. The government's policy document, <inline font-style="italic">Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system</inline>, released in August 1998, stated:</para><quote><para>At the time of the introduction of the GST, the Government will reduce excise on petrol and diesel so that the pump price for these commodities for consumers need not rise.</para></quote><para>To achieve that particular promise, it was estimated that the rate of excise would need to be reduced by 7c a litre, with the reduction being replaced by the GST payable. Businesses, of course, able to claim input tax credits will be able to claim the amount of GST on petrol. The promise made then was repeated a number of times during the campaign for the October 1998 election. I want to put on the record that the Prime Minister stated:</para><quote><para>And because the price of petrol at the pump doesn't rise you will find in business that your petrol is seven cents a litre cheaper.</para></quote><para>Later on he said:</para><quote><para>The price of petrol at the bowser will not go up ... The excise will come down by the amount that is the equivalent of the GST and the price will not go up 1 cent at the bowser.</para></quote><para>I think one of the difficulties in being able to implement the promise arises from the fact that, in regional and remote areas, petrol prices are generally higher than in metropolitan locations. The addition of a 10 per cent GST to a higher base price will result in the final price being greater than adding 10 per cent to a lower base. For example, if petrol in a metropolitan area retails for 77c per litre and excise is reduced by 7c per litre, the addition of a 10 per cent GST will result in the same retail price of 77c per litre. However, if the retail price is 90c per litre in a regional or remote area and excise is reduced by 7c per litre, the GST will be added to a base price of 83c per litre, leading to a final price of 91.3c per litre. This essentially means that the retail price has increased by 1.3c per litre, due to the replacement of part of the excise payable with the GST. Recently, these issues have come up in Tasmania, where they have seen prices of over 90c per litre in category; whereas in Sydney it has been, in places, just over the 80c mark. So, as prices increase in both metropolitan and regional and rural areas, it can be expected that the additional amount payable, due to the GST, will in fact increase.</para><para>However, whether prices have been reduced at the pump by the amount of the grant will depend on the prices charged throughout the supply chain, which will involve a number of decision makers. I want to take the Senate to a number of examples. If a wholesaler decides to increase its price or reduce a current discount to a particular outlet in an area, or to all outlets in an area, there is going to be difficulty, in the absence of any contrary evidence, in determining that it is due to the grant being offset. These are things that I think the government needs to take note of. While the ACCC may be successful in determining where prices have increased to make a windfall gain of the grant amount, the matter must be in doubt, given the current relatively much greater variations in prices. With regional prices currently varying from the metropolitan price by large amounts, for example, from 0.2c per litre in Berri through to 7.9c per litre in Bateman's Bay, I think the challenge for the government is really about ensuring that the grant is not exploited in the future. That would appear to be a difficult task to police. </para><para>It was for this reason that the proposal the Australian Democrats worked on had eight categories, starting from 0.5c per litre to 4c per litre. Although this made it slightly more difficult to set up, the information systems available these days would mean that the paperwork would be no greater than what is currently required. There is one thing that the Democrats' policy did deliverâthat is, a more realistic representation of what the cost differentials are. Also important is that the logic behind our scheme is, as alluded to earlier, the removal of transportation costs from the fuel equation. As it stands at the moment, I am not quite sure whether what the government has proposed will deliver what it expects. I might add that, although we suggested eight categories, it is also costed at approximately $500 million over four years. </para><para>I think that the ACCC is going to have its work cut out in attempting to see that this grant is passed on. This is especially true considering the lack of transparency that continues to exist in this industry. I hope that the Treasurer and the government do give consideration to changes to the structure. I look forward to the government getting serious about change in the petroleum industry generally. The industry wants an oil code, some security in tenure and a program that will help small petrol station operators exit the industry where it is unviable for either them or their market to remain. There are smaller and smaller margins at all points within the industry. I think it is these smaller margins that, for the most part, have contributed to the industry being subjected to some 47 inquiries over many years. It is also of concern that only a small proportion of the excise is actually marked for infrastructure development, with the remainder being placed into consolidated revenue. These are important points, because I think moneys from the excise really need to be marked for both road and rail development. Moneys need to be made available to help make some of the structural changes needed to make this industry, again, one that is viable for small business operators.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1046">Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000</inline> and the related bills are, I believe, a step in the right direction in assisting rural and regional Australia. It is a step in the right direction towards dealing with petrol price disparity. It is, however, a pity that it appears this is the only step being made to address the problem. It is tragic for public policy that this has only come about as a result of the effects of the GST. It is a problem that existed well before then.</para><para>The Australian Democrats support the bill. However we believe that, as it stands, it will not deliver on the government's election promises that fuel prices would not increase. As such, I would encourage the government and the Treasurer to seriously consider the issues I have raised today when implementing the regulations for this bill and the package of related bills. Finally, I also note the circulation of late amendments on behalf of the government to improve the capacity of the ACCC to police. I can flag now that we have no difficulties in supporting those. I note also the amendment moved on behalf of the opposition by Senator Cook, and I flag now that we will not be supporting that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>14935</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1046">Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000</inline> and related bills do a number of things in respect of fuel prices in this country. Firstly, they provide a tiered system of grants for petrol sales to consumers in non-metropolitan areas, with a higher rate of grant to be provided for sales in remote areas. Secondly, they standardise the administrative framework for grants and benefits administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. Thirdly, they ensure that the grants are covered under the Taxation Administration Act 1953, like other taxes in such areas as prosecutions, offences, et cetera. The estimated cost of the scheme is $500 million over four years, from the year 2000-01. It is important to point out that this is an additional cost to budget that was not factored in to the government's tax package that was taken to the last election.</para></talk.start><para>From Labor's perspective, the bills represent a vindication of the criticisms we made prior to the last election that a differential in petrol prices between urban and rural and regional areas would emerge and that the differential would get worse as a result of the GST. The Liberal-National government's plan involves reducing the excise on fuel by a set amountâfor example, 7c or 8c a litreâand then imposing the 10 per cent GST on top. The effect of this formula will depend upon the retail price at the time. For example, if the retail price of petrol is 77c, the 7c on excise will be removed and a 10 per cent GST will be imposed, which is equivalent to 7c, and there will be no effect on the retail price. However, at many petrol stations in rural and regional areas, some prices are above 77c. Generally, the further you go from the major metropolitan areas, such as Melbourne and Sydney, the higher the price differential for petrol. </para><para>If you apply the formula to a petrol station in my home state of Tasmania which currently charges 87câand I would say in passing that the petrol prices in Tasmania have been up to $1 in the last few months, but I will use 87c by way of an exampleâyou would face the following price effect: there would be a reduction of 7c a litre for excise, you would then add 10 per cent GST, which would add 8c on top. So you end up with an additional 1c a litre on a base of 87 cents. To use my home state of Tasmania as an example, petrol is higher than 87 centsâgenerally in the low nineties, depending on where you purchase itâso, as a result of the GST, people in Tasmania will face a higher petrol price of 1c plus. This is in stark contrast to the commitment given by the Liberal-National parties prior to the last election that this would not occur.</para><para>The price effect I have outlined is an inescapable mathematical fact. It is based on the fact that petrol prices in most rural and regional areas are higher than in Sydney or Melbourne. The ANTS packageâthe government's propaganda document that they took to the last electionâsaid that no petrol price need rise. To overcome the problems, we have had various government ministersâthe Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischerâpledging that no petrol price would rise. There is a clear difference between `no petrolprice need rise' and `no petrol price would rise'. This government ignored this problem prior to the last election, and Labor has continually pointed out that the promise that was made under the original ANTS package was undeliverable. It is not just Labor that has said this; motoring organisations have also done so. The Australian Automobile Association in particular  has consistently confirmed Labor's arguments. Even that well-known public commentator, Mr Terry McCrannâwho is not a favourite of the Labor Party's, I might sayâhas made very similar observations.</para><para>After the election, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, attempted to walk away from the promise when he said to Laurie Oakes on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program that there were limits to the promise. If you look through the government's documentâthe ANTS packageâthere were no such limits outlined prior to the election. The comment made by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, caused outrage, as it should have, in regional Australia. This in turn led the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to very firmly rebuke the Treasurer the following day by saying that the promise would be honoured in full. The comments by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, came a short time after his famous pre-Christmas message to Australians who live in regional Australia that they should take a cut in their wages. After two or three attempts to clarify what he meant, the Treasurer backed down on that matter as well. I might say that there was considerable criticism of the Treasurer in respect of lower wages in rural and regional Australia, and not just from our side of politics.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1046">Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000</inline> establishes a grants scheme to fuel retailers with respect to sales in non-metropolitan and remote areas to end users. This grant will apply to all such sales after 1 July. The sale is when the fuel is delivered, not when it is paid for, and the bill establishes a framework for these grants. In respect of these, there simply is not a great deal of detail about some critical issuesâfor example, which non-metropolitan locations qualify for the grants, which remote locations qualify for the higher grants, and the rates of grants at the various places. We have to remember that there are about 5,000 petrol retailers in this country, so it is a very important issue. The details have not been released to the public, other than the Treasurer announcing that non-metropolitan locations will get 1c per litre grants and remote areas will get 2c. This bill is simply a farce when it comes to dealing with these issuesâit does not clarify what are the critical issues to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. Just like the diesel fuel grants for heavy transport vehicles, the government has not settled the details of the boundary changes. </para><para>We have seen a number of examples of major changes to policy, carried out on the run, with respect to the GST. We had another example in the other place yesterday, when Minister Anthony rolled out the so-called compensation for people who were not to benefit from tax cuts as a result of the implementation of the GST. I would also point out that it is the responsibility of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, to give us the detailsâit is one of his tasks delegated from the Treasurer. We look forward to his providing us with the details, but they should have been provided long before this.</para><para>The grants and administration bill will impose further compliance requirements on petrol retailers in this country. As if the GST itself is not going to be difficult enough, they will have an additional compliance burden placed on them. The cost of compliance will obviously be met by the retailer, and most of these petrol retailers are small businesses which are battling. But this legislation does not make this point clear. It is not known whether it is expected that the petrol retailer will have to make a loss as a result of them having to administer this particular scheme. So you have petrol retailers caught in a vice-like grip of administrative bureaucracy as a result of the GST package. On the one side they have to meet the requirements of the introduction of a GST and, on the other side, they are going to have to administer this grants scheme. How on earth do petrol retailers work out the costs of compliance when many of the details in this scheme are simply not provided? How often are the grants to be paid? What is the base for calculating the grants? Is it going to be past sales or anticipated sales? Is the grant subject to income tax for the recipient? What records have to be kept in order to satisfy the requirements of the scheme? The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, should come into this chamber and explain these details. It is obviously important to us as legislators, but it is particularly important to petrol retailers in this country, especially with the GST due to start in a few weeks.</para><para>There are two other points I want to deal with with respect to this legislation. The enforcement role of the ACCC is important with respect to petrol prices in this country. My colleagues, Senator Murphy and Senator Conroy, and I spent some time exploring this issue with the ACCC in front of Senate estimates last week. We asked questions of Mr Asher, who was representing the ACCCâMr Fels had gone off to do another press conference, but that is another story. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âThe three millionth press conference?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âI think it was No. 299, according to the press release I was questioning Professor Fels about. Anyway, we can check that later for accuracy. It is certainly a substantial number so far this year. Mr Asher could not give a guarantee that fuel grants would be passed on to Australian motorists. So the ACCCâthe regulator of the GST implementation in this country; supposedly there to ensure that there is not exploitation of consumersâcannot give an undertaking or a guarantee. Mr Asher was refreshingly frank when he said that they could not give a guarantee. He explained the practical difficulties in managing the schemes we are considering in this legislation. He pointed out that there are 5,000 petrol retailers in the country and that the ACCC would be monitoring about half of them. Under very incisive questioning from my colleagues, he explained that it was very difficult to monitor all 5,000 petrol stations in Australia. Of course, it is particularly difficult to monitor those petrol stations in rural and regional areas for obvious logistical reasons in terms of distance. So there is no guarantee that, when this scheme is implemented, motorists will benefit and that we will not see an increase in the price differential in at least some rural and regional areas.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>Unfortunately, we do not have the transcript available yet, but we did go to the point of whether or not a petrol retailer can absorb their compliance costs within, effectively, the subsidy paid to them to pass on to consumers, and the ACCC were not able to clarify this point. I put it to the Senate: with additional compliance burdens being placed on petrol retailers in this countryâthe vice that I referred to earlierâis it fair and reasonable for them to have to carry the additional costs, the paperwork, the bureaucratic burden? I would suggest that it is not. I would suggest that petrol retailers in this country, small business operators, are really going to be scrutinising this government and casting a harsh judgment, along with many other small businesses, at the next election. </para><para>There is one other point I wish to makeâand I will conclude on this pointâand that is the failure of the National Party, yet again, to defend the interests of people living in rural and regional Australia. It is not only with respect to petrol pricesâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âA sad failure.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âIt is a sad failure. The performance of the National Party in recent times is somewhat pathetic with respect to not only the price of petrol in rural and regional but also the GST itself. How on earth could the National Party, supposedly representing farmers, accept the proposition that the implementation of a GST would be offset by income tax cuts, when half the farmers in this country do not pay income tax because they are not earning anything? They are drawing down on their capital; so they in fact have negative incomes at the present time. How on earth can the National Party be effectively not just conned but trampled on by the Liberal Party with respect to the GST? How on earth could the National Party accept that many farmers in this country are going to suffer as a result of the GST? There is no effective compensation. I had a discussion with a number of small farmers down at the Forth Pub about this issue a couple of weeks ago, and they pointed that out to me in no uncertain terms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have got two streams in the National Party in this country. We have got the old socialist strain, as represented by Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell is fairly rough and gruff but he believes in socialism, as long as socialism starts 50 kilometres outside the CBD of Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. Senator Boswell is an old-style socialist. Then we have, for example, Senator McGauran, a more urbane, smoother intellectual type in the National Party. He may as well be a Liberal. But the point is that Senator McGauran and similar National Party members have the predominant say in the National Party caucus and they are constantly overruling the attempts of people like Senator Boswell to defend the interests of people in rural and regional Australia. I do not know why the National Party simply do not pack up and those who are effectively Liberals join the Liberal Party and those who are effectively the old-style agrarian socialists like Senator Boswell join the Labor Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âAn invitation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âI notice, Senator Kemp, that the National Party's Senator McGauran, because of the coalition deal in Victoria, was actually ahead of you on the Senate ticket. That does highlight at least one of the motivations for the National Party trying to continue in existence. But the basic fact is that the National Party, in respect of the GST, in respect of the issue of petrol prices and in respect of basic education and health services in rural and regional areas, has been a manifest failure in defending the interests of rural and regional people against the urban economic interests of the big end of town, the Liberal Party. This bill is further evidence of the National Party's increasing irrelevance in this country and its failure to represent rural and regional interests. We have seen this highlighted in a number of recent electoral outcomes, where the National Party has been defeated in a number of rural and regional areas, as it should have been.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I conclude my remarks by saying in summary that we are supporting this legislation. It is okay as far as it goes, but we still lack important details. It is yet another piece of legislation as a result of the GST.

We were finding it very difficult and in fact could not get any information. We were told the information would be forthcoming. The Treasurer also made a statement on 11 April. He said at that time:</para><quote><para>We are using an established index that measures remoteness, and it applies from outside the built-up metropolitan area.</para></quote><para>If it is so established, why couldn't we be given it and why couldn't we get responses to our questions during estimates? To actually work out your $500 million, there had to be some assessment of the number of litres that have been sold in the respective areas, remote or metropolitan. You had to do that to make any judgment at all. So I think that the Treasurer's statement is probably half accurate and that there is some information about. The problem with the information is that it is still very much untested and there is still a lot of concern about exactly where you draw the lines on the maps. I do not think they have really finalised it at all. That is why the bill actually says the amount `will vary depending on the total of eligible claims'.</para><para>Another aspect of that really relates to claims. What is the process here? We are told that there has been monitoring of a number of service stations throughout this country. I think the Treasurer said about 200; the evidence to the estimates committee was substantially more than that. I think there were about 8,300 service stations throughout the country, and we might find that up to half of these might be eligible for making a grants claim. I am not sure exactly what the circumstances will beâI suppose this will all become evident as time goes byâbut it is very unfortunate that we are in a position where we have a proposal for legislation to go through this place and we have no idea about how it is really going to work; we cannot ask any questions about particular matters that relate to its operation. Going back to the compliance issue, we asked questions through the estimates process about the people actually administering this schemeâthat is, the petrol retailersâand whether they are entitled to make some claim with regard to the administration costs associated with operating this grants scheme. Again, it was very unclear, although I thought the indication was that they would be entitled to make a claim for administrative costs and I thoughtâand I stand to be corrected on this, and maybe the minister when he gets up can actually deal with this matterâthat there was an indication that they could make a claim and the cost of administration to the retailer would come out of the $500 million or whatever it might end up being.  </para><para>There were also some other issues that arose with regard to administration and whether or not the scheme could be rorted. The ACCC gave us a range of evidence that went to the possibility of rorting the scheme and, despite its best effort, I think there is a major concern that rorting is a real possibility. Will all this be passed on to the motorist? The real intention of this is to ensure that the cost ratio, the cost differential, between city and country pricesâor indeed prices per se, because that is what it comes back toâand also the price of petrol will not increase as a result of the GST, and I will add a bit more to that in a moment. How do we actually guarantee that this gets passed on to the motorist, the consumer? It is going to be very difficult. If we look at all of the problems that we have had associated with fuel substitution and the total inability to even begin to address those issues, I cannot see at this point how you can ever guarantee that these costs are actually going to be passed on to the motorist and that the retailers are not going to be just taking extra profit. </para><para>With regard to the cost impact on the consumer, we have had various statements over a period of time. I want to go back to some of those with regard to the cost of fuel as it relates to the introduction of the GST. In August 1998 the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>The ordinary motorist will not pay any more for petrol. But, of course, they will not get that reduction. They will not pay any more. It won't go up. The price at the pump will be the same.</para></quote><para>In September 1998âit was just a month laterâthe Treasurer said that no petrol price would rise as a result of the GST `anywhere'. That is a fairly strong and expansive statementâand I notice that Senator McGauran is nodding his head in agreement with that. We also had Mr Mark Vaile saying the same thing at about the same time, on 14 January. This issue must have worked a few people up into a bit of a fervour because on 14 January this year the financial services minister went one step further in respect of that. He said that petrol prices would actually fall. He said they would not go up, they would actually fall. I suppose it might have been part of the position of jockeying for advancement in the Howard government ministry. </para><para>Now we come to our very noble Senator Kemp. On 8 February he actually said that the government would `stick to its policy'âwe seem to be having great variation from falling petrol prices to no increase, to no increase anywhereâand that petrol prices `need not rise'. We are going backwards again now. `Need not rise'âthere is no guarantee that it will not rise. Despite the Treasurer's commitment and the fact of the Prime Minister's commitment, Senator Kemp, being very much more conservative, said petrol prices `need not rise'. Of course, we then gotâI think it was the next dayâthe Prime Minister on 9 February coming out and saying:</para><quote><para>The imposition of the GST is not going to produce an increase in the price of petrol.</para></quote><para>So we are back on to no increase againânot `need not rise' but no increase. Then with regard to the process it all started to gel, it all started to come out and it started to hit the government in the face that this was a major problem, and the Treasurer says, `Well, there are limits on this.' With regard to the `need not rise', the `will not rise' and the `and/or will fall' issue, how is it going to be the case that, with at least a six per cent increase in the CPI as a result of the GST, petrol prices will not go up? It is just not possible. Petrol prices will go up, and will go up quite substantially.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>âNot in Collins Street.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âProbably not.

But, as I said, if you have an increase in the CPI of more than six per cent as a result of the GST, how is it that petrol prices will not go up? The Australian Automobile Association pointed out correctly the fact that, if you look at a 2c a litre increaseâwhich I think is equivalent to a six per cent increase in the CPI; that actually bumps petrol prices up by about 2c a litreâthe excise revenue that the government would get as a result of that would be about $400 million. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It seems to me that there is a bit of a sleight of hand here. The government has made a promise to consumers on the price of petrol: `To offset the introduction of the GST, we're going to give you one or two cents a litre off depending on where you live. But in the meantime you are going to be smacked with a huge increase in the CPI that is going to cost you at least 2c a litre more for your petrol and is going to give us the money to pay you in the first place.' I think the suggestion of the Australian Automobile Association was right: the government ought to consider, at least for a period of time, moves to offset that. But there has been no indication of thatânone whatsoever. When we started off with the ANTS package, the slogan was `A new tax system, not a new tax.' As if that hasn't been lost in the ether! It is a new tax, all right, and it is going to hit people very severely, particularly in respect of petrol.</para><para>I asked some questions on the petrol issue during the estimates process because I was curious about this whole monitoring issueâthe administration of it and how we could make sure that people would not be ripped off. What has happened with regard to petrol prices in Queensland recently? Why has there been a significant jump in the price of petrol there? We know that Queensland does not have a state excise on petrol, but prices went up substantially there. I was unable to get from various officials any explanation as to why that occurred, so I find it difficult to accept that we are going to have in place an administrative process that will guarantee that consumers will not be ripped off. If occurrences in a state appear to be without any explanation and yet there are people who are supposed to be monitoring these things, then how is it that we cannot get an explanation? As I said earlier, how is it that we are yet to work out exactly where the lines on the maps will be?</para><para>Let us go back to the statements that have been made consistently by the Prime Minister, by the Treasurer and by Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp has probably been the most consistent of any of themâat least he has only had the one line, which is that prices `need not rise'. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister said, `I can only repeat what patently is our case; that is, we are going to honour our commitment.' I respect the Prime Minister for making that statement, but there is nothing in place to underpin it. There is no explanation that would give any comfort to anybody that that can actually be achievedânone whatsoever. So we are here debating legislation that is going to go through this place, and we are the people charged with the responsibility of overseeing the government's policy in this respect, yet we have no explanations on where the lines are, the administration of it and how it is going to workânothing. It is deplorable that the government has that sort of approach and that it expects us to accept it on face value. You cannot do that, because of all of the other aspects of your legislation and the promises that you have made, none of which have ultimately been delivered.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWait till 1 July.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âWait till 1 July!

You can tell us that you are going to guarantee that the consumers will get the benefit of this, which is something that we will all wait with bated breath to hear. The government might also address its mind to the CPI increase that will occur as a result of the GST, because this is all critical to the statements of the Prime Minister, of the Treasurer and indeed of Senator Kemp that prices `need not rise'. They are going to go up by at least 2c a litre as a result of the GST. There is no doubt about that. The government might like to address its mind to that and whether or not it is going to take any action in terms of delivering its promiseâthat is, the promise given from 1998 that petrol prices will not go up as a result of the GST. That is the challenge for the government. It is a challenge for the government to come in here, to explain this process, to make sure that people understand it and to make sure that it can carry out its commitments.

As has been explained by my colleagues, the coalition went to the last election saying that people who lived in what might be regional and rural Australiaâor in what is now being defined in this legislation as non-metropolitan and remote Australiaâwould not be any worse off because of the introduction of the GST. However, from the points that have been put forward in the debate so far, people in regional and rural Australia know that they will be worse off under the GST. As Senator Murphy has so eloquently explained, the coalition spokesmen, from the Prime Minister through the Treasurer to the Assistant Treasurer, in one form or another said that petrol prices in regional and rural Australia would not be any worse after the introduction of the GST. As a result of their actions, they have tried to work out some sort of scheme which they hope will be a sop to country Australia. They hope that they will get themselves off the hook as a result of the introduction of this scheme.</para></talk.start><para>As my colleagues have already explained, there are a number of deficiencies in this scheme on which we have sought informationâquestions we would like to see answered in the minister's reply. In particular there is the term `non-metropolitan and remote areas in Australia'; however, as far as I can see from the legislation, there is no definition of that. We had this problem with the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme as well. Fortunately, we now do have maps that determine what are the metropolitan and non-metropolitan parts of Australia. As has also been explained by my colleagues, they seem to be very much drawn up in terms of what might be marginal seats and the impact on those marginal seats in regional and rural Australia.</para><para>One of the difficulties still outstanding in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is the definition of `a journey'. The industry, the Taxation Office and the department of transport are still involved in determinations of what might be the definition of a journey because of the hotchpotch scheme that the government has introduced. As we have explained ad nauseam, if vehicles less than 20 tonnes leave a metropolitan area, go into a metropolitan area, make deliveries and then return to that metropolitan area, we have not been able to get succinct answers as to where and when the rebate will apply for that particular type of vehicle. Similarly, we are not sure whether a vehicle that comes from a non-metropolitan area, makes deliveries into a metropolitan area, picks up again in that metropolitan area and then proceeds to return to a non-metropolitan area in whatever time may be determined is eligible. We are not sure whether the journey is defined on a daily basis or by the time the vehicle returns to the non-metropolitan area.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âBlame the Democrats.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âI am afraid you are in government, Senator McGauran.

I will bet London to a brick on this one that shortly you will be advised that those prices will not be able to come down because, with any particular item, road transport costsâand I am only talking about road transport costsârepresent anywhere between 27 per cent and 30 per cent of the cost of the item. It is a big gamble on the part of the government to think that there will be an impact on goods and services as a result of the introduction of this diesel fuel rebate, because I do not think there will be. I think you will find that the impact of that will be well and truly seen in terms of the consumer price index. Here we are, once again, dividing up our own land in terms of people having access to rebates or taxation exemptions, and we are leaving other parts of our country suffering through having to wear that additional taxation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We do not have a copy of the definition of what non-metropolitan and remote areas might be, but if you look at the guide of what the government did in terms of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, you can see that it is more attuned to the government's marginal seats campaign than anything to do with good economics. I will just point out one area. As I outlined during the debate on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, we looked at towns just in this vicinity. Vehicles that are less than 20 tonnes and over four tonnes in the Canberra region are not eligible for the rebate. If you go to Queanbeyan, in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, you are eligible for the rebate. Howeverâand I am not sure how we will define thisâif you are a service station in Fyshwick maybe you will not be eligible for the petrol rebate. I wonder, if you are a petrol station in Queanbeyan, whether you will be eligible for this rebate.</para><para>Currently, if you drive down the road here to the Shell service station at Fyshwick, for leaded fuel you will pay 94.9c a litre and for unleaded fuel you will pay 91.9c. If you go across the border to the Mobil at Queanbeyan, which one of my staff was able to do this morning, you will find that leaded fuel costs 94.9c and unleaded fuel costs 91.9c. They are similar prices. However, under the determination of the government in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, you will find that Queanbeyan, in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, may be defined as non-metropolitan or remote. I do not know whether we could define it as remote, but it may be defined as non-metropolitan. I wonder how the service stations are going to react in Canberra when there is an incentive, if a city like Queanbeyan is to be defined as non-metropolitan, of maybe up to 6c or 7c a litre in rebate available to that region. What will the service stations in Canberra be doing? I will tell you what they will be doing: they will be closing down.</para><para>As the government should know, a number of road transport operators have said that they are going to move their base out of Fyshwick and into the non-metropolitan region of Queanbeyan, which seems to me just an extension of the industrial belt of Canberra. So you could have an adverse impact unless we see what is defined as non-metropolitan or remote areas in determination of this scheme.</para><para>We have seen in the legislation that it is going to cost about $500 million over four years, and it has come out in estimates that the implementation and setting up of this schemeâand the tax office has admitted thisâis going to cost the tax office $19.6 million. So all around this hotchpotch of a goods and services tax is starting to cost a lot of money for Australians. We will wait with bated breath to see what the benefits will be, but I can tell you that they will not be much. Let us look at the implementation of this schemeâand let us say that we are looking at a figure of 6c or 7c a litre being discounted. Petrol prices in Liverpool in New South Wales have often been used for comparison, and currently unleaded fuel is worth 86.9c and leaded is 89.9c. In what may be termed `remote' Australia, at the Wilcannia service station in remote New South Wales unleaded fuel is 102.9c and leaded is 103.9c. If you go to Goulburn up the road from here, unleaded fuel is 89.9c and leaded is 92.9c. Let us say we take 7c a litre away from each of those prices and then add the GST. Currently, the Wilcannia unleaded is 102.9c. With the rebate of 7c and then adding the GST, that goes up to 105c. So the price is increased by about 2.6c a litre. The leaded fuelâwhich I would imagine a lot of people in regional and rural Australia are still usingâwill go from 103.9c to 106c a litre. Big deal! They must be bringing home the bacon with those increases in the fuel price. </para><para>If some of the National Party senators moved out of their inner-city abodes, whether in Sydney or Melbourne, they might find that rural and regional people use a lot more fuelâpetrol or dieselâthan any other Australians. It is going to be a significant impost on them. With a vehicle that might take 60 litres when filled upâand they are going to do that at least three times a weekâthey are looking at paying at least another $10 or $12 a week to keep doing what they are doing now. And, as we have identified in a number of reports over the last few years, the level of incomes in regional and rural Australia is not as significant as it is in the metropolitan areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âMr Costello wants to lower it even more.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âOf course he does.

The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in its present form, subject to various amendments, was brought in by the Fraser government in the early 1980s. About every two or three years when it was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office, irrespective of who was in government, what did the Auditor-General consistently find? He found that no minister, no government, could guarantee that the money paid out under the fuel rebate scheme was meeting the policy objectives of the scheme. It was impossible to guaranteeâit was running at something like $1.5 billionâthat the money was going to be spent the way the policy intended. It was impossible to guarantee that the diesel fuel provided for non-off road use was being used for off-road use. That consistently was the Auditor-General's comment. He was saying that the government is appropriating money for the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme but in the administration of it, because of the nature of the scheme, you cannot guarantee that the will of the parliament in appropriating the money is being met. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I put some amendments through to tighten up some aspects of the scheme and was roundly condemned by the Liberal Party as being too tough. Within a short period of the coalition being in government you also were moving to tighten up the loopholes, as commented on by the Auditor-General. You did it to try and save money; we tried to do it to save the taxpayers money and properly administer it. </para><para>This scheme makes the diesel fuel rebate scheme seem like an absolute model of detail, an example that we should all hold up of how to do it. That is in comparison to what you are outlining in this bill, where the regulations are unknown, there is no time scale about the preparation, and the second reading speech I have just exposed as a one-page nonsense. The second reading speech for the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Bill is six sentences long, with five dot points. For a $125 million a year expenditure that is the best you can do? The second reading speech for the third bill, the Fuel Sales Grants (Consequential Amendments) Bill, is a classicâfive sentences; six, if you include `I commend the bill'. You are saying to the Senate and in public administration terms that this proposal to expend an expected $500 million over four years can be explained in those three second reading speeches. Consider all the evidence before the government, before the treasury department and before the taxation department, from the people who have administered the diesel fuel rebate, which you took from Customs into Taxation, go and speak to any of those people who have had experience with the diesel fuel rebate, and they will know that this scheme is wide open to rorting.  </para><para>Some of the rorting will be by accident because I suspect many of the small businesses will not be able to meet the compliance arrangements or will misunderstand the compliance arrangements. The next thing is that the taxation department will be going around trying to penalise those small businesses. There will be screams all over the bush. Senator McGauran might say, `Blame the Democrats' but they will have to blame the government because the government is implementing it. Then there will be moves to reduce the penalties, to loosen the compliance, to meet the political problem of the National Party and rural Liberal members. As soon as you make it any looser, more of the money will disappear and not meet the objective. You will not know where the money is going. You will not know whether the supposed policy objective, which you outlined in a couple of lines, is being met. </para><para>Then the Auditor-General will do his or her first report. It will be a classic report which we will have great fun with if we are still in opposition. If we are in government we will have to work out how to deal with the Auditor-General's report, how to deal with this terrible, badly thought out scheme. The Auditor-General's first report, I safely predict now, will be an outstanding piece of criticism of this scheme. Treasury and Taxation officials will squirm at estimates as they try to explain how the scheme went wrong, how they cannot trace the money, how people got away with it and how they then chased down a few unfortunate small business people who did not know how to administer it. In the end, the Treasurer's promiseâthat petrol prices in regional Australia will not be any higher than before the introduction of the GSTâwill still not be guaranteed. But in the meantime you may well have wasted in four years $500 million. </para><para>So, Minister, I look forward to hearing some explanations. I would like to know how the round figure of $500 million was reached. Will Treasury be honest and say they have no idea about it? It is such a round figure. You would have thought Treasury might have disguised it a bit and told the minister: `We will make it $531 million, or $498 million.' This is another sign that Treasury believes this is a stupid schemeâsaying to the minister: `It will cost about $500 million', a rounded out figure. Treasury has made no attempt to put to the minister and to the government any reasonable, rational reasons for this scheme. They have left the government with the most minimum explanation, which exposes the fact that this scheme will not work. It is an embarrassment to the officers concerned that they have been forced to do it. When you read the second reading speeches you know that. Anyone who has had any experience dealing with Treasury will know that they know how to skin a cat over in Treasuryâto do a minister in, in their own subtle way. This ain't very subtle, of course. They are doing the minister and the government in in a very big, unsubtle way, saying: `Treasurer, you are on your own about this. We don't want much to do with it.' So I support the amendment moved by Senator Cook. I look forward to the explanation by the government. Above all else, I look forward to the first Auditor's report on this scheme, when he absolutely puts it to the sword. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKiernan</name></talker><para>âRepeat it. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âI will repeat it.

The government is reducing the excise to ensure that the pump price need not rise. And we need to understand that for business this represents a fuel cost reduction, which is quite contrary to the impression that some members of the Labor Party may have given in their remarks. For business this represents a fuel cost reduction, given, of course, that businesses can claim an input tax credit in respect of the GST paid on petrol and diesel used for business purposes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, established under these bills, addresses the fact that the excise reduction would need to be greater in rural and regional areas in order to offset the effect of the GST. For constitutional reasons, excise rates must be common across the Commonwealth, and for that reason additional assistance to rural and regional Australia will be provided by way of a grant. The grant will be paid at the retail stage, typically to service stations and other retail outlets. In that sense, this scheme differs from schemes operated by various states and territories which have paid subsidies to oil companies and distributors in an attempt to reduce the pump price of petrol and diesel.  </para><para>The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will be prescribed under the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's price exploitation legislation. The ACCC already have in place a system for monitoring fuel prices and will use this as a basis for monitoring the impact of the scheme. The amendments moved by the government today will ensure that the ACCC are empowered to receive information as to the recipients of grants under this scheme, which will assist the ACCC in their price monitoring efforts. We appreciate that the non-government parties will be supporting that amendment. The government are always proud to assist rural and regional Australiaâindeed, all Australians. Quite contrary to the impression that Senator Schacht attempted to create, this is a very important bill; it is good legislation; and it shows the government's commitment to motorists and businesses in rural and remote Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âIt is not what Treasury says.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âThe interjection of Senator Schacht reminded me that there was an unfortunate attack on officers of the Treasury.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âNo. It was said in a rather facetious and unpleasant manner.

The ACCC will assess whether the grant is passed on by using the net dollar margin rule. The amendment that I will be moving today clarifies that the ATO can pass relevant information on grant recipients to the ACCC so that they can actively monitor the impact of the grant. Let me say, in conclusion to Senator Ridgeway's comments, the ACCC has been monitoring fuel prices across the country and has considerable data to assist in price monitoring.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, we welcome the support that the bill will receive in the chamber, although we do not welcome the accompanying comments that many Labor senators have indulged themselves inâdespite all the information which has already been put out on the table. The government has said that, with the introduction of the GST, the government will reduce excise on petrol and diesel so that the pump prices of these commodities need not rise. I reiterate that for businesses, fuel costs will fall substantially under tax reform, due to the availability of, among other things, the GST input tax credit and the expansion of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In fact, under the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme, the cost of diesel in eligible vehicles will be reduced by some 24c per litre. I would have thought that all of us would have strongly welcomed that measure and the commitment that the government has made to attempting to cut costs to business, particularly in rural and regional Australia. This is a substantial effective reduction in excise.</para><para>I listened, as I always do, very carefully to what Labor senators said and I checked with my advisers as to whether anyoneâincluding Senator Sherry, who often speaks for Labor on tax policy; which we appreciateâhad given any assurances that the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme would continue under any alternative government. I was a bit surprised that that commitment was not given, because this is providing a huge effective cut in diesel fuel prices. I give some notice that I shall be pursuing that guarantee in the debates, not only today but in future debate in this chamber. I put that on notice. As I said, we will not be supporting the second reading amendment by Senator Cook.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cook's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

What will be the rate applying to unleaded petrol for the remainder of the year?

I have to make the people of Tasmania aware of this. It is a very important issue.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>14953</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have responded to that question in some detail, and I refer you to my earlier remarks.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>14953</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of that answer, I have got a question too.

The government has put in place arrangements to ensure that petrol prices need not rise as a result of the GST. In fact, for business users petrol prices will be cut because they are able to claim an input tax credit. This is a very effective benefit for business users. The purpose of this grant scheme is to prevent the differential rising, and this grant scheme will be very effective.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14954</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, in response to my question about the monitoring in the lead-up, you said this was gone over in great detail in the estimates.

He asked the question about the Treasurer's powers which are referred to in the bill, he was given a response and I assume he was satisfied with that.

In doing so, it is important to very briefly put on the record the history of this legislation. The impact of this bill will be to remove a two-year sunset clause, which expires at the end of June this year, from the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act was a piece of legislation that replaced a number of previous acts, including the Live-stock Transactions Levy Act, which was passed by this parliament back in 1997. </para></talk.start><para>Honourable senators will recallâI hope they do, taking a deep interest in rural matters as we all shouldâthat a package of some 17 bills was dealt with back in December 1997. Those bills related to the restructure and reform of the levy collection system within the meat and livestock industry. At that time, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee handed down a report on one of those bills, the Live-stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997. The unanimous recommendation of the committee at that time was that that particular bill be withdrawn and that a roundtable of negotiations take place between the various interest groups within the industryâthose from the Sheepmeat Council, those from the Council of Livestock Agents and a range of other groups. The reason for that was that there were various differences of opinion as to how the levy should be structured and how it should be calculated. Some believed that it should be calculated on a per head basis, others believed that it should be an ad valorem system and others thought it should be a mixture of both.</para><para>As I said, at the time, the committee unanimously recommended that the bill be withdrawn and that industry be consulted so as to hopefully come up with an agreed position. However, despite the differences within the industry, the overwhelming view of those in the industry was that they wanted the legislation passed at that time in its then form and that they would continue to see how the system worked. Because it was a money bill, the opposition put forward the proposition that a two-year sunset clause be inserted into the legislation. That sunset clause would expire at the end of June 2000. The purpose of that was to enable the system of levy collections to operate during the intervening period. The parties would be able to monitor how it worked and whether or not it was successful, and then there would be a specific requirement upon the government to come back into the parliament with further legislation to amend the bill, to implement another system of collection if that was what the industry desired or to review the sunset clause. We are advised that the industry has monitored the system and that it has agreed that it would be appropriate to continue with the current method. Accordingly, we need to remove the sunset clause from the legislation. That is the purpose of this bill, and on that basis we are happy to support it.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to put on the record that it was an opposition initiative that this process occur. We are very pleased to be able to say that it was picked up by the government and agreed to. It has resulted in a situation where the industry has had the opportunity to assess the system of levy collections and has been able to come to a unified position. So we support the legislation that is before the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>14956</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe reasons for the necessity of this bill have been provided in the second reading speech of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on 13 April. It is quite critical for the sunset clause in schedule 18 of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 to be repealed so that levy arrangements can continue for the sheep, lamb and goat industries. We need to enact this bill by 30 June this year. I welcome the support of the opposition for this very important amendment, and I am very pleased that it has had unopposed progress through the House and the Senate. All the issues which were raised on the original consideration have been addressed in the Sheepmeat Council report, and the Wool Council had no objections. It must be very gratifying for members of these industries to see that they are doing reasonably well at the moment. In the case of the lamb industry, this has been in spite of a hefty US tariff rate quota regime that commenced in July last year. In the case of the sheepmeat industry, I am pleased to report that livestock exports have resumed to Saudi Arabia, which was our largest live sheep market in the 1980s. </para></talk.start><para>The sheep, lamb and goat industries are very important to the economic health of many parts of rural and regional Australia. It follows that those industries should be provided with every opportunity for further improving and developing their opportunities.

The enactment of this bill will ensure the orderly continuation of each of those elements, thus allowing the sheep, lamb and goat industries to attain the full extent of their potential.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>POOLED DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14957</page.no><id.no>R948</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>14957</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>14957</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly, the opposition agrees that this bill is non-controversial legislation.

Australia has great heroes, both in the armed forces and in civilian life, and we are entitled to be proud of them. Among those who have been at the forefront of producing heroes in civil life are the firefighters. They have fought fires, both in the cities and in the bush. What I am going to say is in the context of Victoria, but I think we pay tribute as a parliament to firefighters throughout Australia. There have been some dramatic fires that have occurred in Victoria. There was the fire known as Black Thursday, which took place in February 1851 and about which Manning Clarke wrote with great eloquence, as he was able to do generally. His prose persists forever. There was Black Friday in January 1939, which I remember. That dates me. One which I remember very well was Ash Wednesday in February 1983, which caused great damage to, amongst other places, Anglesea, a place where I go often, particularly at Christmas time. I think it produced the highest number of fatalities of any fire in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>There was another fire that took place on 2 December 1998 near Linton, which is a town in Victoria near Geelong. On that occasion there were five men who went from Geelong to fight that fire at Linton, in the tradition of the firefighters who fought these other fires I have talked about. They did what many Victorians had done prior to them in Victoria and what many Australians had done in Australia prior to that. Unfortunately, those people were caught in the fire and perished most tragically near Linton. I am sure the parliamentary secretary, Senator Patterson, who is present in the chamber and is also a Victorian, will join me in saying, as will everybody here, that these were great men. The firefighters were: Gary Vredeveldt, who was aged 47; Jason Thomas, aged 25; Stuart Davidson, aged 28; Chris Evans, aged 27; and a young man of 17, Matthew Armstrong. These were people who carried on the proud line of firefighters we have had in Victoria and elsewhere. I want to acknowledge their great deeds today and to express the great sympathy that their families and the other people associated with them are properly entitled to.  </para><para>What has this to do with the bill? It has this to do with the billâand I thank Mr Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio, for drawing this to my attention; he has said much about this in the other place from time to time. Following that tragedy, a trust was set up and people who were sympathetic to what had happened contributed to it. The contributions that were made to the trust were substantial. At that time, this government said, `Yes, contributions to this trust will be tax deductable.' That tax deductibility is provided for in this bill that is before the chamber now. I do not want to be partisan about this or unduly critical, because we do not use occasions such as this to be critical. I am told by Mr O'Connor that it would have helped if this provision had been brought in earlier and it may have made things a lot easier than they have been. I simply put that forward.</para><para>It may be a thing for all of us to remember, whether we are in government or in oppositionâand it is something for the Labor Party to remember when it comes into governmentâthat, although in the overall view of things a trust fund is not a great issue in terms of the economy, or in terms of fiscal policy, this trust fund represents a proper outflow of compassion from the community to people who have been caught in tragic circumstances. We as a parliament ought to remember that those issues of the heart and the soul are issues that ought to call for a response from this parliament to accommodate them. In other words, it should be not only fiscal and monetary policy that guides us but also matters of compassion. This may well have been an example where the parliament could have passed the legislation that is contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999 earlier than, in fact, we have in this place.</para><para>No doubt the parliamentary secretary who is in this place at the moment and who is also a Victorian would agree with what I say. I am glad to have had the opportunity to have mentioned this tragic event. No doubt bushfires will occur in the magnificent state of Victoria in the future, but it is always worth while remembering the people who fight them, and fight them with such gallantry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>14958</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999 makes amendments to the income tax law and to other laws to give effect to a number of measures: restructuring of certain managed investment schemes, film licensed investment companies, Cyclones Elaine and Vance Trust Account, mining and quarrying balancing adjustments, and transfer of interest in petroleum products. </para></talk.start><para>As Senator Cooney has pointed out, there is also provision here for the tax deductibility of the Linton Trust Fund. As Senator Cooney mentioned, it is important for my state of Victoria, particularly the people of the Geelong region, because it will allow deductions for gifts made to the Linton Trust. As Senator Cooney mentioned, it was established to provide assistance to the families of the five firefighters: Third Lieutenant Stuart Davidson; Firefighter Gary Vredeveldt; Firefighter Jason Thomas; Firefighter Matthew Armstrongâand Senator Cooney mentioned that he was only 17 but he was actually on his first firefighting effort; and a third generation firefighter, Chris Evans. </para><para>Just after the tragedy I actually spoke very briefly on the adjournment debate to convey condolences on behalf of the chamber to the families of those firefighters of the Geelong West Urban Fire Brigade and also to mention that Andrew Joyce, one of my staff members, who is in the chamber as my adviser today, trained with three of those young men and was a member of the Geelong West Urban Fire Brigade. We forget not only the families of those people who were so tragically taken but also those people who have worked with them, who have grown up with them, who have trained with them and also those who lose best mates as a result. It has an impact not just on family but also on friends and the whole firefighting community.</para><para>I know personally just what it meant to Andrew when those five men died. He now is an active member of the fire brigade here in the ACT. They give up enormous amounts of time. They go out in the middle of the night; they risk their lives and sometimes their lives are taken in ensuring safety for the community. We do have to respect and value what the volunteer firefighters throughout Australia have done. We have just had a minor amendment made in one of the taxation laws on the diesel fuel rebate as a result of Andrew Joyce pointing out to us some of the issues that might occur with refuelling fire tankers. So it pays to have people on one's staff who have had wide community experience because they can bring their knowledge to the policy process.</para><para>As Senator Cooney said, these men were taken from us tragically. The Linton Trust was established to provide assistance to the families of the five firefighters who died fighting bushfires in Victoria on 2 December 1998. Senator Cooney pointed out that it has taken some time. One of the problems is that, when an event such as this occurs, people are moved to be very generous. Sometimes they set up a trust and then the legislation has to follow. Of course, at the moment we are involved in some of the largest taxation changes in Australia's history. That has probably meant that this legislation has been delayed more than it ought to have been. There is a problem when a trust is set up for a special purpose in that it has to be legislated for. Despite the very best intentions of those people, sometimes they get ahead of the process. This legislation will mean that gifts made to the trust after 2 December 1998 and before 3 December 2000 will be deductable. I would like to commend the efforts of my colleagues in the Senate. Senator Cooney has mentioned his colleague. The member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, in the other House also has a keen interest in seeing this aspect of the bill pass through both houses as speedily as possible.</para><para>The amendments will also be made to extend, for a period of four months, the time in which donations to the National Nurses' Memorial Trust will be tax deductable. An extension of time has been granted to the trust so that it can raise additional funds for the construction of the memorial. In addition, the amendments will give tax exempt status to non-profit organisations which promote the development of fishing and/or aquaculture resources. The income tax law grants income tax exempt status to non-profit organisations that promote the development of a number of primary and secondary industries. The government believes that fishing and/or aquaculture organisations should receive the same taxation concessions, and the exemptions will apply for 1999-2000 and later years of income. Even in what might have been a dry old tax bill, we still see a part of the social fabric of Australia in the incredible voluntary contribution that people make in Australia, particularly in emergency services. I commend the bill to the house.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.11 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>14959</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14959</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Richard (Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI inform the Senate that Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister representing the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation will be absent from the Senate today.

Can he explain why the Minister for Aged Care has not even bothered to respond to three requests from the ANF calling on the Commonwealth to take some responsibility for those employees' entitlements? Now that media attention has shifted from Riverside, is the government hoping that the 78 employees will simply go away? Don't the former staff of Riverside deserve much better, particularly since some of them were responsible for reporting the poor care and the kerosene bath incident to the appropriate authorities?

Suitable places are being located for the remaining two residents who had been shifted to St Vincents.

As usual, Senator McGauran focuses on the key issues. The key issue which concerns many Australians is the level of unemployment and what the government is doing to achieve its goal of bringing this level down. Nothing highlights the improved performance of the Australian economy under the Howard government than the unemployment rate that was announced today. The unemployment rate for May was 6.7 per cent, a fall of 0.1 per cent on the April figure. It is very encouraging to note that the unemployment rate is at its lowest level for almost a decade. This is a very significant reduction from the 8.5 per cent rate we inherited from the Labor government. The record for Labor was a very bad record. Unemployment reached 11.5 per cent under Labor.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âWho was the minister?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âLet me contrast this with the figure today of 6.7 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âWho was the minister?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âI will take that particular comment of Senator Abetz. I think I am correct in saying that Mr Beazley had a very important role in the Keating government when unemployment rose to 11.5 per cent. It is great news that some 600,000 new jobs have been created under the coalition government. The employment figures rose by over 12,000 in May to be 3.4 per cent higher than a year earlier. This latest figure is in keeping with the almost four per cent increase in the ANZ job advertisements series of May, which was released on Monday. The dramatic increase in the number of Australians with jobs has been a tremendous outcome for Australian families, especially when it happened in conjunction with an increase in rural wages.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>However, the government is very much aware there is still more work to be done. This is why the Howard government remains committed to major reforms of the Australian economy to create a more competitive and more prosperous economyâreforms which will provide real benefits for Australian families. On 1 July, Australians will receive the largest tax cut in Australian history. These tax cuts are worth around $12 billion a year and will provide to many Australian families an effective tax cut of $40 to $50 per week.

There is no doubt that the reforms will be an enormous boost to the economy. It is a bit surprising that the Queensland Premier, Mr Peter Beattie, has stated today that his government will not achieve its unemployment target of five per cent because of the GST. The reality is that the unemployment levels in Queensland are entirely of Mr Beattie's own making. While the national rate is now at 6.7 per cent, the Queensland unemployment rate is 7.7 per cent, well above the national average. Perhaps the Beattie government may care to rethink its pro-union industrial policies, instead of casting around for false excuses for ditching its five per cent promise.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Public Relations Campaign</title><page.no>14962</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>14962</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

Australia does need a new research reactor. Our existing reactor continues to be safe, but it is 42 years old and it is technologically obsolete. Having a new reactor will benefit Australia in many ways. This reactor produces radioisotopes which are used for medical diagnosis and treatment for 320,000 Australians every year. Radioisotopes are used by industry for safety monitoring and environmental management. The reactor is also a very significant piece of scientific infrastructure. That is why there are over 200 research reactors in dozens of countries around the world. </para></talk.start><para>Our government decided in 1997 that we would replace the Lucas Heights reactor and after a very rigorous tender process I announced on Tuesday that the government had selected the Argentinian company Invap in a joint venture alliance with Australian firms John Holland Constructions and Evans Deakin Industries to design and construct the new reactor at Lucas Heights. The negative reaction of the ALP and, in particular, Senator Bolkus to this announcement has been absolutely hypocritical. The ALP clearly supports having a new reactor. The Public Works Committee in its report last year unanimously supported having a new reactor. There were four Labor signatories to that report: Janice Crosio, Collin Hollis, Bernie Ripoll and, of course, Senator Shayne Murphy. That Public Works Committee report concluded: </para><quote><para>A need exists to replace the HIFAR reactor with a modern research reactor. The need for a replacement reactor arises as a consequence of national interest considerations, R&amp;D requirements and the need to sustain the local production of radio-pharmaceuticals.</para></quote><para>Of course, the ALP has also opportunistically criticised the location of the reactor at Lucas Heights. But the Labor members of the committee, as well as the whole committee, said:</para><quote><para>On financial grounds there is merit in locating the replacement reactor at Lucas Heights, subject to the suitability of the site on operational and public safety grounds.</para></quote><para>Of course, the ALP in the House of Representatives voted to adopt this Public Works Committee report. The ALP knows, as we do, that the cost of replacing the reactor would probably double to some $600 million if it was moved out of Lucas Heights to some remote location. Of course, there are no safety concerns with keeping the reactor at Lucas Heights, as Gareth Evans infamously admitted in that extraordinary letter of May 1998 to Helen Garnett at ANSTO, in which he said on the new reactor: </para><quote><para>I am afraid that the realities of politics in an election year, and, in particular, our need to win Hughesâ</para></quote><para>which they failed miserably to doâ</para><quote><para>have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor at the Lucas Heights site, as difficult as that may be to justify in objective, safety-focussed terms.</para></quote><para>That is the most honest thing Gareth Evans ever said in his political life. The duplicity of the ALP on this issue is an absolute disgrace. The ALP know we have to have a new reactor; they know it should be at Lucas Heights and that we need this for our scientific infrastructure.

In the last nine years, there have been a number of agencies that have been provided electronic information from the AEC. I cite them: Social Security, Centrelink, Defence, Australian Customs Service, NCA, Australian Taxation Office, DETYA, ComSuper, Passports, ASIC and DEWRSB. That was provided to those agencies on the basis of legal advice that was obtained back when Labor was in power and when Senator Bolkus was minister for the AEC and when Mr McMullan in the other place, the member for Canberra, was the minister who had responsibility. This has been a view held over the last nine years, substantiated by a consistent line of advice, and the AEC has acted on that legal advice.  </para><para>What I have said is that the AEC has acted in accordance with the legal advice and had done nothing otherwise than in accordance with that legal advice.

In fact, this was acknowledged by the New South Wales Auditor-General at that time, in his report to parliament prior to the sale, where he concluded that the sale proceeds were `fair and reasonable and entirely acceptable'. The Auditor-General also found that the consideration to be received by the state `clearly exceeds the financial and economic return that the state would obtain if it remained the owner of the State Bank'. I am advised by the minister for finance that he has only one regret in relation to the sale of the State Bank of New South Wales: that it did not happen five years earlier, when the Greiner government tried to sell it but the sale was stopped in the Legislative Council in New South Wales. </para></talk.start><para>There have been other comments made which are worth while to note, in relation to the sale of Telstra 1.

The issue price for Telstra 1 was determined on the basis of advice received from the joint global coordinators to the sale and confirmed by the government's independent business adviser, BZW. The issue price was also consistent with the bids lodged in the book build by the upper end of the range of the majority of market valuations of Telstra undertaken by the world's leading analystsânot only those employed by the selling syndicate.

I ask the opposition: are you going to join the government in remedying the flaw, which we have to address and the Attorney-General says we have to address, that existed when you were in government? When Senator Bolkus was the minister administering the AEC, the same flaw existed. He had the same legal advice. He has gone very quiet.

It is a great package for those industries, and because of that it is great for rural and regional Australia.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Ecstasy</title><page.no>14973</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>14973</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjectingâ</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>86Y</name.id><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name></talker><para>âUnlike the questions from across the chamber, my question is a serious one seeking real information.

It is a most appropriate question. I can understand why the Labor Party does not want to listen to the answer. In the first 10 months of this financial year, Customs, at the border, have seized 126 kilos of ecstasy, including, I might say, the largest seizure we have ever hadâ76 kilos in Brisbane. You might ask, Madam President: how does that compare with past years? It is about 40 per cent up on last year. You might ask: how has the government as a whole gone? What has happened since you guys came to office? Are youâthe Liberal and National governmentâdoing better than the Labor Party? So I thought I had better make some inquiries. We have added up the ecstasy seizures in the first five years of this governmentâwell, the first four years and 10 monthsâand the figure comes to 348.4 kilos. I thought that sounded pretty good, so let us have a look at what happened in the last five years under Labor, when Senator Bolkus and others had some responsibility for this. In our first five years, remember, it was 348 kilos; in the last five years of Labor, 28.2 kilos. So if that does not tell the whole world that the Labor Party was and still is soft on drugs! It did not give a damn about drugs coming over the border, did not care what the drugs did to young Australiansâ28.2 kilos in five years at the border.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjectingâ</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name></talker><para>âSo 28.2 was all you could do.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator Lees</name></talker><para>âThe drug wasn't an issue then.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I do not think the Campbells and the Macdonalds mix very well. I want to outline the events that took place yesterday in respect of an email. The ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, spoke to me by phone yesterday morning and advised me that she had forwarded to me an email at 6.36 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 June, which I did not receive. Subsequent to the discussion over the telephone, she sent me a repeat of that email at 10.07 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 June, which I did receive. During question time yesterday, Senator Alston quoted from that email in response to a question without notice from a government senator. It would appear that the original email intended for me was misdirected. To my knowledge, no attempt was made to redirect the original email to me, and I make the point that no attempt was made by Senator Ian Campbell from that time up until 2.32 p.m. today to forward that email on. I have subsequently found that the email was originally sent at 6.36 p.m. on Tuesday. It was addressed to senator.campbell@aph.gov.au, which I understand to be Senator Ian Campbell's email address.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would also like to point out that from time to time I have received by mistake physical mail addressed to Senator Ian Campbell. I always have forwarded, and will continue to forward, that mail to Senator Ian Campbell and would not intentionally read it or disclose its contents to others. I think that is a responsible, commonsense approach to misdirected mail. I wonder, however, what Senator Ian Campbell's response would be if I retained that mail, opened it and used it in the way in which my email was used for political purposes. The event raises a number of questions. For example, what is the difference between physical mail and email? I believe that there is no difference, that they are exactly the same and that they should be treated the same. Senator Ian Campbell, I would remind the parliament, is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, and is Manager of Government Business in the Senate.

That was opened; it was actually my wife who picked up the fact that it was not my bill. It was for room service provisions of alcohol at prices that I prefer not to pay.

The email system in my Perth office received the email at a time when I was not even in the building. Quite honestly, the first time I knew that the email had been received was when I arrived in question time about half an hour late because of the fog that enshrouded our capital yesterday. Senator George Campbell raised the issue with me in a heated wayâa way I would expectâand quite rightly so. He had a reason to be angry about it.

Senator George Campbell will attest to the fact that an email that was received last night was forwarded to him. In fact, I gave instructions to my Perth office last night to make sure that all emails were forwarded on, including the one that was received last night. That did not occur until 2.30 p.m. because my office staff in Perth were delayed in getting into the office this morning and did so at the earliest occasion on my specific instruction. I want to make that clear.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other point that needs to be madeâbecause there is a serious issue hereâis that one of the messages I received for Senator George Campbell was a message that had an email cover and an attached document, which is the way that you can effectively protect documents, but the email that was received yesterday in my absence was an email that had the message on the cover note. There is no way that you can avoid seeing the message, especially if it is addressed to Senator Campbell. Clearly, if you go to the end of the email and see that the sender is Sharan Burrow, then you might presume that it was not meant to be sent to me. But one of the messages that Sharan Burrow sent out was addressed to a whole range of senatorsâI think it was a lobbying effort. I do not claim that in relation to yesterday's email. But when there are messages from the ACTU President directed to a whole range of senators, it is quite possible for you to be confused as to whether you are the genuine recipient. One of the suggestions I might make, which I have thought about overnight on this issue, is that since there is now a Senator George Campbell and a Senator Ian Campbell, rather than my address being `senator.campbell' it should be changed to `senator.ian.campbell', which would make it a lot easier. I intend making that suggestion to whoever in this place creates those email addresses. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>14978</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Information Mail-Out</title><page.no>14978</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>14978</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ray today, relating to the provision of electoral roll details to the Australian tax Office.</para></motion><para>This morning at 9 o'clock, Slater and Gordon, Sydney, delivered on behalf of Senator Faulkner and me letters of demand on both the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the Australian Electoral Commissioner demanding that they desist from their planned mail-out using the electronic mail list supplied by the AEC to all Australian electors.

The reason why you always stuck to that story was that there was no end use attached to 91(10). Now you are shifting your ground.

Eventually, again as a new process, the tax office can get that particular information under (4A)(e), but the problem is that the whole of 91A comes in, which restricts its use. It does not mention 91(10). You are shifting your ground from time to time, but you are not going to get away with it. You applied for it under 91(10); you did not apply for it under 91(4A)(e). For that reason, a whole series of illegal acts has occurred. If we had not raised these issues at estimates, this process would never have been turned up and previous flaws would not have been exposed. I reckon, Senator Ellison, you should cough up for the amount of money we have had to pay for legal adviceâit is not muchâbecause we have saved you a massive amount of money by raising these issues and helping you to avoid having to go to the Federal Court and lose. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>14979</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSince as early as 1991, the Australian Electoral Commission has acted on consistent advice that it was able to provide information in electronic form. That advice was not just sought on section 91(10), it was given pursuant to a request as to whether we were able to do this under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. That advice was recently confirmed by the Australian Government Solicitor and was obtained after the recent estimates. The Electoral Commissioner was doing his duty in checking on the allegations that had been raised. He was doing his job in checking that and the advice was confirmed. At that point there had been a long line of advice which had said that, under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, they were able to do this.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bolkus, who as a previous minister presided over the AEC, was of the same understanding. Mr McMullan, the member for Fraser, presided over the AEC and was of exactly the same understanding. There are even examples of a number of agencies receiving electronic information from the AEC: Social Security, Centrelink, Defence, Australian Customs Service, NCA, ATO, DETYA, ComSuper, the passport section of DFAT, ASIC and DEWRSB. The government took the responsible action of taking advice from the Solicitor-General. That was done yesterday, before any letter from Slater and Gordon. When you look at the letter from Slater and Gordon and the advice from the Victorian government, they said that the AEC could not provide this electronic information to a prescribed authority under the act. When you look at the Solicitor-General's advice, he says that the AEC can. What he points to is a flaw in what you can do with the information once you have received it. What we are going to have to look at, and what the AEC has said it will look at, is a regulation or amendment of the legislation so that the agencies concerned can then do what they are supposed to do for the Australian people; that is, provide services and use this information to that end. But at the moment, because of the advice we have had from the Solicitor-General, that will have to be remedied. I ask the opposition whether they are willing to remedy this longstanding flaw which existed when they were in government. It existed from about 1991. Since then, advice consistently has said that information could be provided in the electronic format.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âWhy don't you just apologise.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>âWe have to remedy this defect.

There is now an acknowledgment that the Prime Minister's GST mail-out to Australian voters was illegal. That is the point. Today the government has acknowledged that what Labor senatorsâSenator Ray and Iâhave been saying now for a couple of weeks is correct. The Prime Minister's GST mail-out to voters was illegal, as we have said since 24 May. It puts paid to what Minister Ellison said in his press statement of 25 May, and I quote him:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The release of electoral roll information is authorised.</para></quote><para>Minister Ellison, that is just plain wrong.

What we did was broach this unlawful use of the Australian electoral roll in the Senate estimates committees in May. This morning, after substantial political debate on this issue, we sought written undertakings from the ATO and the AEC in relation to the use of that material. The government have folded on this matter. They stand humiliated. The Prime Minister has been humiliated. The Special Minister of State has been humiliated. The Australian Electoral Commissioner has been humiliated. And luckily we have been able to stop the Australian Taxation Commissioner being humiliated because the letter is not going out. That begs a few questions in itself. Minister Ellison said in Senate question time today that the Prime Minister's letter is going to be pulped. The opposition wants to know: how much did it cost to print the Prime Minister's illegal letter? How much has it cost to pulp the Prime Minister's illegal letter? The good news for Australians is that the Prime Minister's illegal letter is being pulped. The bad news for Australians is that they are paying for the pulping of the Prime Minister's illegal letter.</para><para>Alarm bells should have been ringing in government about this exercise from the very time that Senator Ray and I raised it in the Senate estimates committee. You would think that the Australian Electoral Commissioner and the Commissioner of Taxation would act on the information that was provided to them. The Electoral Commissioner should have told the Prime Minister of this country that this mail-out was illegal. The taxation commissioner should have told the Prime Minister of this country that this mail-out was illegal and the Prime Minister of this country should not have been associated in using the electoral rolls in such a partisan way for promoting political propaganda on behalf of the government. It is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia and now the Prime Minister finds himself, his government and his Special Minister of State utterly humiliated in relation to this matter. </para><para>What did they do? They proceeded with an unprecedented, poorly planned, unlawful attempt to convince Australian voters of the benefits of the GST and to improperly and illegally use the electoral rolls of this country to do so. Finally, the bureaucracy has come to its senses.

It makes quite clear that the advice that the government is acting upon has absolutely nothing to do with what Senators Faulkner and Ray would have you believe. They would have you believe that they have pulled off some marvellous political legal achievement. They want Senator Sherry to believe it. He is going to have to get up now and make a speech saying the Labor Party was right and we are wrong.</para><para>The fact of the matter, if you look at the behaviour of the Labor Party in government over all of the years since 1993, is that they actually broke the law. Their government did in the examples of the Australian Taxation Office, the Customs Office and the National Crime Authority, which have all been using electronic copies of the electoral roll since 1993 without the authority of prescribing regulations. Madam Deputy President, sitting up as you do just behind Senator Bolkus, you would have noticed that Senator Bolkus was quieter during this question time than he has ever been in my 10 years in the Senate. He sat there like a dog that had had his bone taken away from him. I have never seen Senator Bolkus so quiet. He was not called to order once, because Senator Bolkus has realised that due to his activities as the responsible minister under the Hawke and Keating governments he will be the first person to support legislation to overcome a deficit in the lawâretrospective legislation that may be required, as referred to by the Attorney-General in the other place during question time. The embarrassment for Senator Faulkner, once his colleagues read the Attorney-General's release and then read the letter from Slater and Gordon, is that one more time Senator Faulkner has misfired. He has had the tax advertising misfire, where the Auditor-General has totally vindicated the government's expenditure of money on taxpayers. He has had the Natural Heritage Trust, where once again he accused the government of rorting and the Auditor-General fully supported the government's action. It was the same in relation to the Federation Fund. It was the same in relation to the Baillieu family, where he accused two members of the Baillieu family who had since deceased.</para><para>Now Senator Ellison has reminded us that he has accused us of some exclusive deal with Channel 9. Senator Ellison produced documentation only a few minutes ago to say that one more time Senator Faulkner has not only misled this chamber and made an absolute fool of himself but also misled his colleagues. Senator Cook, who should know better as he has been around here longer than Senator Faulkner, should look very carefully at what Senator Faulkner is doing, because he will cause you great embarrassment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>14982</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to table two lettersâthe letter to Mr Andy Becker, the Electoral Commissioner, which has been incorporated, and the letter to the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âAre you seeking leave to incorporate the one to the taxation commissioner?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The letter read as followsâ</inline></para><quote><para>8 June 2000</para><para>Mr Michael Carmody</para><para>Commissioner of Taxation</para><para>Australian Taxation Office</para><para>2 Constitution Avenue</para><para>Canberra ACT 2600</para><para>By facsimile: (02) 6216 2538</para><para>and by hand</para><para>Our reference: MS2:</para><para>Solicitor: Ken Fowlie</para><para>Direct line: (02) 8267 0603</para><para>Dear Mr Carmody,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CLAIM AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTOR-AL COMMISSION (AEC) AND THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE (ATO)</inline></para><para>Senator John Faulkner and Senator Robert Ray have instructed my firm to act for them in an application against the AEC and the ATO. </para><para>The application relates to the alleged provision by the AEC to the ATO of the electoral roll in electronic form for the purpose of mailing to electors a personal letter from the Prime Minister John Howard and ATO material.</para><para>My clients believe that this action by the AEC is in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, in particular, sections 91 and 91A.

I will come to those letters in a moment. I think it is important to go back to when this issue began, at the estimates hearings of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on Wednesday, 24 May. I would ask anyone observing this debate, particularly the media, to have a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, particularly page 363 onwards. What occurred here was a professional questioning by Senators Ray and Faulkner about the activities of the Electoral Office, particularly their discovery that the Electoral Office had forwarded materialsâthe database in electronic formâto the tax office and then their discovery that the tax office was to send a letter out to all persons enrolled about the GST. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It was very difficult for Senators Robert Ray and Faulkner to find out who was going to sign this letter. That occurred the next day. There was an element of obfuscation and, I think, misleading information was given on that matter. Senators Ray and Faulkner went to two issues with the Electoral Office. Firstly, and I think importantly, they went to the moral issue of this information being made available for a GST propaganda campaign, being made available for a purpose for which it was never intended it would be made available. Secondly, Senators Faulkner and Ray went to the legality of this matter. It is interesting to note the transcript on page 365, when Senator Faulkner said to Mr Becker from the Electoral Office: </para><quote><para>Why didn't you seek legal advice, then, Mr Becker? You just signed it off. Did you seek even internal advice on this? </para><para>Mr BeckerâYes, I did. Of course I did. </para><para>Senator FAULKNERâLet me know what you did. </para><para>Mr BeckerâWe consulted each other about the issue and then felt that it fell within the privacy principles and we supplied the information. </para><para>Senator FAULKNERâWho did you consult? </para><para>Mr BeckerâI spoke with Mr Dacey and our government and legal section. </para></quote><para>That was the start of this sorry tale. Clearly, the Electoral Officeâeven though they sought legal adviceâwere wrong. They were absolutely wrong. The next day it was discovered that the Prime Minister, at public expense, was going to send out a letter to every person in Australiaâsome eight million letters at public expenseâas part of the $400-odd million propaganda campaign being conducted by this government in respect of the GST, which has never been done before to this extent in Australian history. </para><para>The bottom line in this debate is that both morally and legally this government got it wrong. The Prime Minister got it wrong. Minister Ellison got it wrong. This letter is not going to be sent out because it is illegal. It is based on the provision of information given to the tax officeâillegally, as it turns out. That was the assertion, the discovery, of Senators Faulkner and Ray at the estimates committee on Wednesday, 24 Mayâthat it was legally wrong and morally wrong to do so. The bottom line is that eight million letters were to be signed by the Prime Minister. They have been printed and now no longer are going to be sent out. These eight million lettersâgoodness knows what it has costâare going to be pulped or burnt. It is a pity the GST is not being burnt along with the letters. These letters are going to be burnt, a massive waste of taxpayers' money. Senator Ellison has been in denial for the last two weeks. He said on Tuesday of this week:  </para><quote><para>The Electoral Commission has received legal advice today confirming the lawfulness of the supply of that information that confirmed prior legal advice that the Australian Electoral Commissioner had on this point. </para></quote><para>Senator Ellison was wrong. The legal advice that Senator Ellison received was wrong.

In response to that statement I would like to point out that the return to order which was carried yesterday, we would concede, places an onerous responsibility upon the minister to provide information. I need to background the reason for that. At the estimates hearings on 2 May I asked Mr Toller, the CASA director, about a letter he had written to AOC holders dated 12 August. The letter said: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>For too long some CASA staff have believed that they had an obligation to assist marginal operators rather than those operators accountable for the operations they run. </para></quote><para>Mr Toller confirmed that this was still a strong view within the authority. I asked that question in the context of the investigation of an Albury based operator, Air Facilities, that occurred in February last year. I asked questions about the relationship between the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and this company at those hearings. Most of those questions were taken on notice. I was provided with answers, some just prior to this issue being again considered on 24 May. </para><para>But again, when I went to the detail of this matter on the 24 May hearing Mr Laurie Foley sought to take questions on notice. So, despite this matter being considered on 2 Mayâand CASA was advised by my office that I would be asking questions about this operator prior to both of those hearingsâdespite a number of questions being taken on notice from that first hearing, and despite CASA being well aware that I wished to pursue this matter further on 24 May, Mr Foley, the officer, told me that he had not even bothered to review the files. </para><para>The estimates process requires that CASA be accountable to the parliament for the administration of air safety. I acknowledge that the authority comes under considerable scrutiny through this process and generally meets its obligations in this regard. However, in relation to this matter it appears not to have properly met its obligations to this Senate.</para><para>There is a level of confusion over the accuracy of some of the answers Mr Foley provided to the committee in relation to this company and there is a lot of confusion over the accuracy of some of the answers provided on notice. And there is considerable doubt as to whether the terms of Mr Toller's August 1998 letter, which I referred to earlier, are being applied in relation to this operator. We have not been able to get a clear picture of exactly why this operator was formally investigated and its office searched by CASA investigators using a search warrant and its licence suspended as a result or, indeed, why that suspension was revoked within, it appears, a matter of hours prior to its coming into effect. This is all despite CASA having two opportunities to deal properly with the matter. While I acknowledge, as I said earlier, that the workload involved in providing the information contained in the terms of the return to order is considerable, I felt I had no choice, and that decision has been backed by the decision of the Senate. If the Assistant Director, Aviation Safety Compliance is notâas he was notâprepared to review the files on this matter, then the Senate will and must. </para><para>Prior to this matter being dealt with by the Senate, there were conversations between my office and the minister's office about this matter. It was indicated that the government would need some additional time to provide information. However, no amendment to the resolution was sought. I expected that there would be a statement at the time the resolution was carried, but I anticipated in the absence of that that a statement would be made some time today, as it now has. Essentially, the minister is advising that the order will be complied with, but that the material will be reviewed to enable those matters which are, in the terms of the statement by the minister, `not in the public interest to be provided'. I am happyâassuming, of course, the Senate is so happyâthat this material be provided, I would think no later than 5 p.m. on Monday, 19 June, the next day the Senate will sit. That should be sufficient time.</para><para>I note that the government plans to have all the files reviewed. I would have understood that they would be reviewed by legal people, given what has been said, but the statement says that they will be reviewed by the Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Nevertheless, I would remind the minister that, if any material in those files is not provided to the Senate, each document that is not provided must be identified; and, in addition to that, a justification for the exclusion of each document must also be provided. If it is the view of the Senate that it requires any of these excluded documents to be considered or the reason for their exclusion reviewed, then a third party may be engaged by the Senate to undertake a review of that material. So by 5 p.m. on 19 June, I would expect to have all this material tabled, including the schedule of all the excluded material and a justification for the exclusion of each of those so excluded documents. Having said that, may I say it is unfortunate, and an unusual process, for Senate to have required the production of these files, but the approach to the estimates, particularly by Mr Foley, has left the Senate with no choice in the matter.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>14985</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>14985</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Meeting</title><page.no>14985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>)âby leaveâ agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the Economics Legislation Committee be authorised to hold a public meeting during the sitting of the Senate on Monday, 19 June 2000, from 8.00 pm to take evidence for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 2) 2000, and its inquiry into the Sales Tax (Customs) (Industrial Safety Equipment) Bill 2000 and related bills.</para></motion></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>14985</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>14985</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>14985</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the government's response to the report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Access to heritage: User charges in museums, art galleries and national parks, </inline>and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The response read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT, ACCESS TO HERITAGE: USER CHARGES IN MUSEUMS, ART GALLER-IES AND NATIONAL PARKS BY THE SENATE ENVIRONMENT, RECREATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND ARTS REFER-ENCES COMMITTEE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1. Introduction</inline></para><para>The Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee issued in July 1998 the report of an Inquiry titled Access to heritage: user charges in museums, art galleries and national parks.  The terms of reference for the Inquiry by the Committee were:</para><para>The question of balancing public access with the principle of 'user pays' in order to defray the public costs of maintaining natural and cultural heritage assets such as national parks and museums with particular consideration to issues of fairness and equity.  </para><para>The Inquiry made five Recommendations in its Report.  These Recommendations basically proposed that further research be undertaken in relation to aspects of user charges in cultural institutions and National Parks.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2. Government Response</inline></para><para>The Government broadly agrees in principle with the findings of the Inquiry as reflected in the Recommendations.  The Government concurs that for cultural institutions and National Parks there is insufficient data on the incidence and impact of user charges as it affects accessibility.  Similarly, it is unclear how charges on users and related actions may affect the aims, processes, and management of heritage institutions.</para><para>Implementation of the Recommendations would require much research of a specialised nature.  As the Report points out, implementation of proposals would necessarily involve the State and Territory governments as they are responsible for the majority of Australian cultural institutions and heritage related activities.  Consequently, an effective research program would require a co-ordinated approach involving the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, and local government.  However, the Government is mindful of the potential cost for such a research program and which would necessarily involve resource commitments by all governments.  </para><para>As a result of these considerations, the Government believes the first step for any implementation of the Recommendations is a consultation process involving the various levels of government, the affected industry sectors, and other relevant bodies such as the Statistics Working Group of the Cultural Ministers Council.  This consultation process will have the aim of developing options on how best to further implementation generally of the Recommendations.  </para><para>The Government's responses are as follows for the individual recommendations of the Inquiry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 1</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Communications and the Arts, in consultation with State/Territory authorities, local government and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research into the effect of user charges on access and equity in libraries and archives.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the Department) will undertake consultations with the peak bodies in the library and archival fields.  To this end, it will convene a meeting to consult on the general research needs in the sector and how best such needs may be addressed within the sector.  The Department's role primarily would be a facilitative one for any proposals that might arise from the meeting.  Organisations proposed to be invited to the consultative meeting include the: </para><para>Australian Library and Information Association, </para><para>Council of Australian University Librarians, </para><para>Council of Australian State Libraries,</para><para>Australian Council on Archives, and </para><para>Australian Society of Archivists.  </para><para>Invitations would also be issued to key Commonwealth agencies such as the National Library of Australia and National Archives of Australia.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 2</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Communications and the Arts, in consultation with State/Territory authorities, local government and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research into the influence of 'user pays' on access and equity in the regional, local and volunteer-operated museum and gallery sector.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The small museum and gallery sector is very reliant on the assistance of volunteers for their day-to-day operations.  In addition, few institutions in the sector have guaranteed access to resources, or regular funding, in comparison with the arrangements in place for the larger national or state sponsored institutions. The main body providing funding for research and developmental activities in the small museums and gallery sector is the Heritage Collections Council (HCC) established under the Cultural Ministers Council.  The HCC is chaired by the Commonwealth through the Department and its membership includes representatives of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, local government, museum organisations, and heritage institutions.  </para><para>The Department will refer the recommendation to the HCC in the first instance with a view that it develop or sponsor a research strategy on the impact of user-pays issues for the small museum and gallery sector.  Any research would be conducted by professional organisations in the field such as Museums Australia or by means of commissioned activities or commercial consultancies.   </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 3</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Communications and the Arts, in consultation with State/Territory authorities and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research on the relationship between user charges and visitation in cultural institutions.</para><para>The Committee recommends that Environment Australia, in consultation with State/Territory authorities and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research into the relationship between user charges and visitation in national parks.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts through the Statistics Working Group collects on a continuing basis visitor data and associated information about activities of cultural institutions generally.  In particular, data is collected on the operation of museums and galleries and the cultural impact on the community of their activities.  This analytical work is undertaken by the Department in conjunction with regular surveys of cultural activities that are conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  </para><para>The Department will place the relationship between charges and visitor numbers on the work program for further consideration by the Statistics Working Group.  </para><para>Environment Australia has as a general principle for National Parks a policy of user pays in situations where it is economically viable to do so.  The economic viability for charging depends upon factors such as the size of the Park; impact of the charges generally on the community; and the number of entry points and levels of staffing and resources in the Park.  Generally, fees are charged for the larger Parks such as Uluru and Kakadu but not for smaller Parks.  Further research, along the lines recommended, would be both useful and relevant for data on the cost of collecting fees and the start-up and maintenance costs for the necessary associated infrastructure.  Also, it would be particularly useful to have comparative studies between institutions that in recent years have decided to remove entry fees and similar charges and those institutions which have introduced user charges for the first time.  </para><para>Environment Australia supports in principle research in the areas nominated by the Recommendation and will raise the issues in appropriate forums with the States and Territories.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 4</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Department of Communications and the Arts, in consultation with State/Territory authorities and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research into the trend of user charges and similar revenue versus budget funding among cultural institutions.  </para><para>The Committee recommends that Environment Australia, in consultation with State/Territory authorities and relevant peak bodies, should sponsor research into the trend of user charges and similar revenues versus budget funding among nature conservation agencies.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts supports in principle research along the lines proposed by the Recommendation.

It was given a reference to inquire into and report on the impact of market concentration in the retail sector and recommend possible revenue neutral courses of action for the Government to take.</para><para>The Committee presented its report, Fair Market or Market Failure, on 30 August 1999 which contained 10 recommendations.  The report also contained a supplementary recommendation from Senator Ron Boswell and six supplementary recommendations from Senator Andrew Murray.</para><para>On consideration of the focus of the report, its recommendations and the overwhelming weight of submissions to the Committee, the Government has concentrated on and directed its response to that part of the retail industry associated with the retail grocery sector.  It is within the retail grocery sector that the concerns emerged which have driven the recommendations of the Committee.</para><para>The following are the Government's official responses to the Committee's recommendations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATIONS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that the Trade Practices Act be amended to give the ACCC the power to undertake representative actions and to seek damages on behalf of third parties under Part IV of the Act.</para><para>The Committee believes that, due to this measure, the ACCC may be burdened by an increased caseload. The Committee therefore recommends that the Government give consideration to providing extra funding for this purpose to the ACCC in future Budget Appropriations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government will proceed to implement this recommendation which is consistent with Government policy.  The Government previously brought this measure forward in the context of the New Deal: Fair Deal package of fair trading measures in 1998.  At that time, the measure was blocked in the Senate.  However, the Government remains convinced that this initiative will be of significant advantage to small business, which will now be able to have action taken on its behalf by the ACCC.</para><para>Small businesses may not have the time, resources or legal expertise to engage in lengthy legal proceedings under Part IV of the Trade Practices Act.  The ACCC is better placed to initiate legal proceedings on behalf of small business for significant and broad-ranging breaches of the competition provisions in the Act.</para><para>Given that this measure will impact on the operation of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, the Government will need to consult with the States and Territories and seek their agreement, as per the requirements of the 1995 Intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement. The Treasurer will write to the Premiers and Chief Ministers to seek their agreement, as per the requirements of the 1995 Intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement.  </para><para>The Government will monitor the effect of this measure on the ACCC's resources.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para>The Committee is of the view that the ACCC should consider heavily concentrated regional markets, such as that which exists in South East Queensland, when assessing acquisitions or mergers under the provisions of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>The Committee therefore recommends that section 50(6) of the Trade Practices Act be amended to provide for the definition of `market' to include a `regional market'.  Thus, subsection 6 should provide that: </para><para>In this section: `market' means a substantial market for goods or services in Australia, in a State or a Territory, or in a region of Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government supports this measure as a means of ensuring that the impact on competition in a significant regional market is considered by the ACCC when assessing proposed mergers and acquisitions.  The Government notes that whilst the ACCC's Merger Guidelines explicitly state that the relevant substantial market can be a regional market, amending section 50(6) as per the Report's recommendation will clarify the Government's policy intent and confirm current practice.</para><para>Given that this measure will require an amendment to Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, the Government will also consult with the States and Territories and seek their agreement on this measure, as per the requirements of the 1995 Intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends the establishment of an independent Retail Industry Ombudsman through which small business can bring complaints or queries relating to the retailing sector for speedy resolution. The Committee believes that the Retail Industry Ombudsman should consider, among other things, the application of the Retail Industry Code of Conduct (Recommendation 5) in his or her deliberations.</para><para>Where complaints received by the Ombudsman raise issues that fall within the jurisdiction of another established body, such as the ACCC, those complaints should be referred to such bodies for further investigation.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Retail Industry Ombudsman be appointed and funded by the Government.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Retail Industry Ombudsman be required to produce a bi-annual report to the Parliament in order to increase transparency in the retailing industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government supports an Ombudsman scheme as a desirable alternative to costly and lengthy litigation for small and large businesses.</para><para>The Government will provide advice to the retail sector to assist it to establish a Retail Grocery Industry Ombudsman Scheme.  The Government has already published guidelines on industry-based dispute resolution.  In August 1997, the Government released Benchmarks for Industry-Based Customer Dispute Resolution to provide some guidance to industry on the desirable characteristics to be built into such schemes (namely: accessibility, independence, fairness, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness).  The Government has also sponsored the production of a kit, Resolving Small Business Disputes: Six steps to successful dispute resolution, which provides advice to small business operators.</para><para>The Government believes that the best way to ensure the success of industry dispute resolution in the retailing sector is to place the responsibility in the hands of the retail industry.  Clearly, industry players are best placed to know what kinds of disputes are likely to arise and how such disputes may most effectively be resolved.</para><para>Government policy is to support the establishment and development of industry self regulation.  To this end, a committee is to be tasked to develop a Retail Grocery Industry Code of Conduct with the terms of reference as outlined in the response to Recommendation 5 below.  These terms of reference advocate that the Committee constituted to develop the Code will also address the issue of an ombudsman scheme which will form part of the code and how it will structured with its jurisdiction, powers, review and reporting requirements defined and delineated.</para><para>To demonstrate its commitment to the success of the Retail Grocery Industry Ombudsman Scheme, the Government will fully fund the operation of the Scheme.  The Ombudsman will be required to report on his or her activities and financial performance on a regular basis.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that mandatory notification of retail grocery store acquisitions by publicly listed corporations be prescribed within the mandatory Code of Conduct (Recommendation 5), and approved by the ACCC, with a requirement that the ACCC consult with local authorities and other relevant parties in order to make an informed assessment of the likely impact on local businesses of such acquisitions. The Committee recommends that the ACCC also be required to assess and approve new store development applications on a similar basis, and to provide a detailed response to these notifications within 30 days.</para><para>The Committee appreciates that the drafting of a mandatory Code of Conduct may take some time to complete. The Committee therefore recommends that, as an interim measure, the Minister make a direction that mandatory notification be required to take effect immediately.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government supports the idea of a code of conduct for the retail grocery industry (see response to Recommendation 5 below).  However, the Government does not consider there is a need for mandatory pre-notification of retail grocery store acquisitions by publicly listed companies to be prescribed within a code of conduct.  Mandatory pre-notification systems can be complex and difficult to administer.  A pre-notification requirement would increase costs for businesses, and - most importantly - be unnecessary because the Trade Practices Act already prohibits acquisitions or mergers which would have the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market.  However the issue of notification can be considered by the Retail Grocery Code of Conduct Committee in its discussions for possible inclusion in the Code of Conduct.  This issue has been included in the Committee's terms of reference outlined in the response to Recommendation 5 below.</para><para>There is a commercial incentive for such parties in the retail industry to seek the views of the ACCC prior to embarking upon an acquisition that may involve very significant financial outlays and attract adverse publicity.</para><para>As development and town planning issues are the responsibility of State, Territory and local governments, the Government considers it is not appropriate for the ACCC to assess new store development proposals.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends the drafting of a Retail Industry Code of Conduct by the ACCC in consultation with retail industry groups and other relevant parties for the purpose of regulating the conduct associated with vertical relationships throughout the supply chain.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Code of Conduct be a mandatory code, and should contain a precise form of dispute resolution, with the process of resolution clearly spelled out.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Code of Conduct be drafted to include specific provisions that address:</para><para>(a)	The general principle of `like terms for like customers' - where the ACCC may seek information from corporations, on a confidential basis, revealing key terms and conditions of contracts of supply.</para><para>(b)	Transparency in `vulnerable' supply markets - where growers have to deal with a range of market characteristics, including perishability, market volatility and a high degree of risk exposure.</para><para>(c)	Product labelling and packaging requirements - with a view to implementing a more equitable system than that which currently exists.</para><para>(d)	Contractual uncertainty - in particular, the passing of ownership of produce and the circumstances under which produce can be returned.</para><para>(e)	Truth in branding - so that businesses, which are subsidiaries of, or are substantially owned by, a listed public company or major retailer, note that association on shop front signage, in advertising, on stationery, and so on.</para><para>The Committee recommends that disputes falling under the Code of Conduct should not be limited to resolution by the Retail Industry Ombudsman. For example, disputes raising issues relevant to National Competition Policy or the Trade Practices Act would be more appropriately dealt with by the ACCC.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government believes that properly formulated codes of conduct that enjoy the support of an industry can be of benefit to all industry participants.  A Code of Conduct for the Retail Grocery Industry may help to resolve some of the difficulties that were raised in the context of this Inquiry. </para><para>The Government's preference is for industry to take ownership of self-regulatory schemes with minimal government involvement. The Government is committed to industry self-regulation to address marketplace problems as an alternative to onerous regulation. The regulatory option of mandatory codes will only be exercised where voluntary self-regulation has failed and where the market failure or social policy objectives addressed in a code are serious enough to warrant enforcement of the code at law.</para><para>The Government's policy with regard to the appropriate use of voluntary and mandatory industry codes of conduct is set out in the Codes of Conduct Policy Framework booklet (released by the then Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, the Hon Warren Truss MP, in March 1998) and the Prescribed Codes of Conduct policy guideline released by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Hon Joe Hockey MP, in May 1999.</para><para>The Prescribed Codes of Conduct guideline identifies a number of criteria which should be met in order for the Government to pursue a prescribed (mandatory) code.  Among these are that there must be significant and irremediable deficiencies in any existing self-regulatory regime - for example, the existing voluntary code fails to address industry problems.  A further criterion is that a range of self-regulatory options and `light-handed' quasi-regulatory options have been examined and demonstrated to be ineffective. </para><para>Such pre-conditions for a mandatory code have not been demonstrated in relation to the retail sector and it is clear that industry should be given a chance to design a self-regulatory mechanism before the Government considers intervening.</para><para>The Government is confident that the retail grocery industry is capable of resolving the kind of difficulties raised by the Committee in a voluntary code.  Clearly, businesses within the retail sector are best placed to assess the nature of the difficulties being experienced, and therefore the best ways of resolving such difficulties.  The Government is prepared, therefore, to give the industry itself the first opportunity to rectify its own problems, as identified in the Committee's report.  </para><para>However, to ensure the success of a voluntary code, careful consideration needs to be given to the specific provisions and to the industry participants invited to subscribe.  Codes may establish some ground-rules for commercial negotiations but should not inhibit competition and bargaining.  Care would need to be taken that a retail code did not have the effect of inhibiting retail chains from driving hard bargains with suppliers that enable retail chains to offer consumers the best quality at the lowest prices.</para><para>A retail grocery code developed by the retail industry should not seek to bind manufacturers in their dealings with retailers.  Accordingly, the `like terms for like customers' proposal may not belong in a retail code.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the former price discrimination prohibition in the Trade Practices Act, section 49, was repealed in 1995 after the Hilmer Inquiry found the provision to be contrary to the objective of economic efficiency and of no assistance to small business.</para><para>In addition, the proposal for the ACCC to be able to obtain information about supply terms raises a number of issues.  First, there is the question of whether it is the role of the ACCC to monitor price discrimination per se.  Second, there is the question of whether the ACCC should have a right of access to information about supply terms.  The Government believes that these would be inappropriate.  Other suggestions made by the Committee for inclusion in a Code may also need careful consideration, particularly where regulations already exist (eg, labelling).</para><para>Finally, the Committee has proposed that the ACCC should be responsible for the drafting of the retail grocery industry code.  The Government believes this proposal is inappropriate and would create a conflict of interest for the ACCC.  However, it may be appropriate for the ACCC to be consulted during preparation of the Retail Grocery Industry Code.</para><para>To assist the process of developing the code, the Government proposes the establishment of an industry funded code committee to be tasked with developing a voluntary Code of Conduct for the retail grocery industry.  It is intended that the Committee would start its deliberations in February 2000 and that the Code would finalised and operating by 1 July 2000.  In order to ensure that the views of the various interested parties are adequately accounted for, the committee will comprise:</para><para>an independent chair appointed by the Government and with appropriate legal background;</para><para>two representatives nominated by the Australian Retailers Association;</para><para>two representatives of large retailers;</para><para>one consumer representative;</para><para>two representatives nominated by the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia;</para><para>one representative nominated by the National Farmers' Federation;</para><para>one representative of small retail suppliers;</para><para>one general representative of small retail business; and</para><para>one specialist legal appointment by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.</para><para>To support this Committee, a secretariat will be established which will include two Government representatives (one from the Office of Small Business and one from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission).</para><para>The Government will task the Code Committee with the following draft terms of reference in developing a code:</para><para>address the issue of an ombudsman scheme as part of the code and how it will be structured with its jurisdiction, powers, review and reporting requirements defined and delineated;</para><para>improving transparency in `vulnerable' supply markets - where growers have to deal with a range of market characteristics, including perishability, market volatility and a high degree of risk exposure;</para><para>raising product labelling and packaging standards;</para><para>reducing contractual uncertainty, in particular, the passing of ownership of produce and the circumstances under which produce can be returned;</para><para>branding, particularly whether businesses, which are subsidiaries of, or are substantially owned by, a listed public company or major retailer, note that association on shop front signage, in advertising, on stationery etc; </para><para>consideration of notification issues of retail grocery store acquisitions and of the acquisitions of grocery wholesalers by retailers and vice-versa.</para><para>The terms of reference deal exclusively with the retail grocery industry sector and do not apply to other areas of the retail sector.</para><para>The operation and effectiveness of the Code would be independently reviewed after three years of operation, or sooner if the Government believes circumstances warrant an earlier review. Should a review or developments indicate an unsatisfactory participation level, the Government could then pursue the option of a mandatory Code.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para>The Committee considers that the $1 million transactional limitation of section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act hinders access by some small businesses to the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Act. The Committee therefore recommends that this limit be increased to $3 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Government is committed to ensuring that the unconscionable conduct provisions are accessible to small business.  The Government therefore acknowledges the views of the Committee and will seek to increase the $1 million transactional limitation of section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act to $3 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline></para><para>The Committee is concerned that Recommendation 2.1 of the Reid Report, which deals with the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code, has not been implemented. In particular, the Committee is concerned that, in major shopping centres, there is a lack of transparency with regard to the cost of floor space rent. That is, the seller (landlord) has knowledge - the buyer (prospective tenant) has none. Prospective tenants are therefore prevented from making informed decisions in assessing the `market rent' as it applies to particular areas of retail space. </para><para>The Committee therefore recommends that the Government re-visit this recommendation, with a view to implementing a Uniform Retail Tenancy Code through the operations of the Council of Australian Governments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>Retail tenancy issues are the responsibility of State and Territory governments.  The Commonwealth Government did consider these issues in the context of the Reid Report, but decided then not to proceed with the proposal.  In addition, since that time, other changes have been implemented to deal with retail tenancy issues and the Government does not accept that it should re-visit this matter.</para><para>The Government gained a commitment from all State and Territory jurisdictions in December 1997 to introduce key minimum standards into their retail tenancy legislation or regulation.  These standards covered issues such as disclosure, rent reviews, ratchet clauses, relocation expenses, outgoings and assignment.  All jurisdictions (with the exception of the Northern Territory, which is currently developing its own retail tenancy regulation or legislation) have now substantially implemented these minimum standards.  As a result retail tenants across Australia now enjoy considerably greater protection against unfair trading, and have also been spared the additional burden of compliance that would have been delivered by an additional layer of regulation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that major supermarket chains take note of widespread community and pharmaceutical industry concerns that the nature of the role played by pharmacists is unique, as it relates to matters of public health. The Committee is therefore of the view that expansion by the major chains into the dispensing of pharmaceutical products should be discouraged.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments are currently conducting a National Competition Policy review of the legislation that regulates the ownership, location and registration of pharmacies.  This Review is being chaired by Mr Warwick Wilkinson AM, and has presented its Preliminary Report to the Prime Minister.

In debate, I wish to touch upon the nature of the transmission facilities, the present coverage of Radio Australia, the consequences of the inability to use the Cox Peninsula transmitter, the value of Radio Australia broadcasting from the Cox Peninsula, some implications for Australia's foreign policy, the possible consequences of the sale and, if time, the continuing apparent vendetta by this government against the ABC.</para><para>We are fortunate to have a recent report to the Senate on this issue. In May 1997 there was a report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. At pages 81 and 82, it outlines the detail of those transmission facilities. The report identified that Radio Australia currently transmits from 14 short-wave transmittersâthree at Brandon and six at Shepparton, while Darwin has five operational transmitters, with four currently being scheduled. The significant upgrading of Australia's short-wave transmitters, amounting to $23 million, had taken place between 1991 and the time of writing of the report in 1997. The Darwin Cox Peninsula station was the largest broadcasting station in Australia for radio or TV. It was originally built to serve South-East Asia following Sukarno's confrontation campaign. It was damaged by Cyclone Tracy in 1974 and rebuilt in 1981-82 at a cost of $12 million. As part of an extensive upgrade in 1994-95, two new state-of-the-art transmitters were installed, following the Tiananmen Square incident. These transmitters are extremely power-efficient, can be modified for digital operation and are capable of broadcasting in single band mode, which may be required for international broadcasts after 2000. The transmitter computer systems have been upgraded at a cost of several million dollars. The Cox Peninsula station is the most sophisticated of Radio Australia's short-wave transmission facilities, and has a power output only exceeded by the low frequency H.E. Holt North West Cape naval communications station. In summary, it is an expensive, well maintained, regularly upgraded, power efficient, sophisticated short-wave transmission facility at Cox Peninsula, with a price of many tens of millions of dollars in establishment, maintenance and upgrading over the years.  </para><para>In terms of coverage for Radio Australia out of that area and out of other transmitter facilities, Radio Australia broadcasts programs in three ways: through short-wave transmissions from Shepparton in Victoria, since 1997 and the Cox Peninsula closure, and from Brandon in Queensland into the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Coral Seaâa very limited range. Radio Australia also broadcasts through satellite to Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, PNG, Tonga, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. There is also the rebroadcasting of packaged programs and some limited news and current affairs into Manila, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.</para><para>The consequences of the inability to use Cox Peninsula are many and quite far reaching. Radio Australia's coverage has been reduced by 80 to 90 per cent. The strength of transmission is considerably weaker: the power comes from Shepparton at 100 kilowatts, whereas at Cox Peninsula it was 250 kilowatts, and it is much further away from those northern parts of our immediate region. The transmissions no longer reach parts of South-East Asia, all of Vietnam, all of Cambodia and, perhaps most interestingly, much of China. In case of transmission failures or faults at Sheppartonâand we are advised by the ABC that they have been quite common in recent timesâtransmissions are reduced to Brandon's limited coverage for short wave and to other means: that is, by satellite or rebroadcast. The Cox Peninsula facilities, as I said, were capable of digital transmissions, whereas Shepparton's are not. The final point to make is that Cox Peninsula, Shepparton and, of course, Carnarvon in Western Australia were designed to be complementary: that is, to collectively transmit broadcasts to a maximum coverage area.</para><para>In summary, the saleâand, as yet, no access by Radio Australia to similar transmission facilitiesâhas a number of important consequences for the national interest of Australia. The coverage has been considerably reduced, the strength of transmission has been made significantly weaker, and the transmission no longer reaches parts of Asiaâincluding much of China. Faults in part of the system at Shepparton, with the closure of Cox, mean that we can rely only on the Brandon facility or other means of transmission. In the digital world, as we move to digital transmission as the norm out of analog, the government is selling to a foreign group the facility at Cox Peninsula, which is capable of digital transmission, and is retaining the Shepparton facility, which is not.</para><para>Let us at this stage examine in detail some of the consequences of not transmitting into China, for example. Consider for a moment the significance of China on the world stage. The government in 1996-97, shortly after it was elected, did a review of defence and foreign policy matters. After that review, it significantly upgraded the relationship between the government of Australia and the government of China. It said for the first time that China was one of four countries critical to the future of Australia, the others being Japan, the United States and Indonesia. But China was put into that list for the first time; it had never been done before. That government review was occasioned by the threat of a ban on visits to and from Australia by Chinese government officials arising from some actionsâand, it must be said, some misunderstandings of actionsâon the part of the Howard government by the Chinese government.</para><para>As part of the resolution of those differences, it was made clear to the Australian government that the authorities in China regard Australia as being within their sphere of interest and that they had a right to be making points of some significance to the government of this country. But turning to more recent times, consider the developments in China that directly impact on Australia. Hong Kong, which is a major trading port in the world and where there are something in the order of 40,000 Australians resident, was returned to the administration of the Chinese government. There are significantâat the moment, quietâundercurrents on cross-straits issues with Taiwan. We will soon have the admittance of China to the World Trade Organisation, following a recent vote by the US House of Representatives. It is the clear desire of China to be the dominant regional power and to reduce US influences in this part of the world. </para><para>All of those issues directly impact on the critical, ongoing interests of Australia. It does not matter from what perspective you do the analysisâwhether from a defence perspective, a human rights perspective or the even more narrow free trade perspectiveâall of the developments in recent times in China impact upon of the future of this country. Yet the one vehicle we had for putting our message into southern China, into regional China and into the coastal, rich developing areas of China has been sold to a British based organisation. The one vehicle through which we could regularly put out our message directly or indirectly, through a variety of means and programs, has been sold off to an organisation that, as I understand it, is wholly owned in Britain and has a purpose that we do not need to discuss. The point is that the ability of the Australian government, through its various agencies and arms, to put messages into significant parts of China and areas immediately south of China has been eliminated, if not reduced, by the action of this government in selling the Cox Peninsula transmitter.</para><para>It was the one vehicle we had for imparting values, perspectives, different interpretations and alternative analysis of current events or topical matters to the towns, cities, regions, citizens and officials of China. It was the one vehicle we had for imparting information to the various interest groups in Chinaâsuch as the free and active democratic trade unionists that still exist in part of China, the active human rights groups and campaigns working right throughout many cities of China, the prisoners of conscience in various parts of Chinaâand, indeed, at another level, to the various competing business groups and organisations seeking to develop products and markets that exist in various cities. The final group that, I suppose, we would be interested in sending a message to are the various elites in China, who run the administration and the government of that country, whether they be senior officials of the Communist Party, the military or other government officials at various levels.</para><para>Our ability to send a message, on an ongoing basis, to the regions, the various interest groups and the various elites in China who administer that country, which may be of value to this country, and our ability to inform and to be part of the process of education and information dissemination in that country and in other parts of Asia and the Pacific has been considerably reduced, if not completely cut out, by the decision of this government to sell the Cox Peninsula transmission facility to a British based organisation. We view thatâas we have been saying since 1997; it was part and parcel of that Senate reference committee report and it has been the subject of debate here in more recent timesâas being a major retrograde step. So those comments in respect of imparting views or perhaps of having some influence in China and in other parts of Asia are surrendered, given away forever, for a lousy price. I have made my comments pertinent to China as the dominant power in this part of the world but, undoubtedly, the same arguments, comments and views could be expressed for parts of Vietnam, where we are no longer able to send our message, parts of Indonesia and the eastern parts of the Pacific as well, because the government has sold the Cox Peninsula transmission facility.</para><para>So that leads us, necessarily, to consider a number of consequential issues: the nature of the transmission facilities; the value, not price, of radio Australia; the implications, as I said, for Australian foreign policy; and, the important consequences that we now have to address because of the sale of the Cox Peninsula transmission facilities. We are advised by the relevant government department that the recent contract for the 10-year licence of the Cox Peninsula transmitter site was for the purchase of all movable plant and equipment located at the facility by the organisation known as Christian Vision. This was described by Senator Ellison as being the `best value to the Commonwealth.' The price received for the physical sale of all facilities of the transmission network was the `best value to the Commonwealth'. And while he did not say it, having said that it was the best value to the Commonwealth, not the best price received, it is a fair indication that he meant that all of the other considerations that I have put in this debate are of lesser value or of no value to the current government. </para><para>The value of Radio Australia can be described quite simply. It has many important functions in broadcasting from the Cox Peninsula transmitter. It improves Australia's position and reputation in the region as a consequence of the recognised relationship between Australia's overseas information and cultural activitiesâspecifically, I mean foreign broadcast servicesâand foreign and trade policy interests. Secondly, it promotes stability in the regionâa region which appears to be erupting at a rate of knotsâthrough the provision of extensive and reliable news services and information into the region, which fosters cultural understanding. It provides cost-effective promotion of Australia's many national interests. It is fair to say that Radio Australia's broadcasts to our region communicate with integrity, independence and quality programming the views that are held in this country.</para><para>The implications for our foreign policy are many. We say at the outset that our foreign policy cannot be valued in dollars and cents. Radio Australia's programming advances Australia's trade and diplomatic objectives by specifically relating to and drawing attention to trade, business, education, tourism and diplomacy, and by conveying subtle messages to the region about life in Australia, the nature of our country, the hopes and disappointments of the Australian people, our achievements as a nation, our democratic principles and our perception of issues and events which affect Australia, the region and the world.</para><para>The sale of the Cox Peninsula site, which in the past has facilitated the achievement of these important foreign policy objectives, suggests that the government has no interest in the region, as it does not care as much as it should about Australia's reputation in the region. One asks the rhetorical question: what kind of foreign policy is this? The reduction in broadcast conveys the Australian government's disinterest in South-East Asia, resulting obviously in a loss of face and respect for Australia in the region, particularly when that job is now being taken overâor that market is being entered intoâby Radio Netherlands, Voice of Britain and similar radio outlets arising out of the United States.</para><para>The sale of Cox Peninsula contradicts, in our view, the stated policy of the governmentâto have close relations with Asia and to increase trade with regional countriesâby reducing Radio Australia's means of achieving these goals. Arrangements are necessary to allow Radio Australia to broadcast into Asia. Any opportunity for access to the Cox Peninsula transmitter should be used for the benefit of Radio Australia to mitigate the impact of the loss of the Australian voice to the world, which has been occasioned by the sale of the Cox Peninsula transmitter.</para><para>What are the important consequences of the sale of the transmission facility? A valuable and vital Australian asset has been sold to an overseas company which has no concern for Australia's national interests. It is not in their mission statement to have concern for Australia's national interests. From the published press reports, it is quite clear that they have a particular purpose and mission which they give great value to. The point is: it could preclude Radio Australia from accessing the site and thereby from achieving important functions by broadcasting from Cox Peninsula. An adverse impact on Australia's national interests is the inevitable result of Radio Australia's diminished capacity to broadcast into the South Asian and South-East Asian regions.</para><para>This diminished impact of broadcasting into this area comes at a time when there is significant upheaval in the region. Many listeners would be looking to Radio Australia for accurate and unbiased news and information about the developments in their own countries or adjoining and nearby areas. Radio Australia's broadcasts should be restored, particularly in light of the regional turmoil, including recent troubles in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Indonesia, and the consequent need for safety guidelines for expatriates and for reliable and unbiased information and news. The problem we have is that we cannot get the information out. The information is not being transmitted, because the scope of coverage and the power that is necessary to transmit the information are no longer available to the people who administer the Cox Peninsula facility. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14998</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt would be fair to say that we on this side are sadly disappointed by Senator Bishop's performance.

We have positive environmental outcomes, but all those good news stories are not the subject of today's debate. Labor has had to fossick around to try to find something negative to pin on this government but, as I will point out later, this is something that is not as negative as Senator Bishop has sought to paint it. Indeed, today they might have come up with some announcements on how, if they were ever to win government again, they would not go back to the Commonwealth Employment Service, which proved such a disaster, or how they would ensure that, if ever they embarked on major acquisitions again, they would not allow people like Mr Beazley and Senator Ray to be in control of acquisitions such as the Collins class.</para></talk.start><para>We have before us this afternoon this four-part motion.

Cox Peninsula is near Darwin. It is a short-wave transmission facility previously operated by the National Transmission Agency. In 1996 the Mansfield review of the ABC recommended that the requirement for the ABC to broadcast programs to audiences outside Australia should cease. That was the recommendation of the Mansfield review. Of course, once you come up with the meaty substance of reviews such as this, all of a sudden the opposition go quiet, as they should. At the time of the review, the ABC acknowledged that Radio Australia was not a top priority issue. The chairman of the ABC on 7 June this year admitted that in late 1996-early 1997 Radio Australia did not have too many influential friends either inside the ABC or outside it. Of course, lacking influential friends, one wonders whether the Labor Party would be described as being one of those friends.

Radio Australia has also made its service available through a variety of alternate transmissions mechanisms, including satellite, the Internet and terrestrial rebroadcasts from in-country transmitters.

I just find it astounding that, in the year 2000, we can have people in the Senate who can be so objectionable and seek to vilify elements of the Christian religion. As part of the tender process for Cox, Christian Vision and other short-listed tenderers were subject to a national interest assessment process. We believe that, given that process, it was appropriate to allow Christian Vision that 10-year licence.

There are fair and open tender processes in place in this country and if a Christian organisation happens to win it fairly and squarely on that basis then it will not be denied access simply because it has a particular religious point of view. The interjections of Senator Carr and the comments by Senator Bourne suggest that, as a result of the religious beliefs of this particular charitable company, they should have been disqualified. I find that assertion objectionable. I find it a terrible reflection on the 70 to 80 per cent of Australians who happen to identify with the Christian faith. </para><para>The motion then goes on to say that the sale of the transmitter betrays Australia's national interest in Asia. There is no way that anybody in Asia would make such a stupid assertion. It would only come from the discredited opposition. Everybody in Asia knows the huge commitment we make to Asia, through supporting the International Monetary Fund, for the economies of Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea. Out of the whole region, we were one of two countries to make that sort of contribution to stabilise their economies. They know the commitment we make. In the Pacific Islands, they know that we fund one-third of the moneys required to run the South Pacific Commission. They know Australia's contribution. To cap it all off, something that the opposition will not mention at all is our great success as a nation, the political leadership and also the wonderful service of our men and women in the defence forces in East Timor. That shows our commitment to the Asian community. </para><para>The government have taken a different approach to Asia. The previous approach by the Labor Party's Mr Keating was to tug your forelock to people like the discredited President Suharto, do terrible sleazy money deals with them, engage in piggery purchases and sales, and get sleazy money from Indonesiaâgetting it backwards and forwards. They are the sorts of deals the Labor Party believes mean engaging in Asia. We say that is not the sort of reputation that we want to gain for ourselves; we want integrity. In comparison, the Prime Minister, John Howard, has shown integrity and led this nation with integrity. The INTERFET involvement with Indonesia and East Timor has been an outstanding success. Because of our success, we were able to gain the support of other countries in the region. If we had been so distant from all the other countries in Asia, do you honestly believe that all these other countries would have come to support the leadership that we showed? Of course they would not have. But they did. Why? Because our Prime Minister is respected in the Asian community as a man of integrity who will not go sleazing around to some of these countries for funny business deals like the former Labor leader, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, did. They know that with John Howard and with Alexander Downer as foreign minister what you see is what you get. You will get the rule of law and there will be integrity in our dealings.</para><para>There is another matter that needs to be considered, and that is that the licence was a 10-year non-exclusive licence to operate the Cox Peninsula facility and it is now open for the ABC to negotiate a commercial agreement for access to the transmitters.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âIt is open for the Islamic organisations as well?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âSenator Carr asks whether it is open for the Muslim societies as well.

The vilification of this company and the sorts of interjections made by Senator Carr really are quite distasteful. I hope <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> got most of Senator Carr's distasteful interjections, because people will see that this is, in fact, not really anything to do with the national interest but everything to do with his dislike for any organisation that seems to have the word `Christian' in it. There has been, within this parliament in recent times, vilification and interjections from those opposite to colleagues of mine who are members of the Christian fellowshipâand they are the most distasteful sorts of interjections. Whilst I do not really mind them that muchâit is a bit like water off a duck's back to me, I must admitâthey show quite clearly that there are elements or people within the Labor Party, and I would not put Senator Bishop into that category necessarily, who are more motivated by the fact that the word `Christian' appears in the title of the company concerned than anything else. The national interest of this country has been well served ever since 1996. It will continue to be well served by this government. Our international relations with Asia have never been higher, have never been better and will continue to expand as our economic relations with Asia expand, the interaction with our defence forces expands and, indeed, the tourism flow between our countries expands. All those are indicators that we have an excellent relationship with Asia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>15001</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat an offence to the memory of Sir Robert Menzies.

I think that Sir Robert Menzies, in starting Radio Australia, did one of the greatest things that any Australian Prime Minister has done for this country. What a legacyâa brilliant legacy being destroyed on its 50th anniversary by this government. In 1950 Sir Robert Menzies established Radio Australia as part of the ABC in order to `ensure the broadcasting of a reliable source of news and current affairs to our neighbours in this region'. That is what he was trying to do, and that is obviously what this governmentâand Senator Abetz in particularâis keen to make sure does not happen. Let me go through a few of the things that Senator Abetz saidâsome of the less offensive ones; I will get to the more offensive ones a bit later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>First of all, he mentioned the Mansfield review. As we all know, the Mansfield reviewâI have a copy of it hereâis something that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, loves quoting when he is talking about Radio Australia. But, if you have a look at the terms of reference in the back of the Mansfield review, which anyone can read if they like, guess what: Radio Australia and its future is not included. Mr Mansfield was not asked to look into the future of Radio Australia and, as a result, Mr Mansfield had no submissions on the future of Radio Australia. Mr Mansfield, off his own bat, came up with a recommendation on something that he was not asked to come up with a recommendation on. Then the ministerâand Senator Abetz, who has obviously got his notes from the minister; he must have done, because it is the minister's favourite topicâsays, `Oh, well, Mr Mansfield said we have to get rid of Radio Australia so we had better get rid of it.' That was not a particularly open, transparent or interesting part of this review. Mr Mansfield came and saw me as he was conducting this review. He talked to me about a lot of things in relation to the ABC; he did not talk to me about Radio Australia. That is because it is not part of the terms of reference. I have no idea where Mr Mansfield got that recommendation from; it just came out of the air. So there you go: let us not use the Mansfield review. </para><para>Then Senator Abetz told us that it is a miracleâand it probably is a miracleâthat Radio Australia is still broadcasting in English and in Tok Pisin and that it goes out to the Pacific. Yes, it does go out to the Pacific. He told us that Radio Australia is broadcasting in short wave to parts of Indonesia, to PNG and to the Pacific. Yes, it is. Yes, it is doing it from Shepparton and, yes, it is doing it from Brandon. Who has questioned that? Nobody has questioned that. That is not the problem. The problem is Radio Australia is going out in short wave only to small parts of Indonesia. It is going out to other parts of Indonesia via a transmitter in Taiwan which is about to be turned off, because this government will not give it the money to keep that turned on. So there you go: it is not going out in short wave to most of Indonesia.</para><para>It is certainly not going out in short wave to anywhere else in Asia. Yes, they are putting out a small signal in Mandarin, but guess how that is going out: it is going out by satellite and it is being rebroadcast. It is probably being rebroadcast without the news and without the current affairs, and it is being rebroadcast to people who have a satellite dish. There is not an awful lot of ordinary Chinese people who have satellite dishesâthey are a bit expensive. There is an awful lot of them with short-wave radios, but they cannot pick the signal up. I have a short-wave radioâit cost me about $42. I also have a computer at homeâthat cost me about $2,000. There is a vast difference there. I can pick up Radio National on my computer and I can pick it up on my short wave; for $2,000 I can hear the news, or for $42 I can hear the newsâbut not if I am in Asia, so let us forget that one.</para><para>The government is also saying that the signal is going out to India. Yes, it is. It is going out to India by satellite. You say that it is going to Laos, to Cambodia, to Vietnam, to all these places in Asiaâyes, via satellite. I do not know why you cannot understand. Actually, maybe I do know why you cannot understandâI should not say that. The government is saying that a voice into Asia is being maintained. Yes, but it is without the news and without the current affairs, unless you have a satellite dish to pick it up. And, of course, satellite signals can be turned off. There is in-country rebroadcasting, and it is absolutely ridiculous for anybody to think that that was a reasonable way to send out Radio Australia news and current affairs into this regionâabsolutely ridiculous.</para><para>Senator Abetz went on to say that it would be anti-Christian to keep broadcasting Radio Australia from Cox. Actually, I expected him to react to that because that was a misrepresentation of his views, but he is trying to pretend that he is not listening to me. They are talking amongst themselves over there, but Senator Abetz should be paying attention. The point is that I have misrepresented your views, Senator Abetz, and I have done so because you misrepresented mineâand probably the views of an awful lot of people. You said that my views were offensive to those 70 to 80 per cent of Australians who identify themselves with the Christian faith. Speaking as one of those 70 to 80 per cent of Australians who identify themselves with the Christian faith, I can tell you that my views are not offensive to myself. And my views are not offensive to Senator Woodley, who was a minister of religion in the Christian faith, or to a lot of other people who identify themselves with the Christian faith. So I think you are wrong there, and I think it was a huge misrepresentation of my views. You really should apologise, but I am sure you are not going to. </para><para>You said that you believed in freedom of speech. Good, I am glad to hear that. I do too. I believe that freedom of speech means that people who want to hear news and current affairs about their own countries and who want to hear it on short wave, as they have done for the last 50 years, should be able to do it. That should be something which they have as a right and which we should provide for them. I remember that when we had the first debate about Radio Australia there was a plan A. Plan A was that the government wanted it turned off altogetherâI am sure we all remember plan A. And I remember plan Bâno more short wave; we will just have satellite. That, of course, meant that you would not get a signal to a small, easily bought and easily transported receiver. Then there was plan C, which is where we are at the moment, and now we are waiting for plan D. Senator Abetz is leavingâI am not really surprised at all. We were sitting here, waiting in hope for plan D, and many of us, including people on the government's own side, honestly believed that this government could not possibly be so stupid as to turn off short-wave Radio Australia into Asia, which has done so much good. But guess whatâeven those people on the government's side were wrong. This government could be that stupid. This government has been that stupid. This government has done it.</para><para>Let us go back to Senator Bishop's motion, which is an excellent motion. Senator Bishop starts off by deploring the loss of the Cox Peninsula transmitter in 1997 when it was turned off and the more recent sale of the transmitter to a foreign interest group. I deplore that as well. I think he is absolutely right in deploring that loss, and I am not alone. Several committees of this parliament have also deplored the loss of the transmitter, committees such as the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and Senate committees like the communications committee. We deplore the loss of that transmitterâand that is not just members of the Democrats or members of the Labor Party. Members of the Liberal Party and the National Party also deplore the loss of that transmitter. Over the several years since 1997, there have been many letters to the government and many recommendations from committees of this parliament to this government, requesting that Cox Peninsula be given back to Radio Australia and that Radio Australia be able to send out news, current affairs and all its other programs into Asia and the Pacific. So I am not alone there. </para><para>When it was turned off in 1997, there were also letters from about six heads of state. They sent letters to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying, `Please don't turn off the Cox Peninsula Radio Australia transmitter that broadcasts into Asia. This is a service which is very valuable. This is a service that we want in our countries.' Six heads of state made that plea. Did we do anything about it? No, we ignored them, which just goes to show what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs think about our region and the heads of state in the region. But it was not just heads of state who complained; it was ordinary people from around the region. Thousands of people from China, Vietnam, Indonesia and other countries wrote to this government saying, `Please do not turn off the short-wave service of Radio Australia into Asia.' So what did the government do? Did it listen to them? Did it respond to them? Did it do anything at all? Yes, it did somethingâit made sure that the short-wave service did not go back into Asia. And now it is assiduously trying to make sure that it never goes back into Asia. I have asked several questions this week about this sale. One question that I have asked twice of Senator Alston is: are you going to fund Radio Australia to continue to broadcast in short wave into Asia? And I have received no answer at all. I therefore assume that the answer is no, they are not going to fund it.</para><para>It does not take much. Radio Australia costs $1.4 million a year to run by short wave into Asia. I imagine it costs more to hire transmitters from elsewhere to do it. They are not our own transmitters, so we are having to pay a higher premium. However, it would not cost that much more because $1.4 million got us a huge range and five stations. We are not looking for anything like that anymore. Unfortunately, our expectations have now been diminished drastically and very unsatisfactorilyâtragically is probably the correct term. Therefore, it is not going to cost us very much more than $1.4 million, which it cost us before 1997, to keep that transmitter open and to keep five channels open broadcasting in different languages throughout Asia. It would not cost us that much more. Are the government going to give us the $1.4 million? Are they going to give Radio Australia or the ABC that $1.4 million? Relatively speaking it is not an awful lot of moneyâ$1.4 million for all that good. Are they going to give it to them? No. They are telling us that, no, they cannot find $1.4 million for that. They can find other money for other things. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThey found $431 million for GST ads.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>âThe GST ads are another question, aren't they, Senator Carr? I would probably agree with you on many of those, and I think several of my colleagues would agree with me. They can find that sort of money. They can find a lot of money for a lot of things, but can they find $1.4 million to put back Australia's reputation in Asia? No, they cannot, and they do not intend to look for it. That is the message I am getting. I hope that is wrong. I look forward to the minister ringing me up and saying, `Vicki, you are wrong. Of course we can find this $1.4 million. Of course we are going to go out and make sure Radio Australia is in short wave. Of course we are going to do that.'

There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence that came to the Senate standing committee when we were looking into the future of Radio Australia, which looked pretty bleak at the time, in 1997. It looks an awful lot more bleak now. There was an awful lot of anecdotal evidence and an awful lot of evidence that came from letters from people in Asia, mostly in South-East Asia and southern China, about how their view of Australia was coloured by them listening to Radio Australia. These are people who learned English by listening to Radio Australia. These are people who learned about what was going on in their own country and believed it because they knew Radio Australia was a reliable source of news and current affairs. These are people who knew they were not going to get that information anymore. They were not going to get it from BBC World Service, they were not going to get it from Deutsche Welle, they were not going to get it from Voice of America and they were not going to get it from Voice of Malaysia or Singapore. They do not get this information. Guess who they trusted? Guess who had the highest listening audience? Yes, it was Radio Australia.</para><para>Very recently the BBC did a survey of how many people listen to short wave and what short wave they listen to in Indonesia. This was in Indonesia alone. Pre-1997, when the Cox Peninsula transmitter was turned off to Radio Australia, Radio Australia had by far the highest listening audience. Two years ago it went down to its lowest: it was a quarter of what it was when Radio Australia was turned on. It has gone up a little bit but it is still not up to half, and they are wondering whether it will ever go up any further until short wave is turned back on. It is demonstrably obvious that short wave is the way that Asian people listen to their news and the way they listened to Radio Australia. They liked doing it. They enjoyed listening to Radio Australia. It was part of their day. It taught them English. It gave them a view of Australia that was positive. It gave them a view of their own region of the world that they relied on and that they knew was right. It told them things that their own governments did not want them to know, and they liked that. </para><para>We have been given several reasons by this government for why Radio Australia has been turned off into Asia. The first one, from Senator Alston, was, `Short wave is a dead technology. Nobody listens to short wave anymore.' Of course, it is booming. It is booming all over this region because you can buy cheap receivers and then you can go out into the field or go to your place of work and you can turn it on and you can listen to it. It is very difficult for governments that do not like what is being said to block short wave. It is very difficult indeed. So people would listen to it at home and they would listen to it in the workplace. Short wave is a really good technology for this region. We were told by Senator Alston that short wave was a dead technology. Guess what? He was wrong. We were told that satellite was taking over. It is not. We were told that people would rather listen to it via satellite because it was a better signal. Yes, it is a better signal, but most people do not have the reception equipment for that, particularly the ordinary people of Asia. My absolute favourite reason that was given to us for why Radio Australia should be turned offâthe most brilliant one that the government has ever come up withâwas: we should not be telling people in Asia what their own governments do not want them to know.

The facilities at Cox Peninsula were closed amid a huge outcry both here and abroad. Cox Peninsula transmitter was closed against the advice of all the experts on Asian affairs and international relations within this country. It was closed against the wishes of a huge, loyal and longstanding audience of Radio Australia in Indonesia, in China and in other countries, as well as in East Timor. I repeat, Senator McGauran: our signal cannot be heard in Timor, and that is a disgrace. It cannot be heard in East Timor as a direct result of the action taken by this government. The government has effectively silenced this country in many homes throughout Asia. Radio Australia was once a crucial medium for communication in Asia, where millions of people simply cannot afford a television set, cannot provide Internet connections and cannot afford the satellite communication which the government claims is now the replacement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In remote regions, short-wave radio is the only means of communications. Before the closure of Cox Peninsula, Radio Australia afforded this country a listening audience in Asia and the opportunity to have a reliable, unbiased, secular, uncensored radio service. It was often broadcast in the languages of the people the signal was sent to. It covered news and current affairs of relevance to their countries. It may not have been popular with all governments in the region. It may not always have been popular with various governments within this country. It may not have met the requirements of various officials in Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it was acknowledged by the people throughout the region to be a reliable, unbiased, uncensored radio service which was able to provide accurate information about what was actually going on. While it may not have been liked by governments, it certainly was regarded fondly by the peoples of the region.</para><para>Radio Australia reached out to millions of people who were hungry for information and entertainment. It taught English to countless people through its famous language courses. One person who has been drawn to my attention on the issue of communicating and educating people is Mau Huno, a great leader of the independence struggle in East Timor. He took up the reins after the imprisonment of Xanana Gusmao by the Indonesians in 1991. Before his death, he was able to speak English fluently. As the leader of Falantil, you might ask how it was that he was able to develop that skill. It was through Radio Australia. The leader of the Timorese resistance may well have felt isolated during many dark hours of that struggle, but through Radio Australia he could reach out to his friends in other parts of the world.</para><para>Radio Australia had a broadcast capacity which reached an estimated 18.4 million people in Asia and the Pacific. In Indonesia, Radio Australia's audience was over 8Â½ million, with more than two million regular listeners. That in itself represents a major advantage to this country and a great opportunity for this country to communicate with the people of our nearest neighbour. Through this reach of the station we have seen capacity to express a view about what this country stands for. It represents all of us in that capacity. In recent times, we have seen that reach decimated. Throughout most of Indonesia and, as I say, Timor you cannot receive Radio Australia today. I have some information here that goes particularly to this issue of the capacity of Radio Australia to be heard. The minister says, `Well, we have a series of rebroadcast stations operating throughout the region.' I am told that there are some 51 stations that take Radio Australia in Asia. But, Senator McGauran, you ought to be aware of this: only three of those 51 stations, which of course broadcast in local languages, take Radio Australia news. Even where our signal is being rebroadcast, it is minus all the bits that actually make it important and very worth while. In terms of the minister's claim that there are increasing rates of people taking up Internet connections, the fact remains that that does not have a significant impact in terms of the availability of that technology within the countries in our region. </para><para>In Cambodia, we see a similar pattern being exhibited. On this issue of rebroadcast, we notice from a recent surveyâRadio Australia did not actually have the money to undertake it themselves and they bought it off someone else, so it may not be strictly speaking comparable to the figures published in the Senate report in May 1997âthat in Cambodia at the time of the survey no Khmer language news and current affairs was being rebroadcast by local stations because of the political pressures that have been brought to bear. We can see the same pattern being exhibited throughout the region. That ought to be understood by government senators if they have any real interest in what the political impact of this decision has been.</para><para>Radio Australia provides a news service which, on balance, concentrates on events in the Asia-Pacific region, unlike the BBC or the American short-wave services which have a much broader interest and do not necessarily reflect the interests of our region explicitly. Another reason we ought to be concerned about this issue which has been demonstrated in recent days is our capacity to communicate not just with the peoples of the region but with Australians in the region. We have seen the situation in Fiji and in the Solomons in recent times. I acknowledge that our Pacific reach is quite good, and that point has been made in the contributions here this afternoon. The government has spent money on Shepparton facilities to make sure that the Pacific region is well catered for. This highlights the need that exists. Many parts of the region are in constant turmoil. There is a particular political need for us to ensure that we have the capacity in times of unrest to make sure that we can communicate with our citizens. We have the unfortunate circumstances, for instance in Indonesia, where there is a need for us to be able to express the views of the government. Where evacuation issues come about, it is critical for us to have the capacity to provide advice to citizens concerning evacuation plans and the like. It goes beyond the cultural issues. It goes beyond the issues we have talked about this afternoon in terms of trade. It goes beyond presenting a positive image of this country to our neighbours. It goes to very practical concerns about the safety of Australians.</para><para>All of this is old ground. A new group of people is taking over the facility on Cox Peninsula. It has been leased out to a foreign private organisation. I might say that the discussion I have heard this afternoon quite disturbs me. The government emphasises what it believes to be the value for money that it has received in terms of the assets of Radio Australiaâas if we can reduce the reputation of this country to a mere commodity exchange. This government takes a fundamentally different view to the issue of our reputation and our strategic interest from the view of many other governments in the world. I notice, for instance, the British government has recently restated the simple proposition that the BBC World Service is an institution of enormous strategic importance to the British government. However, in Australia the government is quite easily able to sell the equipment of Radio Australia to a foreign private organisation.</para><para>It is not just any foreign private organisation, for that matter. The transmitter is being rented out to a religious organisation based in the United Kingdom known as Christian Vision. Senator Abetz is concerned to defend evangelical groups and it is his right to do that. However, I think it is important to emphasise that there would be very few senators in this place who would not acknowledge the right of persons to believe any religious philosophy they want to follow, and their freedom to express that. But there are other issues that need to be considered when it comes to the question of whether or not this particular group is able to represent effectively Australia's voice within the region. That is what this is all aboutâthe implications of this government's sale of the facilities at Cox Point to this particular group of people. It is important that we understand that no foreign organisation, religious or otherwise, automatically has the capacity to impose a view which can be represented as the views of the people of this country. </para><para>I see, for instance, that today the Prime Minister is likely to meet the President of Indonesia, President Wahid. This is long overdue. For many months there has been a tremendous chill in the relationship between this country and Indonesia, a chill which should not have been allowed to go on for as long as it has. There will be a falling out with Indonesia from time to time. I recall that in the early 1990s Australian journalists were banned from Indonesia. And, of course, there have been problems with Malaysia at various times throughout the last decade. I think it is important that we mend our bridges with Asia. It is important that we maintain our ties and strengthen our channels of communication wherever we possibly can without denying fundamental human rights or the differences that exist between our cultures and societies. </para><para>The broadcasts in English by and large have to be of a quality that ensures that the sorts of values this society represents are communicated effectively throughout the region. I am, however, concerned about any prospect of provocation in regard to conflicts that occur within the region. For those purposes we must understand that, whatever one's religious views, there has to be some acknowledgment that there are responsibilities that go beyond the mere expression of a sense of one's place in the world. Equally, for Muslim groups there exist the same sorts of obligations in terms of working within the region. </para><para>The government has been speaking recently on a bill before the parliament, the <inline ref="R984">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999.</inline> This bill was introduced on 9 December last year. It is intended to establish a new licensing regime to govern foreign broadcasters transmitting from Australia, such foreign broadcasters as Christian Vision. I am sure that there are many problems which will have to be dealt with when the bill finally gets to the Senate. The bill is clearly intended to ensure that foreign broadcasters operating out of Australia do no harm to our national interests. Mr McGauran, the minister for the arts, said in his second reading speech: </para><quote><para>This new regulatory regime will provide a licensing framework for international broadcasting services transmitting from Australia whilst safeguarding Australia's interest. </para></quote><para>If the government were serious in its intentions as expressed in this bill, it would have ensured that the bill was in law at the moment. I would have thought it would not have leased the Cox Peninsula facility to the Christian Vision organisation without the bill being in place. Senator Abetz has particular religious views. He has an ill-informed, ignorant, authoritarian attitude towards those who do not share his particular sense of morality and his particular notion of what is Christian and what is not. I might say that it is an offensive view to many more than the 20 per cent of Australians who do not necessarily directly share a Christian viewâhighly offensive, I would have thought, to the Islamic and Jewish communities in this country and to those who do not share his particular notions of worship.</para><para>Christian Vision says in its statement of its core beliefs and tenets that people who are not Christians will suffer `everlasting conscious punishment'. Perhaps it is a view that Senator Abetz would agree with. This is an organisation which is particularly serious about its views on conversion and about its notions of what Christianity is all about. I would have thought they were views that not all mainstream organisations within the Christian churches would necessarily have much in common with. Given the vehemence with which the views are expressed, it presents a problem for us within the region.  </para><para>Australia is part of a world community. A transmitter facility in Australia ought not be used in a way that undermines our national interest and that does not meet the national interest of Australians as a broad community. As citizens within this region we have a right to express views and to live in common harmony with our neighbours. Professor Kenneth McPherson, the Director of the Indian Ocean Research Centre, wrote to the minister for communications on 31 January 1997. He said: </para><quote><para>Radio Australia ... is a formidable ally in our attempts to develop sustainable relations with our near neighbours. The alienation of Radio Australia from the custom-built Cox Peninsula transmission facility is a tragedy, but one that could have been reversed. </para></quote><para>The leasing out of the same facilities to a particular international broadcaster, in my judgment, is a disaster for this country of potentially huge proportions. To rely upon facilities in other countries to get our signal out, equally, is a misfortune that we should do something about. The reliance by this government on a particular ideological view of what is good for this region is, equally, a disaster. The actions of this government ought to be deplored. They betray Australia's national interest and confirm to the listeners the lack of interest of the Australian government in the Asian region and convey an attempt by the Australian government to nullify an Australian voice to the region. </para><para>I support the motion that is before the Senate today. I urge the Australian government to take all necessary steps to ensure that Radio Australia regains immediate access to the transmitter. I call on the Australian government to make sufficient funds available immediately so that Radio Australia can access that transmitter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15009</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLabor's indignation over the fate of the Cox Peninsula transmitter is yet another indication of the opposition's preference for the symbolic over the practical and for rhetoric over substance.

He did not discover Asia; Labor did not discover Asiaâthe coalition did.

The coalition has a very proud history of engagement in Asiaâone that significantly predates the Labor Party's newfound devotion to regionalism. It was the foreign minister in the Menzies government, Richard Caseyâlater Lord Caseyâwho, during the 1950s, set Australia on the road to building lasting ties with our Asian neighbours. It was Casey who normalised relations with Japan after World War II and who, of course, established friendly relations with Indonesia. It was Casey who presided over Australia's entry into the South East Asia Collective Defence TreatyâSEATO. While he believed in maintaining close ties with our traditional allies, it is what he said that perhaps underpins the entire debate today and summarises foreign policy in this country: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Our special role, however, lies in Asia and the Pacific, and consequently our foreign policy is largely but not exclusively concerned with that region.</para></quote><para>He said that more 40 years ago, a long time before <inline font-style="italic">Engagement: Australia faces the Asia Pacific</inline> by Mr Keating.</para><para>Reflecting Casey's sentiments, our commitment to security of the region has been longstanding and paramount from World War II through the Korean War, the Malaysian emergency, the Indonesian confrontation, Vietnam, and recently to restoring peace in Cambodia and, of course, in East Timor. It was the coalition that ended the White Australia policy and, of course, welcomed Asian refugees in the 1970s. I mentioned in an adjournment debate a while ago that the greatest stain on the Labor Party's immigration policiesâborne out by John Menadue's recent autobiographyâwas the fact that the Whitlam government did not want to take Vietnamese immigrants after the conclusion of the Vietnam War. I notice Senator Schacht has gone very quiet. The most disgraceful act of the Labor Partyâand John Menadue agrees with this, Senator Schacht, as you knowâwas that they did not want to take Vietnamese refugees after the conclusion of the Vietnam War.

It unfolded against an environment of crisis and upheaval of which there are only a few parallels in the postwar period. It was easy and convenient for Mr Hawke and Mr Keating to talk about engagement in Asia in an environment of great prosperity in Asia. This government has had to engage in regionalism and in increasing our ties with Asia in the difficult environment of the Asian economic meltdown. It has been a much more difficult periodâindeed, in very recent times, with the political crises in Fiji and the Solomon Islands. This government has faced those challenges with determination and deep commitment, and not just simply vocalised our interest in some abstract but proved our engagement in very practical and outcome-orientated ways.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When Asian countries suffered economic meltdown and social upheaval, Australia again was thereânot with words and platitudes but with concrete assistance. We have participated in all three International Monetary Fund second-tier support arrangements for Indonesia, Korea and Thailand. The government's commitment to our Asian neighbours in their darkest hour of need totalled $3 billion. We have worked behind the scenes to secure and to extend international assistance in a more coordinated and better targeted way and on more sensible and more helpful terms. Again, when Indonesia recently suffered political crisis, Australia was there with strong support for a peaceful, democratic transformation of our near neighbour. We have provided technical and financial assistance for Indonesia's first truly democratic elections in 40 years. Indonesia is now the world's third largest democracy, and Australia has made a valuable contribution to that outcome.</para><para>Soon after, when the region was again engulfed in crisis over the future of East Timor, Australia displayed courage and leadership in an attempt to solve the regional problem that has strained relations and defied resolution for the past quarter century. The Prime Minister's diplomatic pressure on Indonesia to conduct a referendum in East Timor and to abide by its outcome, and his decisionâindeed, this parliament's decisionâto send Australian peacekeepers to the island have done infinitely more to guarantee self-determination, safety and the well-being of East Timorese people than anything that Mr Whitlam, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating ever did in all their years of silent acquiescence. As the foreign minister, Mr Downer, said, there is a `cultural regionalism' which is `built on common ties of history, of mutual identity'. It is debatable, however, to what extent that sort of regionalism is applicable to Australia's dealings with her neighbours. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name></talker><para>âI hear an interjection.

I will get to the Cox Peninsula in a second. I really wanted to outline the context and the hypocrisy of the Labor Party's stance. There is, however, a practical regionalism where, as the Foreign Minister reminds us, `countries which are bound together by geography find practical ways of working together to achieve their mutual objectives.' Australia, under the Howard government, has certainly demonstrated its commitment to this practical regionalism. In four years in office, this government has worked tirelessly to build stronger bilateral relations with the region's governments. Last year alone, Chinese, Korean, Singaporean and Vietnamese leaders visited our country. This year the Prime Minister has visited Korea and is currently in Japan, where he will have talks with Indonesian President Wahid.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But we have not forgotten the importance of multilateral ties.

In the macro, we might well say that the introduction of the GST and the cutbacks to education and health are the worst decisions but, as an individual decision, I cannot think of any that is more narrow minded or more against the national interests of Australia than this decision to gut Radio Australia and to end up with the bizarre consequence whereby, in the last 10 days, the government has flogged off the Cox Peninsula facility for a yet undisclosed sum to a foreign organisation that may well not broadcast material that is in the national interests of Australia.</para><para>I think it was two years ago that Senator Forshaw, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, produced a strong report.

I just want to get it on the record: how did this government get to make this crazy decision? How did they get to make it themselves? Because of their obsession and hatred for the ABC, when they came to office they announced, before the first budget and before any examination, that they were cutting $50 million a year off the budget of the ABC. They announced it first and then they said, `Oops, we'd better try to justify that,' so they appointed Bob Mansfield to go and conduct an inquiry.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>In his report tabled in parliament, Mr Mansfield pointed out that he had had something like, I think, 11,000 or 14,000 submissions made to him by people in Australia defending the ABC.

I think the minister admitted in estimates that he himself had received a similar number of letters of protestâwell over 10,000âat what he was doing to the ABC. But I do not blame Mr Mansfield, because he was given terms of reference that meant he had to find how a saving of $50 million could be introduced. Because of the terms of reference, which had an emphasis on domestic broadcasting, he came up with the only recommendation that he could see would save the money, which was to gut and abolish Radio Australia to make a savingâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âAnd ATV.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âYes, and Australian Television going into Asia. But the main thing that he could see was, unfortunately, to get rid of Radio Australia. There was some quasi-evidence put up by the government that technology meant that short-wave radio was no longer relevant in the region and that the Internet and digital broadcasting would replace it all. The government were then stuck. This was the only way they could get the $50 million saving. So, shamefacedly, they had to announce the gutting of Radio Australia. I think Mr Downer and probably Tim Fischer and a couple of others argued, `You can't abolish it completely; let's leave us with something.' So a few odd million were left. But they gutted the staff numbersâmost of the resources were gone. It was said that Cox Peninsula was too expensive to operate at $1 million a year and it was closed down and put into mothballs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course, there was a reaction particularly all round our region about this decision. Over the last 10 days, the final, obscene outcome of this decision has been seen: the government has had to lease the Cox Peninsula facility to a foreign organisation that may not have the interests of Australia at heart but will use the facility that the taxpayers of Australia have paid tens of millions of dollars to develop. As I understand it, from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, the Australian government, the Hawke-Keating Labor governments, spent close to $30 million on Cox Peninsula to upgrade and develop it so that a strong signal would go into the region of our interest, the Asia-Pacific. As soon as it was finished, this government closed it down and the taxpayers' money has been overwhelmingly wasted.</para><para>We have yet to be given any details of how much the leasing arrangement is worth. As I understand it from some speculation in the press, this religious organisation from Great Britain has bought the equipment but has leased the land. That means they may well have walked off with several tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment, at a cheap price, that the Australian taxpayers have paid for. They have then leased the land. The government are now suggesting, `We might be able to reach an arrangement whereby they'll let us put some Radio Australia signal on.' What a demeaning outcome! We now have to go cap in hand to this organisation and ask, `Please let Radio Australia have some time.' But it is up to them to make that decision. That is demeaning. How any government could demean itself to do that is beyond me.</para><para>My colleagues have spoken so well today about the gutting of Radio Australia. In the turmoil that is in Asia at the moment and in the Pacific, why would you not want to have an independent Radio Australia broadcasting the information, the news and the current affairs that is recognised as being unbiased, even if at times, of course, it was critical of the Australian government? But that gave Radio Australia its reputation of truth, honesty and, over a period of time, of balance. Of course some countries in Asia do not like that. Some countries in the South Pacific do not like that. It is usually those countries that have something to hide of an antidemocratic nature or on the human rights front that do not like some of that criticism. But that is why Radio Australia had standing and credibility. </para><para>There are only two international radio broadcasters into the Asia-Pacific region that I am aware of that have standing and credibility. One of them is the BBC Overseas Service; the other is Radio Australia. Every other broadcaster from another nation people recognise as pushing the particular line of their own government. But Radio Australia, because of its unique structure, operated by independent journalists within the ABC Charter, has never had that criticism. Therefore, it was listened to by tens of millions of people throughout the region. That credibility is something we should cherish. It has served Australia well in the past and will do so long into the future.</para><para>Some people in Asia say that they do not like to be hectored or lectured by Radio Australia reporting stories and giving comments from those who are in favour of such things as human rights. I have to say that if that upsets some governments in Asia, so be it. Most ordinary Australians would support the promotion of human rights, human dignity and the democratic form of government. In 1991, I led a human rights delegation to China. We went to Tibet. In Tibet, the Chinese government has, to say the least, conducted a severe regime that has culturally oppressed the Tibetan people. There have been many reports and comments in this parliament about that over many years. When we were there, there was no reporting of our visit by the Chinese official media. We were non-people; we were a non-delegation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âUnfortunately, Mr Nehl and others have made some rather unfortunate remarks, not to the advantage of the Australian people or to human rights.

I made sure of that when I led the delegation. When this person made some private contacts, they said, `Oh yes, we know who you are. We know you are the delegation from Australia looking at human rights in Tibet. We are very pleased that you have shown the interest to come and see the condition of Tibet and the Tibetan people.' Our delegation member asked, `How do you know that we are here? There has been no mention in the Chinese press at all.' They said, `Of course we know you're here. We listen to Radio Australia and the BBC Overseas Service. That is where we get information that we can rely on about the wider world and what is happening with respect to people around the world supporting us in our quest for human rights and a more democratic system in Tibet.' I have to say that I do not care whether it costs us $5 million or $20 million a year to run Radio Australia. If some people in an area being oppressed by any form of undemocratic government find that they can get information that helps them in their campaign for human rights, that is a price worth paying. But what is this government doing? It is closing down the means by which that message can be broadcast. That information can be broadcast to people not only in Tibet but in Burma and other places where there is turmoil right now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is what I find so disgusting about this single decision of this government to gut Radio Australia.

When that bill came before the legislative committee, we heard a number of reasons why it would be a good regime. I have to say that, no matter how you do itâno matter how you draw it upâin the end some bureaucrats in some organisation will make a judgment on whether this group or that group should broadcast from Australia. Once you get into that subjective area, sooner or later there will be dispute over the subjective judgments made and why it is so. That has been brought about because of the void left by Radio Australia, and others think they can step into it and use the facilities.</para><para>The organisation that has won the right to broadcast from Australia has been described in a number of editorials as either a Christian fundamentalist group or a religious fundamentalist group. I admire them in one sense; they have actually been quite open in describing the message that they want to put out. I will quote them. Christian Vision's website describes the group as a `charitable company that God has challenged to touch a billion people with the message of Jesus through the use of media'. Its listed beliefs including `the everlasting conscious bliss of all who truly believe in our Lord Jesus Christ and that everlasting conscious punishment is the portion of all whose names are not written in the Book of Life'.</para><para>I am an absolute supporter of free speech. If people want to distribute that sort of message around Australia, that is fine, but if they put it on the transmitter that was once owned by the Australian government, no matter how we explain it in Asia, it will be seen as having the imprimatur of being a view that the Australian government may hold. We can go up hill and down dale saying it is not so, but they will think we are for it. </para><para>I am also worried that, now we have given this group the right to use Radio Australia or to buy it, we will be back on the old treadmill. If, say, a Muslim group bids to use it, and we say, `No, you can't use it; we have given it to the Christian group,' there will be arguments that you are showing religious partiality. That is what really concerns me. It would concern me in the case of any organisation with a religious background. It would also concern me if we gave it away to a political party or any other group that has a political agenda. We would not do that. We would say that that would be stupid; that it is not in our national interest. This government has established a principleâa precedentâthat is going to come back to haunt us. Why wouldn't people in our region, who are overwhelmingly not of the Christian belief, ask, `What are you doing in Australia? Do you believe that your national interest lies in proselytising Christianity in an area where a couple of billion people are not of that faith?' I think that, in the national interest, we always should stick to the old principle of the separation of the state from religion and religion from the state.</para><para>What we have done here is muddy the situation by the absolute bungling of the government in handling this. If Radio Australia uses the transmitter run by this Christian group to broadcast, that means that the Christian group will be seen as having some involvement with Radio Australia. Do they then have the right to turn the transmitter off when they do not like hearing something going out on their leased transmitter? All of those issues can start arising.

You come in here defending Radio Australia's role when you could not even defend it when you were in government. You never gave it a priority when you were in government. So your genuineness is non-existent.</para><para>Senator Sherry interjected and mentioned Senator Bourne. Senator Bourne has been on this issue all week. To her credit, she has moved off her first question on Monday, because it was a disgraceful question, as Senator Abetz highlighted. She asked a question about Radio Australia of Minister Alston on Tuesday, Wednesday and today. To her credit, they were on the issue, but on Monday she was way off the issue. In fact, anyone who reads the question she asked will know that she was in fact questioning the sale of the Cox Peninsula transmission facility to the evangelical broadcaster Christian Voice. She was highlighting whom we sold it to more than anything else. She asked whether Foreign Affairs had investigated this group, what sort of message they intended, what sort of influence they would haveâall sorts of questions like that, based around whom it was sold to rather than the sale itself.  </para><para>All in all, with the genuineness of Senator Schacht, the genuineness and misinformation of Senator Carrâand he can go back and double check if he likes, because I have checked it out completelyâand with Senator Bourne's rather intolerant and inappropriate question on Monday and, of course, the contribution generally of the Labor Party itself, there is no genuineness to this debate at all. Time does not permit me to say much more other than to say that you would think, listening to the Labor Party, that we were closing down Radio Australia.

This loophole was engineered by the Liberal Party. Greenfields was, and still may be, part of their shonky fundraising apparatus. First, some history. In 1995 the then Liberal Party treasurer, Ron Walker, guaranteed the Liberal Party's $4.6 million debt to the National Australia Bank. That debt was then assigned to the mysterious Greenfields Foundation, a so-called charitable foundation. The Liberal Party has made only token repayments of the loan. A loan to a political party in itself is not a problemâthe problem arises from the fact that the Greenfields Foundation can collect substantial donations from sources which remain anonymous for the purposes of funding disclosure. That money is then forwarded to the Liberal Party in the form of a loan. What remains unanswered is: when will the loan be repaid, how will it be repaid, how is the funding secured and are there any concessional interest rate arrangements in the financing? We do know that the Liberal Party has made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. The money may not have been a repayment but rather a grant to set up the foundation. However, even if this is a repayment on a loan, it is at a very lucrative rate of about 2Â½ per cent. This would not be a loan on a commercial basis. </para><para>Quite rightly, the Electoral Commission has now found the Greenfields Foundation to be an associated entity of the Liberal Party. It now has to supply returns to the AEC. But it has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table. Both the Liberal Party and the shadowy Greenfields Foundation do not want to be accountable. They both tried to hide. The AEC had to issue notices to the Greenfields Foundation to force it to come clean. Even then, it has tried to weasel out of properly disclosing its relationship with and funding to the Liberal Party. Naturally, the Electoral Commission was concerned about the uncommonly favourable manner in which the Greenfields Foundation treated the Liberals' debt to it, and it found that Greenfields's `lenient treatment of the Liberal Party in servicing the debt represented a benefit to the party'. The report states that `a person, or in certain circumstances a corporation' could avoid disclosures by `a series of transactions based on the Greenfields model'. It recommends that the loophole be closed `as a matter of priority'. </para><para>Labor, and particularly my colleague Senator Faulkner, has been arguing for three years that this loophole be properly closed. The AEC has to take at face value Mr Walker's assertion that he personally covered the $4.6 million debt, but the AEC warns that `should the creditor not have any individual disclosure obligations, for instance, as an associated entity, the identity of the guarantor, the real source of the funds, need not be disclosed anywhere'. In other words, the Liberal Party have engineered a mechanism to hide the identity of its political donors. The Labor Party gives in-principle support to the Electoral Commission's recommendations to declare a loan as a gift so that paper trails can be followed to find the actual political donors of so-called loans. Mr Howard is happy, or he was at least up until today, to use the private information of 12 million voters from the electoral roll for a GST mail-out, but the AEC's report proves that, when it comes to the Liberal Party's own political activities regarding what are in substance donations, they will go to any lengths to cover up people's identities. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>15018</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is very disappointing to see that the Liberal Party are prepared to go to such outrageous lengths to hide their donors.

I think they were thenâand at other times if not most timesâwithin proper bounds. We had a situation in 1994-95 where the national office of the Liberal Party, as happens to political parties of all persuasions, was in serious financial trouble. The Treasurer of the Liberal Party at the time, Mr Ron Walker, was given the task of remedying that. As far as we are concerned, he is quite entitled to do so, provided he acts within the law. What occurred was thatâat least by his own admission, but we have no proof of itâhe anteed up the $4.6 million himself. But, to disguise that donation, it was assigned to the Greenfields Foundation. Note that it is not a registered company but a foundation. It was done at no interest at all. So far as we can detect, the Liberal Party has only repaid $200,000 of that debt. This was basically a device to avoid the provisions of the Electoral Act. That should not surprise us because from 1983 onwards the Liberal Party of Australia has sought to knock over disclosure provisions. It has voted against nearly every piece of legislation on disclosure from 1983 through to the current day. But you have to ask yourself: why would Mr Walker want to avoid disclosure? Surely, if he is putting in $4.6 million he should be proud of it; he should be a hero in the Liberal Party. But what you have to look at at the same time is this: what other activities was Mr Walker involved in? He was heavily involved through HudCon and his partner Mr Williams in the Victorian casino bid.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not going to regurgitate all the details here other than to say how amazing it was that, in the second round bidding, they were able to lift their bid by 40 per cent to exactly equal the bid of the other group that was involved. Then, when they started to get into trouble, their licence was expanded: more gaming machines were given than they were entitled to. Certain obligations in terms of theatres and hotel towers were reneged onâagain they were forgiven. It is this juxtaposition between the favourable treatment of Mr Walker's group compared with the others, in conjunction with this hidden donation, that required the Electoral Commission, I think, to examine these questions in detail. The Electoral Commission have taken a long time to bring down this report but we must acknowledge that once they got their skates on they did it thoroughly. It is a pity they did not give other issues equal consideration. It is a pity that it was only through the estimates process that we discovered, for instance, their $10 million mail-out that they were assisting the tax office in. They had never given that proper attention. They were able to breach their act, according to the Solicitor-General today, in several waysâand you have to ask: why were they allowed to get away with it? This Greenfields issue has still got a long way to go. It is the most blatant example of a political party and its treasurer trying to avoid disclosure at all times. In the end it needs to be further investigated whether it was in fact Mr Walker who came up with the $4.6 million or the source of the money was elsewhere, be it overseas or some other business groups in Australia.

It may be said that there is some excuse for the delays that occur in regard to the vocational education bills, because it might be said that there is some need to talk to the states about it, but there is no excuse for the delays with a heap of billsâthe higher education funding bills and the Australian Research Council bills.

I think we are entitled to ask the minister: where is the bill? Why is this legislation being held upâa $15 billion bill? We ought to have an opportunity to peruse it properly. We ought to have an opportunity to examine it carefully and we ought to have an opportunity to ensure that it does the things that this government claims it is going to do. We have not seen the $15 billion bill: it has been held back because this government, I believe, wants to drop it on us at the last minute, go to the various schools around the country and say, `Look, the reason you haven't got your money is the Labor Party is holding up the bill.' The government is holding up the billâthat is the truth of the matter.</para><para>I would like to turn to this particular report. If you look at these reports over the years, you get a very good understanding of the changes that occur within governments in terms of their approaches to education. Every year the Commonwealth, states and territories have reported on equity measures. What we see in this report, however, is a very marked differential from previous years. Comparisons between the years are often difficult with some years because particular equity groups have been given particular attention; they have received greater attentionâfor instance, indigenous groups in 1997, and in 1996 there were isolated students and various other things.</para><para>Each of these reports has not been able to provide continuing, comparable data, and this report continues that trend. So we have a situation where, frankly, it is not possible to clearly identify the changes that are occurring in specific programs that are being followed by governments. For example, the table `National equity program for schools, funding by program, sector and state', which was published in 1995 and 1996, has not been compiled for 1997 or 1998. Instead, we have states reporting on equity measures in ad hoc manners which cannot be compared with one another. If we look at resourcing issues, it is abundantly clear what this government is seeking to do and what its priorities are. For the first time since 1989, the 1998 schools report has not included a chapter on resourcing Australian schools. Furthermore, the number of tables on resourcing has decreased from 21 in 1997 to 11 in 1998. Significant tables missing from the 1998 report are, for instance, `Per student expenditure of non-government schools by affiliation and level of education by State' and the `Income and expenditure per student of all non-government schools by affiliation, by state'. These tables are quite significant but they are missing from this report. </para><para>These tables are compiled by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs here in Canberra, and the department's spokesmen are only too happy to tell people that these figures were not available at the time of publication. We want to ask, and we are entitled to know, why these tablesâwhich I understand are now availableâwere not provided on time. We are entitled to know why this report was held up by this government so that it could include its literacy benchmarking results, which, in the end, were reported as supplements to the report. We are entitled to ask why these reports are presented in such a shoddy manner and why the government seeks to hide so much of the information relating to important issues like literacy, numeracy and the equity objectives of Australian education. It is quite apparent that this government is seeking to prevent this information being made available to Australians at large. Education remains of fundamental importance to this country, and it ought to be treated much more seriously by this government.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>15020</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to reports of the Auditor-General were considered:</para><quote><para>Audit report No. 43 of 1999-2000âPerformance auditâPlanning and monitoring for cost effective service deliveryâStaffing and funding arrangements: Centrelink.</para><para> Motion of Senator O'Brien to take note of document agreed to.</para><para>Audit report No. 45 of 1999-2000âPerformance auditâCommonwealth foreign exchange risk management practices.

This report, the subject of which was referred to the committee on 23 September 1999, raises some very interesting questions about the provision of housing for Defence personnel around the country. When we took evidence on this matter in Darwin on 28 October, witnesses from the Defence Housing Authority told us that this was a very urgent project. Indeed, earlier on the committee had received a request for it not to be even considered by the committee. The project, worth $17 million, was for the purchase of 50 house and land packages in Parap Grove, Darwin, which were being developed by a private developer. As I said, we were told that this was an urgent project. It was urgent because of the need to meet the Defence housing requirements for its personnel in Darwin, with particular focus on the 1999-2000 personnel movement arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>In February, I think it was, we were advised that the developer, Bayview Homes, had gone into liquidation and that the Defence Housing Authority had put their pursuit of the 50 house and land packages on hold to see what the outcome of the liquidation might be. We were told that they had options with regard to it and that they would come back to us. We subsequently received a very short letter to say that they were now not going to proceed with the purchase of the 50 house and land packages from the Bayview development. There was no other explanation. We have to consider this against the background that the Public Works Committee was told that this was a very urgent project and that it was vital to meet the Defence housing requirement in respect of the 1999-2000 personnel movement. It is quite possible that the committee would have approved this project. But when the committee was subsequently told that they were not going to proceed, it said, `Look, that simply isn't good enough. We want further explanation.' We did receive some explanation. The brief explanation said that the 50 house and land packages were no longer needed to meet the Defence housing requirements and that they were too expensive. Two or three other things were listed as justification for the Defence Housing Authority no longer wanting to proceed with this project. </para><para>At the same time, the committee was asked to consider another project, Carey Street, which related to a three-tower high-rise development of apartments. The relevance of this particular issue and the process that has been employed over a period of time for the provision of housing for Defence personnel have become very interesting. As a result of some investigation through the estimates and discussions I have had privately with the Defence Housing Authority and people in Defence, I have now ascertained that there is a major problem with the process involving the provision of housing for Defence. It is very interesting to noteâit is something that you do not find in any reports and it is something that has not been forthcoming in any evidence to any estimates committeesâthat Defence pay at least $20 million a year in dead rent. If you look at Defence housing costs to the Department of Defence for the year 1998-99, the net cost of rent alone was $188 million or thereabouts. If you then make an assessment of that, $20 million plus is dead rent. That is rent that is paid for houses that have no tenants. The Darwin region has been a major contributor to that. It is something that I find totally unacceptable. Upon further investigation, I have been able to ascertain that there have been problems with mismatching housing and problems associated with the general management, it would appear, insofar as actually getting people into Defence housing and not having them in the private rental system at the same time.</para><para>What is interesting about this position as it unfoldsâit will become more interesting, and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, that you are also on the Public Works Committee and it is of great interest to youâis that, if we took a snapshot of the Darwin housing situation as at 30 June 1999, it is quite possible that the Department of Defence would have been paying at least $2 million a month in dead rent. That is extraordinary. Of course, there are a number of issues that relate to the provision of information, which I think was one of the problems associated with the Parap Grove development. The Defence Housing Authority ultimately became aware that they did not need the 50 house and land packages and that they were headed towards a massive oversupply problem. This is something that will require both the focus and the attention of the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority to ensure that these sorts of costsâthe costs that, as I said, are at least $20 million a year in dead rentâare avoided.</para><para>I know that the Public Works Committee have been very concerned about this, as is witnessed in this report in which we have referred this particular matter to the Australian National Audit Office for further investigation. And so we should. With regard to the Parap Grove development, I was provided with a letter that was written in August 1999âthat is, before this matter was referred by the parliament to the Public Works Committee. That was a letter between the Defence Housing Authority and the developers of the Parap Grove housing development. That letter would infer quite clearly to me that there was an agreement between the Defence Housing Authority and the company known as Bayview Homes that the Defence Housing Authority purchase 50 house and land packages. That of itself is a very worrying matter. </para><para>The Public Works Committee of this parliament is charged with the responsibility of making an assessment of, firstly, the need for a particular project or development and, secondly, whether or not it represents good value for money. We have to be certain in the future that we make very clear judgments on that. It is incumbent upon the Department of Defence in particular to provide accurate information. If we are to avoid the future waste of money to the tune of $20 million a year at least, then this must occur. I commend this report because, as I said, it has taken a very positive step in recommending to the Australian National Audit Office that there be further investigation of this issue. I hope at the end of the day that we will see better administrative practices as they relate to these matters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title><page.no>15022</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>15022</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Forshaw</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>15022</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are some very important and significant issues with regard to this report on the importation of salmon products. It was very pleasing that it was a unanimous report and it just shows the concern that exists across the board. I do sincerely hope that the government will ultimately take notice of the report, especially some of the recommendations the committee has madeâin particular, the aspects that relate to the WTO rules, the consistency of those rules and the setting of standards for quarantine measures around the globe.</para></talk.start><para>Inconsistencies have been highlighted by other speakers. One of the principal arguments used against us in the WTO disputes process was that our approach to fish products was inconsistent. That is all very well and good, but at the end of the day you ought to have a consistent approach across a range of products. In my view, it is unacceptable for us, as a country that has such great value and importance in agricultural exports, to accept an inconsistent approach to diseases in other products, whether they be animal products or fish products. We ought to be at the forefront, arguing the case that these things ought to be consistent. It does not matter what the disease is. If the disease is contagious and can cause a problem with an animal or in a fish, it ought to be treated the same. We ought to have consistency in the global rules of trade to ensure that everything is treated the same. You should not expect one sector of industry which is involved with one particular product to accept what can only be seen as a lower standard than is applicable to another type of industry. That is unacceptable. That is why the recommendations with respect to international law are so important. That is why we need to make sure that our legal people are in the frontline, looking at arguments that we can present to international forums such as the WTO, to make sure that we not only protect our interests but also promote arguments on the basis of allowing our exports into various other countries.</para><para>I will touch briefly on the science of this issue. Back in 1994 and 1995, when 24 diseases were being investigated, it was put to us by AQIS that these diseases were salmonoid specific. That was one of the reasons why we were pulled up over inconsistency in treatment of other fin fish, whether they were ornamental or coming in as bait. The science progressed very quickly and continues to do so. It now identifies that many of these diseases are now applicable to other fish, that is, other fish can become carriers and are affected by that. Science is a funny thing. It is a bit like law. You can get 10 different opinions on the one issue. What I think has happened in regard to the scientific approach that AQIS has adopted during the process of its risk analyses has been that they have looked at a particular part of the scientific data that is available. If you did an investigation, you would find that a lot of the scientific data has been generated by the salmon industry in other parts of the world. Quite often you could say that that scientific information or scientific data has been prepared on the basis of protecting that industry. That is quite often the case. I find that unacceptable. When we look at diseases and consideration of them, we ought to take account of all the arguments and not just some. There is plenty of evidence that would be contrary to some of the scientific data that was used during the salmon case. </para><para>I want to go now to the consultative process that was employed throughout the case of the salmon imports. We know that it was clearly insufficient. We have had various reportsâone by the committee in 1996 and the Nairn report, which also made recommendations with regard to consultationâbut they have not worked. This committee has made further recommendations in the report to set up a risk assessment committee so that you bring in the various interests that can be affected either by an import application or an export application, whatever the case may be. You can bring those people in from day one so that they can be involved in the process, as they should be. That is fundamentally important. It is not good enough for a government authority to take a view that it can stand alone and just inform the people who could ultimately be affected by the outcomes, as is the case with the salmon inquiry. I hope the government will pick up this recommendation and will ensure that the risk assessment committee process is put in place as part of the consultative arrangements and the risk analysis process. It is very important. </para><para>Finally, I mention a recommendation by the committee which was also recommended by Professor Nairn; that is, the establishment of a key centre for risk analysis. If ever there was something that was important to a country so dependent upon agricultural exports, this is it. You would want to be out there making sure you understand the sciences and that you are arguing the case. I remember AQIS saying to us during this inquiry, `We were the ones up there at the forefront writing the SPS Agreement rules.' It is a funny situation to get yourself in, if you were designing the rules and you are the one who is getting knocked off by them. If we were designing the rules, then we need to back that up. We need to be at the forefront of argument and development of scientific technique and scientific information in regard to disease and export and import risk analysis. That is why such a key centre is so important. We are so dependent on agricultural exports alone. We also have import processes which we must comply with if we are to operate in a global trade and what is often referred to as free trade but also should be referred to as fair trade. If we are going to make the system fair, then we have to put in the resources to ensure that we can argue a case. </para><para>If the rules are there, we should endeavour to use the rules. It is not good enough for some of these other larger countries to exploit the circumstances. We, as a country that really does not have the political muscle, should endeavour to apply the rules and at least be arguing the application of those rules. We will be better prepared to do that if we have things like a key centre for risk analysis which can generate the training, expertise and knowledge to be able to present arguments in the interests of this country. Again I would urge the government to take on board those recommendations and make the changes which can only be to the betterment and in the best interests of this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15023</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI, too, want to address the motion to take note of the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">An appropriate level of protection?</inline> During Senator Murphy's contribution, I was looking at an article which is available through the Parliamentary Library entitled `A real world where people live and work and die'. It is an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of World Trade</inline> published in 1998. It opens with this passage:</para></talk.start><quote><para>âIt is essential to bear in mind that the risk that is to be evaluated ... is not only risk ascertainable in a science laboratory operating under strictly controlled conditions, but also risk in human societies as they actually exist, in other words, the actual potential for adverse effects on human health <inline font-style="italic">in the real world where people live and work and die.</inline>â</para></quote><para>That is a quote from which the title of the article was taken.</para><para>This report is about the circumstances which underpin Australia's current quarantine regime for the importation of salmon and other salmonid products, and indeed other products. At the time this article was published last year there was a debate about Australia's right to maintain its ban on the importation of Canadian salmon. It is interesting to note that at that time this scholarly article published in a journal, properly attributed in terms of footnoting of the sources of the material, said this: </para><quote><para>The SPS Agreement offers both opportunities and threats for many countries. It provides opportunities for exporting countries to challenge quarantine restrictions in many markets, at the same time exposing their own restrictions to challenge by foreign exporters. What predictions then, can be made on the outcome of the <inline font-style="italic">Canadian Salmon</inline> case? Australia has argued that given the total freedom of salmon disease in Australian waters, Australian tuna populations enjoy minimal disease tolerance. Any translocation of disease would have a devastating effect, wiping out both fish stocks and the Australian tuna industry.</para></quote><para>I think they mean salmon. To continue:</para><quote><para>In such circumstances, the appropriate level of protection might be <inline font-style="italic">zero tolerance</inline>. Two arguments have been maintained by Canada. First, scientific evidence supporting a ban is inadequate and contradictory. Second, Article 6 of the SPS Agreement obliges Australia to recognise disease-free areas within Canada. Where such areas can be objectively demonstrated, a blanket restriction on <inline font-style="italic">Canadian</inline> salmon may not be sustainable.</para><para>At the end of the day, what is required is a balance of competing interests: the importing county's appropriate level of protectionâ</para></quote><para>and I emphasise those wordsâ</para><quote><para>and potential gains from the liberalisation of trade. Where the potential detriment to Australia is severe (the total destruction of salmon stocks and the loss of an industry), compared to any possible gains from trade liberalisation to Canadian producers and Australian consumers, a total import ban may be argued as both necessary and justified. This might be notwithstanding an obligation to recognise area freedoms. It is also a legitimate argument that existing testing and sampling methods and technology may not provide for a confidence level consistent with the importing country's protection needs.</para></quote><para>Again, I interpose here `the appropriate level of protection'. It continues:</para><quote><para>In such cases, a total import ban may be the <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> effective means of achieving an adequate level of protection.</para></quote><para>Adequate? `Appropriate' is used in the title of the report. It touches on one of the problems that the committee discovered in investigating just how we arrived at the conclusion that was reached in this matter. It was very clear from the evidence that the route for arriving at what was described as Australia's appropriate level of protection was circuitous. It certainly was not clearly defined at all. The answers to the questions we asked of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated that there was no certainty at all that this matter had actually been considered by government. Rather, the likelihood was that AQIS had determined Australia's appropriate level of protection. I am not saying that they did that without authority or approval. What I am saying is that that is how it happened. The committee, in reviewing that evidence and the evidence of AQIS, was in my view the subject of some suggestionsâwhich do not appear on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, because no-one was prepared to put them on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>âthat addressing the issue of how Australia arrived at its appropriate level of protection would somehow be counterproductive. The committee did not subscribe to that view, and to its credit its report reflects what appears in the evidence in terms of the importance of having a very clearly defined appropriate level of protectionâthat is, a determination by this country, as is its sovereign right under the SPS Agreement, of just what our appropriate level of protection is.</para><para>The committee has recommended that that be done not just by the Commonwealth but in consultation with the states. What is clear from this eventuality is that in regard to salmon we have a breakdown between the Commonwealth's view as to quarantine arrangements and Tasmania's view as to quarantine arrangements. Perhaps the matter will not stop there if there is not some sort of understanding reached between the Commonwealth and the statesâand perhaps a binding understanding at thatâthat, whatever our determination as to what is appropriate regarding the level of sovereign risk this country will bear, that is held around the federation. </para><para>Another alarming thing was drawn to our attention in the evidence presented before the committee. Though there was a memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the states on the question of quarantine arrangements, the impression that an officer of the Attorney-General's Department gave the committee was that that memorandum was not enforceable at law by the states. If that is true, it is not enforceable at law by the Commonwealth. There has been some suggestion in relation to the Tasmanian situation that somehow the matter will be resolved by taking it to the High Court. If that officer's evidence is to be accepted, then no such recommendation will go to the Commonwealth government because the Attorney-General's office is of the view that the right of the Commonwealth in relation to any agreement between the states is not enforceable at law. That raises the question as to why we find ourselves in that situation. But perhaps that is another question.  </para><para>The committee was at pains to ensure that we learn from the experience of this case, particularly that we learn from the inadequacies which the committee identified in Australia's method of protecting its rights in the WTO. The committee has laid down some recommendations which relate to the establishment of an office of international law which is independent in the sense of not being able to be suborned to the view of other departments, so that fearless and independent advice can be presented in all of Australia's international dealings and so that the appropriate international legal protections are present in those negotiations in the future. </para><para>I see that my time is running out. It is pleasing to see the degree of support and approval that the committee's report has received in the public domain. Having gone through the process of taking the parliament to the people, as this committee has done, and having done its job properly, it is pleasing to see that the people of Australia who appreciate the subject appreciate the work of this committee.

The Australian people are again looking to Labor for the next generation of public policy ideas and reforms.</para></quote><para>I would suggest that this claim looks very sick. A party that hopes to secure office only by scablifting and by scaremongering does not deserve to govern. Tonight I want to touch on just one of the many reasons for the Labor Party's injured capacity to produce policies of relevance to the people of modern Australia. I speak about the continuing control of the Australian Labor Party by the union movement.  </para><para>Unions, with their ethos of collective action and mass agitation, are in many ways relics of another era, one where big unions confronted big business under the watchful gaze of big government. In the new economy of the 21st century, unions are far less important. Under the influence of technological advancement and the information revolution, the nature of work is changing very quickly. As both employers and employees demand greater flexibility in ordering their affairs, as employment becomes less and less trade based, and as jobs for life are replaced by frequent jobâeven careerâchanges, the scope for legitimate union influence narrows dramatically. Yet, blind to all the new realities, the Labor Party continues to be the slave of the union movement. </para><para>At no time in our political history have so few had so much influence over so many. Unions still control 60 per cent of voting delegates at each national conference of the ALP. Yet they represent less than 25 per cent of the Australian work force. In fact, 80 per cent of private sector and 75 per cent of public sector employees do not belong to a trade union. In small businesses which employ fewer than 10 peopleâthe vast majority of businessesâ90 per cent of employees choose not to join their employee organisations. In August last year, the total union membership in Australia was 1.87 million and has been falling by an average of 90,000 members per year for quite some time now. The NRMA has got as many members as all trade unions; sporting clubs have twice as many members as all trade unions; private health insurance funds have three times as many members as all trade unions. Clearly, these statistics give lie to claims by the ACTU head, Sharan Burrow, that the unions are the largest representative group in Australia. Clearly, they are not. </para><para>Failing to be relevant to the needs of Australian workers, the unions have chiefly become a career vehicle for ambitious men and women with political aspirations. You might call it a `kindergarten' for future Labor parliamentarians. Currently, six out of the 10 ALP shadow cabinet ministers are former union officials, including two former ACTU presidentsâSimon Crean and Martin Fergusonâwith a third one, Jenny George, still attempting to join them. In fact, the union presence and influence are growing in the ALP ranks. In 1983, only 28 per cent of Labor members of the House of Representatives and, indeed, only 30 per cent of Labor senators were former union officials. Now, even though union membership has plummeted by half since those glory days, union representation in the parliamentary Labor Party has nearly doubledâover half of the whole Labor parliamentary party are former union activists or union lawyers. In this chamber, 20 out of 29 Labor senators are in that category. Compared to the composition of a wider Australian work force, trade union officials are overrepresented 1,500 times in the parliamentary Labor Party. </para><para>It now seems that the unions have decided to abolish all individual employment contracts should the Labor Party return to government. The right wing and the left wing unions have banded together in the cause of denying Australian workers freedom of choice. Kim Beazley has already announced that he would abolish Australian workplace agreements and, of course, the Office of the Employment Advocate. There are now 100,000 formal AWAs federally and the total number is growing at more than 3,000 every month. As the ALP yet again attempts to restrict people's freedom of choiceâfreedom has never been a catch-cry of the Left, ever, and Senator Schacht knows thatâit becomes apparent that it is entering the 21st century with 19th century policies on industrial relations.

One of the most successful Labor politicians, the newly re-elected Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley, has recently called for such an outcome.

The sad part is that, continually, the Labor Party is shackled by the trade union movement. If it listened to Councillor Soorley, it would move on, undo the shackles and perhaps, like Mr Blair in Britain, move forward. The only way the Australian Labor Party will have the capacity to move forward and become relevant and not have its capacity compromised, prejudiced and endangered is if it does that. The question will be whether it has the courage to do that. But I doubt whether people like Senator Schacht, remnants of the Vietnam generation still clinging to power, will finally come to understand that. In the meantime, the debate will go on. I suspect that one day, perhaps in my life in this parliament, the ALP will formally cut those ties.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title><page.no>15028</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15028</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on a matter that has nothing to do with what Senator Mason spoke about in that prepared statement from Mr Reith. I want to raise today matters concerning the present reorganisation of the ABC with its new managing director, Mr Shier. Two or three weeks ago at a Senate estimates hearing, Mr Shier appeared and spoke stronglyâand I supported what he saidâin asking that the ABC be given access to multi-broadcasting in the new digital arrangements. The Labor Party support that, and the Democrats support it. We hope the government sees sense and amends its own bill to meet that opportunity to expand the broadcasting capability of the ABC. However, in only the last day or so, information has come to me that some of the other proposals that Mr Shier is preparing with respect to the ABC are matters which, if correct, are of great concern not only to the staff of the ABC but particularly to the millions of listeners and viewers of the ABC and to the Australian community. We all recognise the absolute importance of the role that the ABC, as a national institution, performs in Australia. </para></talk.start><para>I have been informed from various sources that there is to be a major restructuring of the current affairs operations of the ABC. I have been told that there is a proposal afoot to abolish the ABC programs that we have all grown up with or have been living with for the last couple of decades or moreâa proposal to abolish <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The World Today </inline>under the guise that there will be more regionalism in Australia and that local ABC radio stations around Australia will have a choice of whether they want to run their own current affairs program or other sorts of programs or take <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline>. I find that a very disturbing outcome. The programs I have just mentioned have now become a major feature for the Australian public to get up-to-date, in-depth current affairs coverage on a daily basis of major issues confronting Australia and confronting the world.</para><para>At times, all governmentsâincluding my own government, when we were in governmentâhave not liked some of the reporting and some of the interviews and issues given an airing on those programs. By the very nature of the programs, if you are in government you are going to be under more examination than if you are in opposition. That is just the function of current affairs, and so it should be. Even if you happen to be a minister, not liking what is being said or the criticism being aired about you or your policies is a function of democracy. The suggestion that those programs can be abolished, wiped out and replaced by some lower level of so-called regional current affairs or regional interview programs is of great concern, if it is correct. I am told that not only are those programs to be replaced but that the current affairs branch of the ABC will instead be asked to provide up to seven minutes of a shortened amount of current affairs each hour that may be played at the end of each hourly news service on the ABCâbut, again, it would not be automatically played: overwhelmingly, the decision is left at a regional level. </para><para>I come from a small state and I am very strongly in support of regional and state coverage of issues. That is very important. But I think that the balance in the ABC is about right at the moment. We get plenty of coverage on regional radio, Adelaide metropolitan radio and Radio National but we also want, as Australians, to have a national and an international focus. No other media can provide it in the way that the ABC does, particularly with its television and radio current affairs. The idea that a national current affairs program like the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> could be abolished as a national program, so that there is no national current affairs, will diminish Australia and our vision as a nation with a national and an international view of issues. I am alarmed to hear this. Most of us have not responded to some of the stories that have been appearing about management changes and people being asked to leave the ABC. We have not overreacted to that. We have observed that happening. But if it is true that programs like <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline> are to be abolished and replaced by snippets of current affairs every hour, that is very concerning.</para><para>I know that, from time to time, governments of all persuasions have criticised these programsâbecause no-one likes criticism. I also have to note that in particular in recent years the Prime Minister, Senator Alston and others have been very critical of the ABC. I have heard that they do not like the in-depth coverage that is given. Sometimes those programs give coverage to issues that are very uncomfortable for people like the Prime Minister: issues of reconciliation and Aboriginal indigenous affairs, and issues of other minority groups. But if they do not get an airing on the ABC as part of the public debate, they will not get an airing anywhere else. The ABC is fulfilling its charter role in ensuring that a range of views and a range of issues, no matter how uncomfortable, are given a chance to be debated and put forward, and that is a very good democratic outcome.</para><para>It would be a tragedy if current affairs in the ABC is gutted in the way I hear it is proposed to be gutted and replaced with a mediocre level of current affairs, if it still exists, and replaced by trying to ape commercial radio with pleasant interviews with sporting personalities, actors and other people in the community about pleasant things that we enjoy in Australia. We have to get the balance right. The ABC has had the balance about right, never perfect. The threat to these programs, if correct, is a very serious one. I therefore conclude with a challenge to Mr Shier, the new general manager, and to Mr McDonald, the Chairman of the ABC. As this would be a fundamental change in current affairs at the ABC, would they come forth immediately and explain to us whether this is a possibility or say, `No, those changes are not going to be effected,' that there is no truth to the suggestions I have heard and that they are not on the agenda of the new manager and the board that the government has now appointed in its own image. If that is the case, I will say that that is very good and that I am glad to have cleared the air.</para><para>But if they cannot categorically say that these major changes to current affairs will not take place, I think there will be, quite rightly, a major, rip-roaring debate in the Australian community, not just within the ABC but in the broader community of listeners and viewers of the ABC, and even in the broader media community and those who may not be ABC devotees like some of us. This is a very worrying matter that has been raised, and I raise it in this adjournment debate to try to get the ABC to clarify immediately that this is not the case. I certainly hope it is not the case. If it is, the debate will really be joined in this country because we will not let this government, the people they have appointed to the board and the new general manager gut the ABC's independence and destroy it as a national institution that is so important to the fabric of our country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Business Information</title><page.no>15030</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>15030</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to share an extraordinary tale, which I referred to in question time today. On 1 June I received a letter which is astonishing. It is a list of the failure of the government and the Australian Taxation Office to deliver on simple, explicit requests from informed constituents of mine for information. It is a letter from my constituents, Tom and Marie Potts, who operate the Cowley Beach Caravan Park near Mourilyan at Innisfail.</para></talk.start><para>I will go to the substance of the letter. They basically provide a chronology of their correspondence and their phone calls to the Australian Tax Office for information in order to make themselves GST compliant by 1 July. On 23 February this year they ordered the accommodation industry booklet. They ordered the cafes, restaurants and catering industry information and the retailing and wholesaling new tax system information. On that date they also ordered the cafÃ© and restaurant industry CD. On 2 May they ordered the E-Record CD and were told it would take 10 working days to arrive. On 15 May they ordered videos and were told they would be sent straight away. Also on that date they ordered the GST and business skills kit, which includes a CD, a booklet on five steps to get your business GST ready, GST and business skills, summary guide for business and a checklist. On the 19th of that month, they rang regarding their E-Record CD and were told that it would take another five working days. They were also told that there had been a mistake on it and that it would have to be re-issued. On 29 May they re-ordered the pack of four videos. They also ordered the CD on how to keep business records and the video on how to keep business records. On 29 May they were given a number for a direct line for the E-Record information they were looking for. On phoning that number, they heard a recorded message and they left their name and phone number. On 29 May they were also given a number for the distribution centre. Mrs Potts spoke to a woman who apparently did not know a thing about the order numbers from 23 February. Apparently her computer had been down and she had to ring Mrs Potts back. When she did ring back, Mrs Potts was told that the order was sent on Saturday 27 May. Unfortunately, Mrs Potts is still waiting for that document, and so the story continues. On 1 June Mrs Potts rang the distribution centre again and was told that the E-Record CD was now in quarantine and would not be available for two weeks. Mrs Potts advises that, out of all of those requests, the only thing they have received is the booklet called `Retailing and wholesaling the new tax'âfive months after the beginning of their attempt to become GST ready.</para><para>Following receipt of their letter, I contacted the Cairns signpost officer, who visited the caravan park and Mr and Mrs Potts yesterday. I understand that the officer was `very nice', according to Mrs Potts. He had an array of products but not the CDs or the videos they require in order to make their business GST compliant. Mrs Potts told me that eventually she just said, `Just give me anything you've got.' I make no reflection on the officer himself. He responded absolutely promptly to my call, and I have to say that he drove for about 1Â½ hours down to the caravan park to visit my constituents. He did say to me that he himself was having difficulty obtaining GST compliance products. I ask: if he is having difficulty, what chance do small businesspeople in remote locations have? I must say that Mr and Mrs Potts are very good businesspeople. They embraced the change that is coming to them and got moving. They have an ABN number; they got that very early. But they have no information about where to go next. In Marie Potts's own words, `This is just what I didn't want to happen.' Now they will be rushed and, unfortunately, that is when mistakes are often made.</para><para>This story exemplifies so well the lack of trust in the government's GST and in its implementation that so many business people are expressing to me and, I am sure, to many of my colleagues in this chamber. For example, I have heard: `I've been to three seminars, and I'm still no clearer. You would think that Mr Howard would have thought more about how to bring in his beloved tax.' Another one: `I ring the 13 numbers and get different answers every time.' It is no wonder that there is no faith or trust in the implementation process of the GST when these business people, very tired, sit down and watch their televisions in the evening and see the GST chain ads. They know that they are paying for the pleasure of receiving that politically inspired messageâat a total cost of $420 million and still rising. </para><para>Today we have seen the spectacle of a government having to pulp eight million letters to the electors of Australia after repeatedly being advised by Labor that the use of the AEC database was unlawful. What chance do the Australian people have to deal with this new tax when they try repeatedly to get relevant GST implementation products and cannot be satisfied? What chance do the Australian people have to accommodate this level of change, when the politicisation of the implementation has been at such a high level? I suggest that this government is lurching from disaster to disaster in the implementation of the GST.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cox Peninsula Transmitter: Sale</title><page.no>15031</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>15031</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I will add some remarks to the debate about Radio Australia and the recent announcement that the Cox Peninsula would be leased to a British based religious broadcasting company, Christian Vision. The Senate this afternoon debated this matter in general business and, unfortunately, time expired before I was able to enter the debate. During the debate this afternoon, the issue was canvassed very thoroughly by opposition senators and by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats. This is an issue that many of us will recall came to a head back in 1997-98 when the then minister, Senator Alston, announced that funding to the ABC would be cut and, further, that a review would be undertaken into the operations of the ABC. It is a good lesson for all of us, and certainly I would urge Senator Alston to take the time to revisit some of the election policy announcements that he made prior to the 1996 election and to revisit what he placed on the Internet. Senator Alston makes much in this chamber of his supposed expertise and knowledge in this area, and he is the minister, so it would behove him to look at some of the things that he and the government have said in the past with respect to the ABC and Radio Australia. </para></talk.start><para>I first of all draw attention to a report of the Senate Select Committee on ABC management and operations. The report, <inline font-style="italic">Our ABC</inline>, was published in March 1995. The select committee was established by the Senate and chaired by Senator Alston. In that report, he was at pains to hop into the then management of the ABCâin particular, the then chairman, Mr David Hillâand was very critical of the ABC for, amongst other things, not giving sufficient support to key areas of the ABC's responsibilities under its charter. He was concerned that the ABC was chasing sponsorship dollars through infotainment programs and that, rather, it should be directing its energies at core activities such as Radio Australia. For instance, with respect to the view of the committee that he chaired, in the majority report he stated:</para><quote><para>The Committee supports the maintenance of ABC funding at least at its current level, the continuation of the triennial funding arrangements and the continued application of the Non-Farm GDP deflator.</para></quote><para>The committee was chaired by Senator Alston, who was no doubt very heavily involved in the preparation of the final majority report. I think the following quote from the report is most important in view of what has happened since:</para><quote><para>The Committee therefore recommends that where the Parliament requires the ABC to undertake new Charter activities or to expand existing Charter activities, it should provide funds sufficient to ensure that existing activities are not adversely affected.</para></quote><para>Those are very strong commitments and very strong words with regard to the need to ensure adequate continued funding into the future for the ABC, and particularly to ensure that it be given sufficient funds so that it could enter into new ventures, new activities, that would be required because of the new technology that was coming in and is so much now a part of our way of life.</para><para>In respect of one other area that is relevant to this current debate about Radio Australia and the leasing of the Cox Peninsula, whilst that committee did not specifically look at Radio Australia, it did look at the operations of Australia Television, which was a new venture set up by the ABC to broadcast television into Asiaâclearly, a similar activity to that which has been performed for many years within the ABC by Radio Australia. The committee report said: </para><quote><para>When the ABC Board reviews the ATV service in June 1996 it should make an assessment of the level of government funding required to make up the difference between sponsorship revenue and the amount required to operate the service. The Government should then give serious consideration to including any such shortfall in the ABC budget appropriation.</para></quote><para>They were very strong words from Senator Alston's committee at the time, strongly supporting funding for the maintenance and expansion, no doubt, of ATV. With respect particularly to Radio Australia, I will read what the policy of the Liberal-National coalition was prior to the 1996 general election. This was published on the Liberal Party web site. What is interesting is that this was still on the web site in March 1997â12 months after they got into office. This is what their policy was:</para><quote><para>Radio Australia has a proud place in the ABC. It has been providing overseas services for half a century benefiting not only Australian expatriates but also the nationals of many countries, particularly those in our region. The coalition is strongly supportive of Radio Australia's existing services and will ensure that they are not prejudiced or downgraded in any way.</para></quote><para>They were the words of the coalition's policy at the time, and even 12 months after they were elected. When I drew this to the attention of Senator Alston on 24 March 1997, because he had already started to cut into the funding of the ABC, he quickly had that removed from the web site. That policy was no longer relevant. But, of course, we also recall the famous interview between Jim Middleton from the ABC and Senator Alston on the night of their victory in the 1996 election. Jim Middleton asked Senator Alston, who was in the tally-room, I believe, with the ABC team at the time:</para><quote><para>First of all the commitment close to home about the ABC and commitment to maintain funding in real terms of the coming parliament, does that stand?</para></quote><para>Senator Alston replied:</para><quote><para>Absolutely.</para></quote><para>Of course, the history since then is on the record. Senator Schacht and other speakers dealt with it this afternoon. Progressively, since the moment the government was elected and Senator Alston became the responsible minister for the ABC, he has proceeded to gut it at every opportunity. First of all, there was his proposal that went forward to the expenditure committee preparing the 1996-97 budget. We all recall the leaked document. It had two proposals. One was for huge cuts to the ABCâin excess, I believe, of $150 million to $200 million. The ABC was going to lose Triple J, Radio Australia and ATVâjust about every other popular program you could think of was in danger. But the softer optionâit was not all that soft but softer than that oneâwas eventually adopted: to take $55 million out of the ABC's funding and then to establish the Mansfield inquiry. Of course, we all know what happened with the Mansfield report: Radio Australia was gutted. We now see the results of that. There is now a desperate need for us to increase the activities of Radio Australia.
