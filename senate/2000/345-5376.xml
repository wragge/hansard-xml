He understands as well as all Australians, the Labor Party included, that it is very much in the interests of Australia as well as the interests of Telstra and its shareholders that we progress the sale as quickly as possible. That is a policy approach that is blindingly obvious to anyone who ever came here, to anyone who ever lived here, to anyone who ever experienced the very poor quality of service you got when the Labor Party ran Telstra, when the Labor Party never used the power of direction, when the Labor Party's policy on services was, `Well, give them a call. Ask them to come out and fix the phone. If they are too busy, I am sorry, we can't help you.' That was their approach.</para></talk.start><para>Let there be no doubt about this. We have always made it clear that we believe this is a policy in the best interests of everyone concerned—except perhaps the unions; I would have to concede that. We took that policy to the 1996 election. We took it to the 1998 election and we will take it to the next election. That will be one of the very big battle lines for the next federal election. Given that it will be one of the big battle lines drawn for the next election, tomorrow night represents a very big opportunity for the leader of the federal opposition, because my understanding is that he is going to deliver himself of a speech that will explain why Telstra should not be sold. I presume the title of the oration is `Not till we get to government'.</para><para>But what the punters will really be looking for from Mr Beazley will be not windy rhetoric or prolix prose. They just want a few home truths. They want to know why, for example, when Mr Beazley was in government he sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas without telling the public beforehand. In other words, he said one thing and did another, as of course he is doing now. He also should explain why he expects the public to believe him on that. It is also a very big opportunity for him to finally admit that he invited Frank Blount to come to this country so Telstra could be privatised and, at the same time, explain why he expects the public to believe him when he now denies that.</para><para>It is also a very big opportunity for Mr Beazley to explain why he was there with Paul Keating in September 1995 when they offered to sell Telstra to BHP, because all he has said so far is, `It's irrelevant whether I was there or not.' I think we all know there is a bit more to it than that. It is highly relevant. We know why he was there. It was because he was wanting to flog it to try and fix up the $10 billion budget black hole, which you on the other side all knew about but lied your heads off and said you did not. That was another classic example of Mr Beazley saying one thing and doing another. He ought to be able to explain tomorrow night why it is the Labor Party's policy to sell off Yellow Pages and MobileNet, why they only talk about core assets but are happy to divest themselves of the rest, why as Deputy Prime Minister he was happy to see Telstra sell off its networking business, IBMGSA, but now they are no longer prepared to condone that because they say it is privatisation by stealth. </para><para>There are a lot of very big issues that Mr Beazley can address tomorrow night. I think the public really wants to understand the truth, not just the smokescreen that is going to be put up between now and the next election.

You do not have to take my word for it. You can ask Carl Scully and Jim Bacon, because they have been out there saying, `Thank you very much. We like the proceeds of the sale of Telstra being applied to state infrastructure projects.' In fact, Carl Scully says, `We want a lot more of where that came from.' They are dead keen to get their hands on it—and so is the National Party and so is everyone else in rural Australia—because they recognise that the funds simply are not there otherwise. So this is another big opportunity for Mr Beazley to explain why he blocked $250 million for Networking the Nation, why he was opposed to a $670 million social bonus out of T2, why, as finance minister, he privatised everything that moved and why indeed he said, in the classic weasel words, `We won't support privatisation until there is adequate competition.' Now we have something like 40 carriers. There is going to be a lot in this speech and I look forward to being there. I will be asking the first question.

The government has a very proud record of what it is doing in the aged care industry, considering what we were left with after 13 years of neglect. We inherited a destabilised aged care industry in this country. The senator knows very well that more than 14,000 places were made available for the allocation in the year 2000 approvals rounds, double the 7,000 places allocated in the 1999 round. So it is an absolute fallacy to say that we have neglected the industry. We are righting the wrongs that we inherited when the Labor Party went out of power. Thank God they went out of power. I can speak on behalf of the aged care industry itself. They left the industry in a total shambles. By their own report, there was an enormous deficit.

Just because I do not respond in the manner which the opposition wants, it is not a reflection on the answer that I am about to give. The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency has advised the minister that it will complete the accreditation of all aged care facilities by the legislative date of 1 January 2000. All aged care facilities were required to submit the initial application for accreditation, known as form A, by 31 December last year. All facilities have completed this part of the process. In addition, all facilities were required to complete the second stage—the self-assessment form—by 31 March 2000 to accommodate the facilities' preferences for a date of site audit. Ninety-eight per cent of all facilities have completed this process. Less than 60 are still to submit this stage of their applications. This high response illustrates the industry's acceptance of the accreditation system. Might I ask, Madam Deputy President—adopting the Melham response—what the Labor Party are going to do about the accreditation system? They are going to accept it. They are not going to change it. Just like the GST, they are not going to change it. They are not going to change our health care rebate. They are going to sit down, as my colleague Senator Vanstone said, and listen to people. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

We still have not heard their policy. So there is a rapidly ageing population; more people are being admitted to hospitals. One of the great things we are doing is allowing people to determine their own access to hospitals. It is a reality that there is a relatively small number in the population who are in nursing homes.

In one way I wish this was your main question because I have a storehouse of information on this that I will not be able to get to you in one minute. You are right: Western Australia, when you compare the indigenous incarceration rate—that is, so many per hundred thousand—with the non-indigenous, has the highest incarceration rate of any state. What you neglect to mention, of course, is that the Northern Territory has one of the lowest. Tasmania is the lowest; the Northern Territory is next, followed by my state and I think New South Wales and Queensland. My own state and Queensland have a rate that is double that of the Territory. What that should tell you, Senator, is that there is no good in just hanging onto mandatory sentencing and ignoring it in the Territory and in other states, and ignoring it in other offences. It should also tell you that picking on a figure such as incarceration rates does not tell you a lot, either, because the Northern Territory is almost an exemplar in that sense. The impact of the justice system on the indigenous community is a very complex issue, and it is not one that I think has been served very well by this mandatory sentencing debate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care: Residential Care Places</title><page.no>13783</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13783</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Herron representing the Minister for Aged Care.

If you had been following the debate in relation to diversionary programs which are now used fairly widely around Australia—especially in relation to drugs—you would know that this government has worked very closely with the states to encourage diversionary programs in relation to first-time offenders and drugs. The program generally works like this: when the police believe they have apprehended the appropriate person who has committed an offence, the person is given a choice—`Would you like to go on a diversionary program and hopefully find a better way?' or `Would you like to be charged with the offence?' Those people who do not choose to go into the diversionary program, or who go into it and then drop out, still face the option of charges. That is how a diversionary program works. It is a choice between proceeding into the criminal justice system, and the consequences that follow, or offering what we believe is a better alternative.

This was a very big statement that Senator Conroy made, and I think we should now demand that it be made clear once and for all whether the Labor Party will guarantee the tax cuts that we are bringing in or whether they plan to abolish the tax cuts—as in the famous l-a-w law. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13787</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting—</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

It was an anniversary marked with some sadness due to the recent death of one of the senior traditional owners. He was a man who had a deep commitment to his traditional lands and a vision for the advancement of the indigenous people of the region. But the anniversary gave us the opportunity to reflect on the successes of Kakadu National Park.</para></talk.start><para>The world heritage values of the park continue to be managed and protected under a joint agreement between the Commonwealth and the traditional owners. This is despite the increasingly dishonest claims of groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation. Last week they were at it again, trying to scare everyone about a potential water spill from a retention pond at the Jabiluka mine site. For the record, the independent Supervising Scientist has advised that there is no imminent risk of overflow or release. He also advises that no approvals have been given for discharge of excess run-off waters and that none will occur this wet season. His advice also repudiates claims that the pond was constructed without the necessary approvals.</para><para>I am able to report to the Senate even more progress in the protection of Kakadu. In July last year, the Howard government committed almost $3.2 million to upgrading tourism infrastructure in the park. Planning or construction is already under way on key projects such as the Yellow Water boardwalk, the Jim Jim Falls road, the Jim Jim Falls camp ground and new boardwalks. These projects are important in presenting the national values of the park in a way that also protects them from damage. They will help attract more tourists to the region, providing jobs and other economic benefits to the local population. We are also well advanced in implementing our response to the Kakadu Regional Social Impact Study, under the leadership of former Labor Senator Bob Collins. This includes: new housing, construction and major upgrades worth $1.2 million, which are under way in a number of Kakadu out-stations; $3 million worth of construction, due to begin on improvements to basic infrastructure such as power, sewerage and water reticulation; and better employment opportunities through community development employment projects and through Parks Australia, which has increased its numbers of indigenous trainee park rangers.  </para><para>We have launched a groundbreaking hospitality training course for indigenous people, based in the Crocodile Hotel. Already 22 young Aboriginal people are in training, and there are more to follow. We are giving them the skills to help them take advantage of the growing tourism and hospitality industry in the Northern Territory—real training for real jobs. We are negotiating with the Northern Territory government to co-fund a new Aboriginal education unit at the Jabiru Area School to provide increased levels of education to young Aboriginal people in an environment that respects their cultural background. And we are working on a number of measures to improve the delivery of health services throughout the region. I have sought to demonstrate to the Senate that not only are we proud of proclaiming the first stage of the park but also, in celebrating its 21st anniversary, we are working on practical and sensible ways to work with the local indigenous people to give them jobs for the future, better health, better education and better homes.</para><para>Madam Deputy President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>13790</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mandatory Sentencing</title><page.no>13790</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13790</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—During question time, Senator Greig asked me a question, and I have some information which may be of interest to senators.

I am advised that, through that program, Aboriginal communities are working through the local Safer WA committees and the regional Aboriginal justice councils to try to find solutions to the very high rates of incarceration that there are for Aboriginal people in Western Australia. For example, their rate is 20.7 in the comparator—compared to the Northern Territory. There are plenty of states that have double the Territory's problem.

In fact, there is a bill in the area of migration law that is going to do that, but at least parliament has a say.

In other words, the victims have a bit of a say in this. You have always been for the victim. In this case there is no consideration given to the victim; it is up to the police. They are going to exercise a discretion which is a larger discretion than any other police force in this country has. It is a matter of having things done by the executive rather than having things done by the judiciary. It is another attack by this government, unfortunately, on the judicial system of this country—whether it is in this area, whether it is in the area of migration or anywhere else. This is a further attack, carried out through the general orders of the Northern Territory police, on the judiciary. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13792</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The speech by Senator Cooney shows once again how the Labor Party seem to be more concerned about process than outcomes. Surely, I would have thought, the Labor Party would have celebrated the wonderful outcome that was achieved as a result of negotiation between two heads of government within this country. It was an outcome that I thought, in fact, Senator Cooney and his party were wanting to achieve. But, of course, as is so often the wont with the Australian Labor Party at the moment, they are in a position of policy paralysis and they do not know what they want. </para></talk.start><para>In fact, in Senator Cooney's contribution we were not told what Labor would have done if it had been in power. But just in case the Australian people want to have some indication of what Labor would have done if it were in power and Kim Beazley were to have been Prime Minister, listen to this. On 16 February this year, Mr Beazley said, `I think mandatory sentencing has to go.' It was black and white. Six days later he said, `I agree'—see, he is softening now—`that it is more desirable that it be done at the level of government that actually enforced the laws.' Then, on 31 March, he said, `The criminal law of Western Australia should be determined by West Australians, and there's no question about that.' So within a month we had the double backflip. First of all he was saying mandatory sentencing had to go and then, within the course of a month, he was saying, `Well, really, Western Australia can determine it for itself.' </para><para>On this occasion, in a very sophisticated move, the Prime Minister was able to talk to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and achieve an outcome that I thought virtually everybody in this parliament wanted—that is, a softening of the Territory's approach. Let me simply remind Senator Cooney and honourable senators opposite that if they really do want judicial discretion, let us look at the outcomes in those jurisdictions that do have judicial discretion and no mandatory penalties. What do you find in relation to the incarceration rate of our indigenous population? The Northern Territory, with its mandatory sentencing policy, had the second lowest rate of Aboriginal incarceration per 100,000 of population—lower than any other state or territory bar Tasmania. My home state of Tasmania had an even lower rate than the Northern Territory. So those who would celebrate judicial discretion are in fact celebrating a higher rate of incarceration of our indigenous population. They are the facts and figures, and it is unfortunate that certain friends of ours within the media, and the public commentators, do not grasp the facts and do not grasp the figures but just run with platitudes that sound warm and caring. </para><para>The fact is—and I repeat—the jurisdictions with judicial discretion in this country had a higher rate of indigenous incarceration per 100,000 head of population than the Northern Territory. Once again, it is a classic example of Senator Cooney and the Labor Party saying, `We want judicial discretion no matter what the impact will be on the indigenous community.' That is really what they are saying. Then Senator Cooney and the Labor Party—and I assume he is speaking on behalfof the Labor Party—bemoan the fact that judges will not have a say in relation to the diversionary therapy proposals. Let me simply say to Senator Cooney: we would try to catch the young offender and save him or her from the judicial system altogether. I would have thought that was humane, I would have thought that was responsible and I would have thought that was a good social outcome if you had a genuine social conscience and a genuine social concern rather than a simple concern for cheap headlines, irrespective of the social outcomes. We on this side are very proud of the agreement that the Prime Minister was able to reach with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Other Labor speakers might like to tell us what they would have actually done if they were in government, other than engage in a cheap discourse of political point scoring which, of course, is not aided by the facts because the facts speak against exactly what Senator Cooney was trying to put to us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>13793</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also want to speak on this taking note of the responses to a number of questions during today's question time. Let us, in the first instance, deal with the reaction of the Northern Territory to yesterday's agreement. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory was on television and all of the electronic media last evening claiming a big win—a win-win—because he achieved everything he set out to achieve during the negotiations on this, and pocketed $5 million to boot. That is $5 million a year. But his legislation remains intact, apart from one very significant and, I might say, very welcome amendment to it—that is, that the age of juveniles will move from 17 to 18. That is welcomed by us. But the agreement of yesterday actually brings more concern than it does joy, despite the joy that we feel about the movement in age from 17 to 18.</para></talk.start><para>A major part of those concerns has already been addressed by my colleague Senator Cooney in dealing with the enhanced and increased powers that are given to the police force in the Northern Territory by yesterday's agreement. There is no question at all that the police have been given enhanced and increased responsibility under the agreement of yesterday. I do not know if they will be given any additional resources. The bigger questions that Senator Cooney addressed are: what is the public accountability of those increased powers to the police forces and where is that going to be seen? We have not yet seen the small print of this agreement. Of course, there are things in this agreement that we welcome, but they are only a step—and, let's face it, a step in the right direction. The right direction will be the removal of mandatory sentencing laws from the statute books not only of the Northern Territory but also of my home state, Western Australia. It is a very blunt instrument to be using in the law enforcement area, and it has been proved on a number of occasions that mandatory sentencing is just not working. </para><para>There are people who are very happy about the agreement, particularly backbenchers on the government side, and they are saying that no longer would juveniles be incarcerated for minor offences. The detail of that is not contained in yesterday's announcement. The detail is that the police have got certain powers to direct persons—young offenders—onto the diversionary programs if they so decide. Is it going to be compulsory or mandatory that the individuals be so diverted? If it is, will it mean that a 17-year-old can go on a rampage and end up on a diversionary program while an 18-year-old accompanying them will be automatically charged—because the police have no discretion over whether to charge or not to charge—and as a consequence will be faced with mandatory sentencing? It is a much more severe regime for adults than for juveniles in the Northern Territory.</para><para>That is not to say that we do not welcome the change in age, but the announcement yesterday does beg a whole host of questions, which are heightened when one looks back at the Senate committee's investigation and the questions that were asked of the representatives of the Northern Territory government about what was happening in the Northern Territory at the time. We wanted to know the number of young offenders who had been convicted and sentenced under the mandatory sentencing regime. After a matter of months we got some information but, even to this day, the public of the Northern Territory, this Senate, the parliament and the public of Australia do not know the number of offenders who were charged at 16 and sentenced as adults at 17 in the Northern Territory. That information is not yet available, and there is no public accountability contained in the joint announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Yet we are going to hand over $5 million a year—which is welcome—for the diversionary programs. The increased funding for the interpreter service is also welcome; it is a much needed thing that has not previously been in existence. We have had scenarios where individuals who did not understand English were being charged through the courts of the Northern Territory, convicted in the courts of the Northern Territory and sentenced under the mandatory sentencing regime when they did not understand what was happening. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13794</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.

It is a very serious matter that a UN organisation, the United Nations Population Fund, the UNFPA, responded to a specific request from Mr Milosevic for that organisation to come and operate only in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia. That followed a statement made by the Yugoslav minister for family concerns that the Kosovar women were just breeding machines and something needed to be done to limit or forbid—those were his words—the number of children that they are having.</para><para>When I specifically questioned the government about that organisation operating at the request of the war criminal Mr Milosevic and operating only in the Kosovo area, the department, which presumably was AusAID, came up with a pathetic response—which I am almost positive would not have been seen by the minister—not dealing with that key issue at all but suggesting the infant and maternal mortality rates in Kosovo are the highest in Europe. The department's response was that the UNFPA is `working to meet the urgent reproductive needs of refugees there' and that `maternal mortality rates are extremely high'. Rather than go to the causes of the maternal mortality rates, which are many in number—and I have mentioned this over a period of time in the Senate—the UNFPA's answer is, `Well, don't have any kids.' I have evidence from doctors in Kosovo which shows that hospitals had `everything they needed and were performing sterilisations and pregnancy terminations' and they had `all that they needed in respect of IUDs, manual vacuum aspirators' et cetera, but they lacked the essential life saving drugs and equipment because priority was being given by the UNFPA to the supply of birth control provisions, some of which were outdated—and I have evidence for that. The minister simply stated in response that `UNFPA has included providing laundry equipment to the maternity clinic at Pristina'. I think it was three washing machines or something like that. Millions of dollars are being spent for the other material, and only three or four washing machines for the clinic. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mandatory Sentencing</title><page.no>13795</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13795</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Greig today, relating to mandatory sentencing.</para></motion><para>In doing so, I want to express my very real disappointment that I seemingly cannot get a straight answer to a straight question on this issue. I am referring specifically to the first and key part of my question asked here today which was that, in spite of the conciliation and negotiation between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and our Prime Minister that resulted in a deal which we learned of yesterday, mandatory sentencing remains. I touched on that deal briefly. It in part included some $5 million of additional funding to the Northern Territory to assist with diversionary programs, in addition to which the definition of `juvenile' was slightly tinkered with so that 17-year-olds were no longer vulnerable as they previously were and the definition of an adult is now 18 years. I do welcome that. In terms of the $5 million funding, I maintain my argument that that is really a paltry amount of funding for the substantial difficulties and problems that are faced by many people in the Northern Territory in relation to the criminal laws, most particularly indigenous Northern Territorians. </para><para>I note also that a part of the package has resulted in an interpreter service being provided. I welcome that also but I feel a sense of shame, to be frank, that this was not there in the first instance. As has been noted in this chamber previously, if you happen to be an illegal immigrant landing on our shores then you are provided with an interpreter service in order to process the legalities that you would need to go through in terms of immigration or refugee status. Yet, if you are a first Australian and a juvenile offender in the Northern Territory, you had no right to that until recently. Again, I welcome this particular outcome of the negotiation but feel quite appalled that it was not there in the first instance. I acknowledge also that there will be more money available to diversionary programs, and that too is a good thing. But at the core of my question was simply this: in spite of all that, is it not the fact that mandatory sentencing laws still exist in the Northern Territory and Western Australia? From recollection, I do not think the minister answered that or answered that clearly.</para><para>That is at the core of my question because we either accept that mandatory sentencing per se is acceptable or it is not. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, of which I am a member, found in its inquiry and deliberations that mandatory sentencing laws clearly breach international treaties, most significantly in relation to CROC, the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It would appear that they would also be in contravention of CERD, the treaty relating to racial discrimination. I think we as a nation have to take such treaties very seriously. You can argue strongly that we did that in terms of speaking with state and territory governments prior to signing on to these treaties. As a nation, we have signed on to these basic benchmarks of human rights and dignity. Yet it is quite clear that the government is not serious in adhering to those, even when we have the most flagrant breaches, and this has most recently flared up in the Northern Territory. A joint press release issued yesterday between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Denis Burke, and Prime Minister John Howard stated, in part, in paragraph 6:</para><quote><para>The Northern Territory legislation will be amended so that a person will be treated as an adult from 18 years of age rather than at 17 years of age. Apart from this, the mandatory sentencing provisions of the existing law will remain unchanged.</para></quote><para>This begs the question: why bother? Why bother going to all this trouble to get additional funding for interpreter services, a special juvenile court and diversionary programs and why bother tinkering with the definition of `juveniles' and finding innovative ways of getting around this law, when it would have been far simpler, far more intelligent and more comprehensive, if we are to include Western Australia—and I think we must—to have simply repealed these laws in the first place rather than messing around with them at the edges? I am not alone in that view. </para><para>I note also that, following the announcement of the Prime Minister yesterday, the Law Council of Australia strongly criticised that, arguing that this was `simply political window dressing which, on the face of it, vests more power in the Territory's police force'. That was said by Dr Gordon Hughes, the Law Council spokesperson. The real remedy, he said, would have been to abolish mandatory sentencing and to restore judicial discretion to judicial officers in sentencing matters. I can only agree. The outstanding question to the minister is: do mandatory sentencing laws breach our international treaty obligations or do they not?</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>13796</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Alternative Regimes</title><page.no>13797</page.no><no.signed>8</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>8O6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>O'Brien</name></names></petitioninfo><quote><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of residents of the nation of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate that:</para><para>1.

practitioners and courts.</para><para>A separate cross-vesting scheme was subsequently established for matters arising under the Corporations Law.</para><para>The High Court decided in June last year, however, that the conferral of State jurisdiction on the Federal and Family Courts under the general and corporations law cross-vesting arrangements is not permitted by the Constitution.</para><para>The decision, which is known as Re Wakim, was regrettable.</para><para>In undermining the cross-vesting arrangements which I have mentioned, and a number of other co-operative arrangements, it undermined arrangements which have permitted a significant growth in national co-operation between the States, and between the States and the Commonwealth. </para><para>Re Wakim has had a particularly negative effect in relation to the Corporations Law scheme, significantly reducing the Federal Court's involvement.</para><para>The special cross-vesting arrangements were regarded as a fundamental element of the fully integrated system of State, Territory and federal adjudication contemplated by the Corporations Agreement.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum for the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 - which introduced the special cross-vesting arrangements - confirmed that they were intended `to enhance the national character of the new scheme'.</para><para>The cross-vesting arrangements were regarded as `central to the conferral of a national character' on the corporations law scheme.</para><para>The Commonwealth Parliament cannot restore all of the elements of the cross-vesting arrangements which were affected by Re Wakim.</para><para>It lacks constitutional power to do so.</para><para>In recognition of this constitutional fact, the States have all enacted legislation, the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Acts, which give effect to past ineffective decisions of federal courts as if they had been made by State courts.</para><para>The State legislation also provides for proceedings invalidly commenced in federal courts to be transferred to State courts.</para><para>Co-operative measures are also being explored.</para><para>An appropriate referral of power by the States to the Commonwealth under subsection 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution would address the loss of the Federal Court's Corporations Law jurisdiction.</para><para>A fully integrated national corporations law scheme, reflecting the existing co-operative approach to regulation and amendment, could be established by the Commonwealth if the State parliaments were prepared to refer the necessary power.</para><para>To this end, Commonwealth officers have begun work on a proposal for a suitable referral.</para><para>A detailed proposal will be developed in consultation with the States and Territories for consideration by Commonwealth, State and Territory ministers.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SCHEDULES 1, 3 AND 4 TO THE BILL: RESPONSE TO RE WAKIM</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth can take more immediate steps to address some of the problems created by Re Wakim.</para><para>That is what this Bill does.</para><para>The first and most obvious step is to repeal the now invalid provisions of Commonwealth laws that purport to consent to the conferral of State jurisdiction on federal courts.</para><para>This is done in Schedule 1 to the Bill.</para><para>The Commonwealth Parliament may also take steps to confer jurisdiction on any court to review decisions made by Commonwealth officers, whether in the exercise of powers conferred by State or Commonwealth laws.</para><para>The Commonwealth can thus ensure that the Federal Court continues to play an important part in the co-operative arrangements already mentioned.</para><para>Commonwealth officers and authorities are invested with powers by State law under various co-operative arrangements.</para><para>Indeed, this has been a common feature of the co-operative federalism that has evolved over recent years.</para><para>Under the Corporations Law, for example, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, a Commonwealth authority, is invested with powers and functions by States.</para><para>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is also invested with powers and functions by States under State Competition Policy Reform Acts and State Price Exploitation Codes.</para><para>Since the establishment of the Federal Court, it has been accepted that the Federal Court, rather than State courts or tribunals, generally should have the function of reviewing the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers and authorities.</para><para>I shall discuss what is perhaps the only significant exception to this general policy later, in relation to Schedule 2 and criminal prosecutions in State or Territory courts.</para><para>Accordingly, where States conferred jurisdiction on Commonwealth officers and authorities under various co-operative schemes, federal courts were given jurisdiction.</para><para>The policy was clear.</para><para>The Commonwealth administrative law regime should apply to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers and authorities.</para><para>Federal courts and tribunals should review the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers and authorities.</para><para>The means chosen before Re Wakim to give effect to this policy was for the States to adopt as State law relevant Commonwealth administrative laws.</para><para>The particular laws adopted varied in each case, but would involve one or all of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1988 or the Ombudsman Act 1976. </para><para>The Federal Court was then invested with State jurisdiction to hear matters under this applied legislation.</para><para>However, the decision in Re Wakim meant that this approach no longer works.</para><para>In so far as the adoption of Commonwealth administrative laws by States also involves conferral of State jurisdiction on the Federal Court, it is invalid.</para><para>Schedule 1 to the Bill resolves this problem.</para><para>It amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975.</para><para>The amendments bring the decisions and actions of Commonwealth officers and authorities under certain States laws within the scope of these Commonwealth Acts.</para><para>The Federal Court, when exercising jurisdiction in relation to these decisions and actions, will be exercising federal jurisdiction, not State jurisdiction.</para><para>This means that the Federal Court will continue to fulfil its role as the primary forum for review of the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers and authorities.</para><para>State and Territory Supreme Courts will be given equivalent federal jurisdiction in limited circumstances.</para><para>This limited jurisdiction is intended simply to avoid `splitting' judicial review proceedings and substantive proceedings between federal and State and Territory courts where the substantive proceedings must be brought in the State or Territory court.</para><para>I note in passing that, while Re Wakim invalidated the conferral of State jurisdiction on federal courts, it did not invalidate the conferral by Commonwealth law of Territory jurisdiction on those courts.</para><para>The Bill, however, treats Territories in the same way as States, in order to achieve uniform federal coverage of matters under State and Territory laws.</para><para>It has already been noted that the Territories were consulted in developing this approach, and had no objections.</para><para>Schedules 3 and 4 also address consequences of Re Wakim.</para><para>Following Re Wakim, an unintended consequence of amendments of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 made by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999 is that actions for misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to securities can no longer be brought in the Federal Court.</para><para>Schedule 3 will reinstate the Federal Court's jurisdiction under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act by reference to the new Corporations Law actions.</para><para>The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act also inserted s.659B in the Corporations Law.</para><para>It was designed to ensure that the Corporations and Securities Panel would be the primary forum for resolving takeover disputes under the Corporations Law, in order to allow such disputes to be resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible by a specialist body largely comprised of takeover experts.</para><para>Section 659B was designed to prevent legal proceedings in relation to a takeover bid, including judicial review of Panel decisions under any State administrative laws, before the end of the bid period.</para><para>Only proceedings commenced on the application of ASIC, or another public authority of the Commonwealth or a State, were to be exempted.</para><para>Schedule 4 is necessary given other amendments in this Bill to give effect to the original policy behind section 659B.</para><para>Proposed section 59A of the Corporations Act will give section 659B of the Corporations Law additional force under the Corporations Act as a Commonwealth law applying to the Federal Court.</para><para><inline

Prosecutions, or a member of the Director's staff, to exercise rights of appeal conferred under State or Territory law in relation to prosecutions for State or Territory offences.</para><para>It will put beyond doubt the Director's rights of appeal in relation to proceedings for summary conviction in respect of Commonwealth offences.</para><para>And it will put beyond doubt the Director's authority to carry on or respond to appeals instituted by others in relation to such proceedings.</para><para>The amendments will thus restore what had been thought to be the situation before the

sentence imposed by the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Mr Alan Bond for breaches of the Western Australian Companies Code.</para><para>In particular, the amendments will allow a role under Commonwealth law for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Office of the Director, in relation to prosecutions and appeals under the Companies Code considered in the Bond

PROCESS</inline></para><para>Schedule 2 to the Bill deals with judicial review of decisions in federal, State and Territory courts, but in the specific context of criminal prosecution.</para><para>The object is to avoid the use of unmeritorious delaying tactics in the criminal justice process, by removing the `collateral' access of defendants to federal administrative law procedures and remedies.</para><para>Schedule 2 contains amendments of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Corporations Act 1989 and the Judiciary Act 1903 that will, in federal criminal matters, restrict defendants' access to administrative law remedies.</para><para>Defendants will not be able to use the ADJR Act to challenge decisions to prosecute.</para><para>Nor will they be able to use that Act to challenge other decisions in the criminal justice process after a prosecution or appeal has commenced.</para><para>Further, defendants in State and Territory courts will not be able to rely on section 39B of the Judiciary Act to bring an application in the Federal Court to review decisions of Commonwealth officers made in the prosecution process.</para><para>The 39B jurisdiction will in that case be removed from the Federal Court and conferred on State and Territory Supreme Courts.</para><para>Section 39B of the Judiciary Act is currently a provision of general application which allows Federal Court action for mandamus, prohibition or an injunction against an officer of the Commonwealth.</para><para>This same jurisdiction is constitutionally entrenched as part of the High Court's original jurisdiction under subsection 75(v) of the Constitution.</para><para>If the 39B jurisdiction in relation to prosecutions in State and Territory courts were not removed from the Federal Court, and conferred instead on State and Territory Supreme Courts, the opportunity to disrupt and delay those prosecutions by repeated, unmeritorious applications to a different court system

This should not be taken as indicating any acceptance by this chamber of the view, which has occasionally been put by government advisers, that where there are substantive amendments and requests they should all be put as requests.

I do not want to go over all of that again. The minister was in the chamber and Senator Bartlett was in the chamber.

I think any thinking person would have to agree that it is not a good way to go. I remind the committee that parliament passed legislation introducing the 10 per cent threshold for the sharing of the family tax benefit in June last year, and there was unanimous support. </para></talk.start><para>We are in the process of sending an information package to 2.3 million families. I do not have a copy of it with me now, but I can assure you that it is printed and it is on its way out to people. Over one million families have already received this package. The mail-out to families is based on the legislation that was passed by this Senate unanimously last year, and it is telling families about a whole range of matters, including shared care. The families are requested to complete and return a claim form based on the information that is in the package. Information in the package includes comprehensive details about the shared care arrangements that were passed, as I said, in June last year. </para><para>The ALP's proposed amendments would move the sharing threshold to 30 per cent and allow sharing of payment at a lower level on application, but only with the agreement of both separated parents. It is superficially attractive. I recognise that, on the face of it, it seems quite a reasonable thing to try. But it is not, and the sad thing is that the amendments would result in up to 5,500 losers among parents with less than 30 per cent care who are already receiving family allowance. So it is really a serious matter. The parliament passed legislation, Centrelink sent out an information package to parents, and one million families have already received the package. They are being asked to fill in their details and send them back to Centrelink, but there will be 5,500 losers among parents who are already getting family allowance. </para><para>The proposed amendments would give power to one parent, and to me this is one of the most serious things about it. The administrative things are important, of course, the confusion for parents is important, and the losers are important, but this would give power to one parent in an area of great emotion—as we were saying yesterday when we were debating changes to the child support legislation. When parents have separated they want their children properly supported, they want to have time with them, and they want to be a real parent to them. This is an area which is fraught with emotion already, but the ALP amendments would give veto power to one parent. If that parent has between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of care, they could determine the financial circumstances of their former partner, who has up to 30 per cent care of the child. Is that reasonable? In a perfect world, everybody would be gracious. There has never been this requirement before, and it is not the requirement now. This is now administered in an impartial way by Centrelink. There is no ability by one parent to veto the arrangements for the other parent, and I would have thought that the ALP would have realised that this would be the impact. I am sure they would not have agreed to it if they had known. As the payment could be shared only by agreement of both separated parents, the proposed amendment would create an environment of dispute between the parents that is not in the current system. There are disputes enough, and the current system does not give an opportunity for a further dispute in this area. </para><para>If you are going to ensure fairness, it is essential that a parent's entitlement to family assistance be determined by the Family Assistance Office, not at the discretion of a former partner. The amendment would put at risk the entitlements of parents. Let us not forget that these are parents who are making the effort to have substantial, ongoing care arrangements for their child or children, such as every weekend or every second weekend plus half the school holidays. We are all very sad if children lose the benefit of the second parent in their lives, but where a parent is really trying to make the effort to maintain meaningful contact with the children who are with their former spouse, that parent is trying to do the right thing by their kids. Sharing the care by having the children every weekend or every second weekend and half the school holidays is a pretty typical arrangement between families who do not have insurmountable relationship problems which keep them from doing the best thing by their children.</para><para>Any change now would jeopardise the proper implementation of the legislation. It would result in increased administrative costs to alter work that is already well under way. It would also increase the ongoing cost of administration. The initial estimates that have been provided to me by my department are that the cost would be $23.7 million in 2000-01 and $21 million in subsequent years. Ten per cent, as is in their legislation, is a reasonable test of material care, recognising of course that parents with this level of care do incur significant costs in caring for their children. But, whatever the level, we should surely be encouraging it.</para><para>Recent Australian research does show that parents with this level of care or more incur relatively significant costs due to the need to provide a bedroom, furnishings, food, clothes, health care and entertainment. The 1996 family law reforms were introduced with the intention of promoting the parenting role of both parents and their continuing role in the lives of their children following separation. Surely this Senate will not lightly walk away from that commitment to children, to the parents who love them and to the parents who are trying to do the right thing by them. Surely, having agreed to a legislative arrangement last June, we will not at the eleventh hour send everything into confusion, produce 5,500 losers and damage the relationship between the two spouses who are trying to have an agreement that works for their children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>13810</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister's comments about damaging relationships, et cetera, are unfortunate.

I do not think anyone argues—I do not think you would, Minister—that the percentage of care automatically corresponds with the percentage of the costs. One of the concerns that we have is that 10 per cent represents less than one day a week. So I suspect that, in the majority of cases where this is applied, it represents one weekend a fortnight in terms of the care arrangements I am familiar with regarding children in these sorts of arrangements. Therefore, you have to make a judgment about whether or not they are meeting the full share that the percentage of care represents in terms of the costs, given that the custodial parent is providing the majority of care, purchasing the clothes, providing the education—doing those sorts of things. That is why we have some concerns about the arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>But I want to take you back to this question as to who the losers are out of your proposition.

You were quite disparaging about our attempt to talk about parents coming together and reaching agreement. I accept that those things are difficult, but your provision is to automatically take 10 per cent of the payment off those custodial parents. I am not sure that that is a fairer or more rational way. You have not even consulted those parents about whether they want that to occur. What you are saying to me is that you will do that automatically, and I am not sure that that is a preferable outcome. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>13812</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think that is a misreading of what the government is doing.

I heard what Senator Evans had to say about the costs of, if you like, the principal carer, but there are quite substantial costs for anybody who is caring for a child every second weekend, half the holidays or every weekend. I understand that, in percentage terms, that is in the mid to upper 20s—approaching 30 per cent. That is a major commitment of your time to your children but it is also a major cost in providing two homes for your children. But do not forget that, in addition to this, the person who is giving, if you like, the secondary care is also providing financial support for the primary carer to enable that education that they are providing or whatever else that you mentioned. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—And that is calculated elsewhere, is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is calculated elsewhere but you have to factor this in.

If you have parents who are prepared to provide not only what they are required to give by law—that is, their child support payments—but also a meaningful secondary home for their children, they are spending a lot of money and time on their children. Do you suggest that that should not be reflected in the payment that would go to that parent for the proportion of time they are actually giving? I am really only concerned that you are allowing a veto between parents who may have difficulties about access and difficulties from time to time about whether child support payments are late or not—you know the typical patterns; that you are putting a veto on the secondary carer getting their entitlement for the percentage of time they are actually giving to care.

I guess I am starting from a point of needing to be convinced. Firstly, I want to get to this issue that we are overturning something that the parliament agreed to when we passed the Family Assistance Act in, I think, June last year. I accept that it is possible for people to have inadvertently accepted something that they did not realise was in there, particularly given everything that was happening at that particular time, and that the introduction of that fairly major piece of legislation was put through fairly quickly. There were all sorts of reasons for that, and I am not necessarily criticising that process. But, even looking at it now, I am not able to see how this very significant change to implement a new shared care arrangement with this 10 per cent threshold was contained within that legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Section 25 of the act mentions a 10 per cent threshold. But, as I read it, that is basically there as a cut-off point to prevent people being able to claim to be the sole claimant of the family tax benefit rather than necessarily to implement a whole new pattern of shared care and shared payment. It is certainly not something that was referred to in the second reading speech and it seems to me quite a significant change. I would ask the minister to outline exactly where in the existing legislation this whole shared care arrangement with the 10 per cent threshold is. What component of the legislation that we agreed to last year is she suggesting that we are completely overturning? Is it simply section 25 or is there some other part of it that I have not picked up on properly? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>13813</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In answering Senator Bartlett's questions about the consideration by parliament last year, this is a useful opportunity to put on the record just what did happen. The inclusion of a 10 per cent threshold was clearly stated in the legislation that was passed in June last year. The particular section involved was section 25 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999. It was also clearly described in the explanatory memorandum for the bill, with an example of how it would operate. The legislation was considered by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, as you might recall. The committee received submissions from four organisations, a public hearing was held on 13 May 1999 and it reported later that month. One of the submissions, which came from ACOSS, noted in relation to the treatment of shared care that the introduction of a new structure of family assistance `provides an opportunity to make progress towards a more suitable system than we currently have'. The Senate thus had the opportunity to examine and to raise with the government any concerns that it had on the eligibility rules for family tax benefit, and no such concerns were raised at that time in relation to shared care.</para></talk.start><para>Going on to the further questions that Senator Bartlett asked, I said earlier that the opposition's amendment is superficially attractive because it does have the appearance of trying to strike a reasonable balance as to the situations in which payment can be shared below a 30 per cent threshold—and Senator Bartlett was asking about thresholds—but it fails to acknowledge that there is not currently a 30 per cent threshold for family allowance, which is the main payment that is being rolled into the family tax benefit. The opposition have been trying to paint a picture that family allowance is based on a 30 per cent threshold, and I think that is perhaps because they make a connection with the child support legislation, which stands separately. Therefore, they would paint a picture that the government is thereby reducing the threshold to 10 per cent. The true picture is that there is no threshold percentage for family allowance now. </para><para>The amendment from the opposition fails to make it clear that the proposed discretion to allow sharing between 10 per cent and 30 per cent will not apply at all for many parents. The reason for that is the secretary's discretion can only apply if both parents agree for the secretary to determine a percentage between 10 and 30 per cent, and if one parent does not agree then the discretion does not apply. I do not think that is what you really want, Senator Evans. I cannot imagine you do. I would urge you to think again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>13813</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to go back to the original issue of section 25 in the existing act, which the minister quoted. Section 30 of that legislation specifically stated that only one individual was eligible for the family tax benefit at the same time. It would seem to me that was the wording of what was in the then bill at the time. I know this amending bill seeks to remove section 30 but the bill that we agreed to last year specifically stated that only one individual would be eligible for the family tax benefit at any one time, as I read it. So, in terms of the argument of what the Senate actually unanimously agreed to last year, I think that puts it in a bit of a different situation in terms of this fundamental issue of whether or not we are moving to a system of splitting the family tax benefit between two different people. </para></talk.start><para>I acknowledge what the minister is saying about the existing arrangements under family allowance but, of course, there are different arrangements in relation to child support legislation and a number of other existing payments. The current family tax payment uses 30 per cent, child support uses a 30 per cent minimum and I think a number of other payments provide no opportunity for splitting at all. So it still seems to me that it is not so much an issue of whether or not we should have a shared care component in the legislation perhaps but where that percentage line is, which is what the amendment that we are discussing goes to. It still seems to me to be a significant shift to go to 10 per cent. Perhaps the minister could outline a bit more why 10 per cent is such a good idea and why 30 per cent is not. That might provide some assistance.</para><para>Section 30 of last year's bill does not prevent the sharing of the family tax benefit. It may be useful if I read out the reference in the explanatory memorandum of last year's bill. An example of the operation of section 25 is the situation where parents are separated and one parent, parent A, has the care of the child at all times except for one weekend every month, which is when the other parent, parent B—pursuant to a contact order—has the care of the child. In this scenario, there is a pattern of care each month, during which the child is an FTB child of two individuals at different times during the period. In this scenario, parent B has the care of the child for two days each month—that is, less than the 10 per cent requirement in section 25. Parent B would therefore not be eligible for FTB for the child for the two days each month during which time the child was in his or her care. In this scenario, the secretary would have the discretion to determine that parent A was eligible for FTB for the child for the two contact days of parent B. But, of course, under the amendments coming forward from the opposition, that secretarial discretion would not work unless the parents were agreed.</para><para>In response directly to Senator Bartlett about the 10 per cent issue, I would argue that 10 per cent is a reasonable test of material care. You must recognise that, even at that level of care, caring for the child incurs significant costs which cannot be ignored. Remember that this parent is also being required to pay child support, so it is in that context. Research that has been done quite recently in Australia shows that parents with that level of care or more incur relatively significant costs, because they need to provide a bedroom, they need appropriate furnishing for children of different ages, they need to provide food and clothes, and children get sick with parent B as they do with parent A. Of course, they also want to have some entertainment together. You must acknowledge that 10 per cent is a reasonable test of material care—after all, we want to encourage the maximum amount of contact. Ideally, we would like them to have fifty-fifty contact, or we would like them to live together and not have any of these arrangements. But surely we do not discourage somebody who, perhaps because of their own ill-health or disability or because of huge work commitments, has limited contact. For some people at a particular stage of life, it is very difficult to put in much more than 10 per cent. But, if you do not give them any recognition that that 10 per cent is significant in the child's life, you are sending a message of `Why bother?' to that parent. I fear that we would not be able to build on that as the relationship developed. It seems to me that even 10 per cent is to be encouraged and supported so that that percentage may grow, as and when the opportunity presents itself for that parent to give more time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13814</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a couple of comments.

The arbitrary decision is that they will receive 90 per cent to 10 per cent—that is one of the points I am making. To get back to the central point, I understand that the government applied a 70 per cent-30 per cent split arrangement for many years. That applied in the child support legislation, it applied in the family tax initiative and it applied in the family allowance until the Federal Court decision. It seems to me that the onus is on the government to prove why we should move from the 70-30 split to the 90-10 proposition they are advocating currently. The government have to prove why we ought to move to that. The minister has made some arguments as to what they are doing administratively, but I think the key issue is that the minister has to establish the efficacy of splitting allowances at that low level of care. Traditionally, we have not split allowances at that low level of care. The 70-30 split has been accepted in other legislation. As I said, it applied in the family allowance until it was knocked off in the courts. It applied in the family tax initiative, as I understand it. We are moving to a lower level of care at which we decide to split the payment. That is a decision for this parliament to make, but the onus is on the minister to prove the case for that. We heard some reference to research. The staff of the shadow minister responsible, Mr Swan, asked for that research when they were briefed about the justification for the 10 per cent level. In explaining it then, the minister asked the rhetorical question, `Surely you would agree that 10 per cent is reasonable?' It seems to me that you have to make the case. Surely I would agree that 30 per cent is reasonable, or 20 per cent or 15 per cent. The point is that you are making a change; you have to convince the parliament on what basis that change should be made.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—I'm not—you are.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—I argue that you are making a change.

I have not seen you there, but I have been there for hours. The point is that this is complex legislation. There are hundreds and hundreds of pages of legislation, and I do not think any minister of the Crown pretends to be on top of every part of the detail, let alone expects every senator or every member of the committee to be. This is the first time that we have had a debate about what we see as a substantial change in approach—that is, about the question of shared care. Senator Bartlett is quite right to say that that went through to the keeper. We did not have a debate about it. It seems that we are able to make changes to parenting payment conditions on the run. The integrity of the package, the integrity of the information mailed out to Australian families, seems to be able to be altered if the government is under enough political pressure to allow for the parenting payment changes. So it seems to me that the argument that the minister adopts about the previous debate on the legislation and about the information is not really convincing. I have got the booklet in front of me now, and I do not think that the sort of proposition we are advocating today would cause too much difficulty.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister has not been able to give us the details of who are the losers from the government's change. I think that is an important consideration, and saying that you do not know or that you cannot find out just seems a bit too cute. The minister always seems to have a big figure and a big dollar cost for anything the Democrats or the opposition put up, but cannot tell us about the downside of the government's arrangements. The onus is back on the government to prove why we ought to be making these splits in payments at what are relatively low levels of care; levels which traditionally we have not applied, which we do not apply in the child support legislation and which we have not applied previously in the family area. To make the case, the minister made a passing reference to research. I would like to see it—there was no specific reference. What is it that justifies moving to that low level?</para><para>As I have said all along, it is a balancing act. I have not made any great claims for the Labor amendments. It is a judgment call about such things. This is a very complex area. We think one of the advantages of our approach is that it does encourage parents to work these things through together. We say that the government's approach is arbitrary in that arbitrarily thousands of people who currently receive the payment will have their payment reduced from 100 per cent to 90 per cent, even if the other partner has not applied or does not want it. That seems to me terribly arbitrary. So the claims that we are removing discretion do not sit well with what you are doing. You are immediately removing discretion. You are arbitrarily saying that they will lose 10 per cent of their payment if they have shared care, whereas they might be receiving 100 per cent now. </para><para>As I say, it is a judgment call. I do not think we have had the debate. I think it is an important issue which we should have debated the first time. I accept some responsibility that we did not have that debate then, that we did not pick it up in the first round of this package of legislation. It is the parliament's role to make those decisions. We do need to make this one. I think the onus is on the government to establish why we should move to the 90-10 split, given what they have done in other legislation and in previous legislation in this area in the life of this government. I do not think that case has been made out. We think the 70-30 split, which has a bit of a precedent to it, is a better arrangement and that is what we argue for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>13816</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The senator asked about the basis on which we talk about the costs of sharing care. I draw to his attention policy research paper No. 75, published by the Department of Family and Community Services in May 1999, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The behaviour and expenditures of non-resident parents during contact visits</inline>. It was produced under contract to the department by Murray Woods and Associates. I think that, in the interval when this legislation goes across to the House of Representatives, if this amendment were to be passed—I hope it will not be—perhaps it would be beneficial for the opposition to have a look at that paper as to why we would say that people providing 10 per cent of care should get that recognition in the system. That is the law now. That is what parents are being told is the law now and one million of them have already received that information in their letterboxes.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Evans referred to another issue, too, about discretion and about parents getting the fair percentage of care. There is a discretion in existing legislation that, if a parent has less than 10 per cent of care, the other parent can get 100 per cent. They have to meet at least the threshold of 10 per cent in order to get a share of the payment. The government would say that non-resident parents are trying to have contact with their children and, if we do not recognise that, we are sending a message which many men in Australia feel they are getting already. We heard only yesterday in the debate from Senator Harris, who was obviously speaking for a lot of people who feel disaffected by the family law system and the child support system, et cetera. If people are providing at least 10 per cent of care, this parliament has passed a clause which entitles non-custodial parents to get financial recognition for that. If this parliament were to overturn that, you will have even more people who are dissatisfied with the system. There are men who feel that the entire system is against them, and I do not think we want to encourage that attitude in Australia. We have all seen what it has led to in political activity from people who are obviously emotionally very disturbed by the break-up of their families.</para><para>This legislation has been passed by this Senate after a committee inquiry and the tabling of an explanatory memorandum which spelt out exactly what was happening. There was no attempt to hide it. If, on the eve of the new system, you take this away from people who are providing that care, I think that would be very unjust. This is not something which is a matter for party politics. I think it is very seriously a matter of supporting and cherishing families who have been through a lot of hard times by the time they get to this stage; it is a matter of saying that the parliament of Australia believes that even 10 per cent of care is better for kids than no care from the second parent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13817</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is probably best not to get into that whole debate about how fathers are perceiving they are being treated by child support as opposed to how mothers feel they are being treated, because it is a very difficult debate, as all people here would acknowledge.

Nonetheless, I recognise very much the views and perceptions that the minister just mentioned in relation to people who do not have primary care of their child. I am sure she would acknowledge that there are also very strong feelings amongst people who do have primary care of their child about how the system is treating them, and we need to consider those as well in terms of what their perceptions are about any changes that may be made. I am sure the minister would be aware that there are some perceptions that this 10 per cent threshold is an extra blow for primary caregivers. </para></talk.start><para>I will not redebate the meaning of the existing section 30, but in terms of how it reads, where it specifically deals with the situation of two individuals who are not members of the same couple and are not living together, only one can be eligible for FTB in respect of that child at any given time. It still seems to me to read very much to prevent a splitting of the FTB payment. I do not necessarily want to disagree on that, backwards and forwards, ad infinitum.</para><para>There is one other question I would like to put to the minister. This original family assistance act was brought in as part of a very large number of bills that were part of the new tax system. I am sure each of us has different views about that overall new tax system but, again, there is not much point in revisiting that debate now. As part of people's assessments about the desirability and the overall fairness of that new tax system, there was a lot of modelling done by different people and differing economists. There was a lot of modelling published by the government demonstrating how people would all be better off. I just want to see an indication from them as to whether any of that modelling specifically included people getting only 90 per cent or 75 per cent of the new family tax benefit rather than 100 per cent, as might have been expected. I want to know whether that assessment of the `losers' Senator Evans was talking about will mean their payments will be reduced by a percentage—they will not lose it altogether, but it will be reduced by a percentage—and whether that reduction was factored in to any of the modelling that was done by Access Economics, NATSEM or whoever else at that time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>13817</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, Senator, you referred to section 30 in last year's legislation.

I accept the minister's bona fides in making that offer, and I appreciate that, but I think we would want something a bit more substantial.

In terms of the way forward, I am of a mind at this stage to support the ALP amendment. It does not worry me whether the minister wants to have the vote taken and we pass the bill then talk it through while it goes back to the House of Representatives, or whether she wants to adjourn the bill now and we talk through firming up what she has suggested. Either way, we want to nail down a little more specifically how that process might best work before we back away from supporting the amendment. It does not really worry me whether the minister wants to do that through adjourning the bill while we figure that out or whether she wants to pass the bill and give the House of Representatives something useful to do for a change.

I do not really agree that we could move down an adjournment track. With other legislation coming along behind, it will get swept aside and have difficulty getting back onto the list.

That proviso goes to issuing a strong recommendation to the government to consider certain matters that fundamentally relate to Australian jobs and services in rural and regional Australia. I will come to those matters in a bit more detail when I address the opposition's amendment. I am presuming that the minister is on the way to the chamber, although with this minister one never knows.</para></talk.start><para>This bill contains two schedules. Schedule 1 contains the proposed changes to liberalise the foreign ownership restrictions of Australian airlines. It also contains other minor technical amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920. I will return to address this schedule later. Schedule 2 of the bill increases some of the penalties for breaching curfew legislation at Sydney airport. These amendments increase five-fold the maximum penalty for taking off or landing at Sydney airport in breach of the curfew in the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995. The effect of these amendments is to increase the penalty for an individual operator from 200 penalty units to 1,000 penalty units. For a company, the increase is from 1,000 penalty units to 5,000 penalty units. In dollar terms, the new maximum penalty for an individual operating an aircraft in breach of the curfew will be $110,000 and for a company it will be $550,000. The amendments in items 3 and 4 of schedule 2 apply new maximum penalties for taking off between 10.45 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. from a runway not permitted by the act. These new maxima in section 10 of the act also represent a five-fold increase. They will now be $55,000 for an individual and $275,000 for a company.</para><para>It is interesting to note that the maximum penalty for breaching some other restrictions imposed by the act has not been changed. I am not sure where the minister is. Hopefully, he may be listening. Missing in action again, perhaps? I draw the minister's attention to the failure of the bill to increase the penalties in section 11. That section imposes a penalty for taking off or landing on a runway not permitted by the act between 6.00 a.m. and 7.00 a.m. or between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on a Saturday or a Sunday. Whilst the penalties for that section are the same as in the existing section 10, the government has not seen fit to increase these penalties. Other penalties have not changed, such as those for failing to lodge notices for landing noisy aircraft during the curfew or providing false or misleading information. I would normally call on the minister to explain these apparent anomalies. I am not sure if Senator Herron is sufficiently versed. Perhaps, if he is responding in relation to this legislation he could seek advice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Herron is not.

While he is on his feet explaining this apparent oversight in the policy, I also invite him to discuss the situation at Adelaide airport. At the last session of this chamber, we passed the private member's bill of the member for Hindmarsh in relation to the curfew for Adelaide airport. For the final reading of that bill, the <inline ref="R753">Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1999</inline>, the member for Hindmarsh declined the opposition's offer to work jointly to legislate for the provision of insulation for houses and public buildings affected by noise in the same way as for Sydney residents. The opposition calls on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services to declare a commitment to a combined effort to address that anomalous situation as well. An early indication of how much support the minister has for the new curfew at Adelaide has caused the opposition some concern, and while the minister is on his feet, he may elaborate in relation to that. In a press report in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> of 26 March 2000, it was reported that the curfew was broken to assist Ansett to juggle its schedules because of a stop-work meeting. It seems to the opposition that that would not have fitted the criteria for emergencies agreed to by the parliament. But I invite the minister to explain what happened there—if he comes to the Senate.</para><para>In conclusion, I reiterate the opposition's support for the changes to schedule 2, incomplete as they are. It is not our job to tidy that up; it is the government's responsibility to do that and we call on it to do so. I appreciate there is some evidence provided to the courts that some airlines—and I stress that this is probably a very few—have seen fit or may in the future see fit to ignore the curfew as a cheaper option than delaying a take-off or arrival. It is unfortunate that some show such a lack of consideration for residents. For some, of course, only money talks and for that reason we support an increase in the penalties described. I move:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>“but that the Senate, while supportive of the amendment to adjust foreign ownership rules under the <inline font-style="italic">Air Navigation Act 1920</inline>, considers that in examining a proposal for the sale of shares in Ansett to foreign interests, the Government should take into consideration the view that:</para><para>(a)	Ansett Australia should remain headquartered in Australia;</para><para>(b)	a fair share of future growth in routes should be through Ansett International;</para><para>(c)	high skilled, high value Ansett airlines jobs should remain in Australia;</para><para>(d)	Ansett jobs in regional and rural communities not be jeopardised by the sale; and</para><para>(e)	services to regional and rural communities should be preserved at current levels, or improved”.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>13821</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has been mentioned, the <inline ref="R1011">Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> deals with two particular issues. Firstly, it increases the maximum penalties payable for breaching the Sydney airport curfew. The penalties will increase by a factor of five. The rationale for this is that it is thought that the current level of fines does not have sufficient deterrent effect. I will refrain at this point from opening the Pandora's box of debate on airport noise other than to say that the Democrats support the increase in penalties.</para></talk.start><para>The second issue with which the bill deals is foreign ownership restrictions relating to Australian international airlines. I should note that the bill does not impact on the ownership of Qantas, although presumably the amendments which we propose to give force to today may stand as some sort of precedent in respect of Qantas ownership. Currently the Air Navigation Act 1920 limits the ownership of shares in an Australian international airline to no more than 25 per cent for an individual foreign airline and to no more than 35 per cent in total for all foreign airlines. The bill proposes to remove these restrictions, replacing them with a simple requirement that no more than 49 per cent of an Australian international airline may be owned by foreign persons. These proposals come at a time when Air New Zealand is proposing to acquire News Corporation's shareholding in Ansett Holdings, giving it 100 per cent ownership of Ansett's domestic operations and 49 per cent of Ansett's international operations. The Australian Democrats do not oppose the liberalisation of the foreign ownership restrictions. They will, I believe, result in increased freedom of Australian international airlines to access global equity markets and thus expand globally and compete in the international market. For that reason we support this bill.</para><para>I would like, though, to comment on two issues arising out of this measure. The first is a procedural matter and the second is a substantive one. These amendments follow from the Productivity Commission report into international air services and the International Air Services Commission report provided to the government on 11 September 1998. It took the government some nine months—until 3 June 1999—to respond to that report and it took a further nine months to draft what appears to be a very straightforward piece of legislation. Subsequent to that, and as a clear result of the proposal by Air New Zealand to buy Ansett, this legislation takes on an incredible priority, which I do not think it can be argued that it would not have had were it not for this transaction being in the wings—pun unintended.</para><para>This bill had to be exempted from the provisions of standing order 111. That standing order was put in place, I understand, so that legislation would remain on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for a sufficient period to allow public scrutiny and for the public to make representations in accordance with ordinary democratic processes. This legislation was only introduced into the House of Representatives, and consequently publicly available, on 8 March 2000—just five weeks ago. The point I make is that the democratic processes of the Senate and of the parliament should not be curtailed to make up for the dilatory action of the government.</para><para>The substantive issue I raise relates to the second reading amendment that the opposition has circulated and to which Senator Mackay has spoken. I foreshadow that we will be supporting that amendment. The Australian Democrats are concerned about the potential impact that foreign ownership of our international airlines will have on employment, skills and services in this country. There is also some concern, which I share, that the head office of any Australian international airline should remain in Australia. The action by the Labor Party in circulating its second reading amendment is to be commended, but the Democrats would like to go one step further and put our concerns in the legislation. We would like to entrench in the legislation a requirement that the Treasurer be satisfied as to certain factors when making his decision as to whether or not to approve the transaction as being in the national interest.</para><para>At present the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act requires that the Treasurer's approval be obtained when a certain level of shareholding is being acquired by a foreign person. When the Treasurer is considering a transaction which involves a foreign person purchasing an airline, the Democrats believe that the Treasurer should be substantially satisfied that the following goals will be met: firstly, that the headquarters of the airline should remain in Australia; secondly, that highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry should also remain in Australia; thirdly, that jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised; and, fourthly, that services to rural and regional communities should be maintained and, if possible, improved.</para><para>I will digress for a moment and say that it would, of course, have been our preference and would perhaps have been more appropriate from a drafting perspective for these factors to have been contained in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. However, given that that act is not the subject of amendment and debate today through this legislation, these provisions will need to be enacted as part of the Air Navigation Act. I would add that they would have precisely the same effect if they formed part of the Air Navigation Act as they would have if they formed part of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. This amendment is a logical and reasonable extension of Labor's second reading amendment.</para><para>It has been indicated to me that the Labor Party will be opposing the Democrat amendment. I confess that that perplexes me a little, but I will pursue that a little later at the committee stage. I indicate again that the Democrats support the opposition amendment to the motion before the chair and will support the second reading of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13822</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, I am sure you are delighted to be in the chair when we are discussing the aviation industry, given your recent experience with the aviation industry and, indeed, mine. I wish to speak to the <inline ref="R1011">Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> for a number of reasons, not the least being that air travel is the lifeblood of regional centres like Launceston in my state of Tasmania. Without regular air services, key economic activities, such as tourism, in northern Tasmania would be severely retarded. What is an already unacceptably high level of unemployment would, therefore, deteriorate even further. Since March 1996 and the period of the stewardship of this government, all services to regional Australia—not just aviation—have been under constant pressure in the name of economic efficiency. Under this government, unfortunately, terms like `economic efficiency' mean one thing only—cuts in services. I noted yesterday on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> a story headed `North misses out on fares'. People have remarked on the parochial nature of the north versus south debate in Tasmania, but in this case it is not an argument based on a parochial interest in the generally under-stood sense.</para></talk.start><para>According to a story in the newspaper, people flying from Melbourne to Launceston would have access to a more expensive dicount fare than people flying from Melbourne to Hobart. For those who are not aware, the flying time from Melbourne to Hobart is around 65 minutes but the flying time from Melbourne to Launceston is about 50 minutes. I understand that that would have been the first occasion that major airline fares to Launceston exceeded those to Hobart. Fortunately, I have been able to ascertain from the newspaper and from other sources that the airlines have now changed their minds. I was talking about both Southern and Ansett-Kendall in respect of that fare structure. So both airlines were at fault in that regard. They have now changed their minds and restructured these fares to ensure that people in northern Tasmania are not disadvantaged—in the sense that they will be paying the same fare—although one can mount an argument that they ought to be paying a lower fare for travelling a significantly shorter distance, given that one would expect that the cost structure of the airlines would be less to travel that shorter distance.</para><para>In coming to aspects of the legislation, I think it is important to note that the second reading amendment we are proposing—which I understand the government is accepting—is designed to ensure, at least in part, that services to regional Australia are not reduced. I will return to this point later. But going to the detail of the bill, schedule 1 relates to a liberalisation of foreign ownership rules for Australian airlines. At the nub of the opposition's support for the bill is a view that Australian companies must be able to compete on the international stage and that competition can enhance the welfare of and services to our community and economy—notwithstanding the glitch that I just referred to. Australian companies can provide that competition and our community can gain the greatest benefit from it, if they are given the latitude to operate under similar conditions to their competitors.</para><para>I must add that this argument applies equally to the Australian shipping industry. The minister, Mr Anderson, has two reports. One of these reports which has been available to the government since 1997 argues for government action to ensure that the Australian shipping fleet is able to compete equally with foreign shipping. But Mr Anderson has refused to act, and this key transport sector is being left to wither and die. But I digress.</para><para>Returning to the bill before us, these amendments seek to remove some of the current restrictions on foreign airlines' ownership and control of Australian international airlines, other than Qantas. At present the Air Navigation Act 1920 limits ownership of shares in an Australian international airline to no more than 25 per cent for an individual foreign airline and no more than 35 per cent in total for all foreign airlines. And I welcome the minister. The amendments remove these restrictions and replace them with a requirement that a foreign person can own no more than 49 per cent of an Australian international airline. This makes that provision more general and removes the distinction between restrictions on airlines and persons. I note for the record that these amendments do not apply to restrictions on the level of foreign ownership of Qantas. Those restrictions are contained in the Qantas Sale Act 1992, and there are no amendments to that act before the Senate. But I would be naïve to infer that these amendments have absolutely no bearing on Qantas. As has been borne out in recent press reports, British Airways has a keen interest in the passage of these amendments. That airline has made no secret of its desire to acquire a larger proportion of Qantas. That decision is not before this house and that debate will occur should amendments to that act be brought forward.</para><para>There has been a lot of focus on the recent negotiations between Air New Zealand and News Corporation in relation to the sale of News Corporation's share in Ansett domestic. This would give Air New Zealand 100 per cent ownership and control of Ansett domestic. As Ansett domestic owns 49 per cent of Ansett International—an Australian international airline for the purposes of the air services agreements—the amendments before the Senate are important for that deal to proceed. Soon after the announcement of that deal, the public became aware of negotiations between Qantas and Air New Zealand, or at least their significant shareholder, Brierleys, and simultaneously new talks between Ansett and Singapore Airlines seeking to finalise long-term ownership arrangements.</para><para> It now appears that the talks between Qantas and Brierleys have been suspended, and there is an expectation that the announced deal between Air New Zealand and Ansett may proceed. The opposition has therefore considered this bill in a broad context. In fact, there are 12 airlines that have at one time or another been designated and have received allocations from the International Air Services Commission. Each of these airlines, with the exception of Qantas—for previously stated reasons—and National Jet Systems—because it is no longer an Australian company—would be beneficiaries under the new provisions of the act. Not all of these airlines are currently operating, but it shows the potential for broader application of what is before us. The limits on foreign ownership and control in the Navigation Act 1920 are derived from the provisions in the bilateral air services arrangements. These provisions allow either signatory to an air services agreement to refuse entry of airlines of the other country into their market on the grounds that they are not substantially owned and effectively controlled by nationals of that country.</para><para>The Productivity Commission inquiry report released in September 1998 provided a focus for considering and reassessing progress with Australia's approach to international air services. When the government announced its response to that report, the opposition welcomed the government's decision to reject the more extreme elements of it. The opposition supported the choice of incremental liberalisation rather than what was proposed, which was a unilateral and unfettered liberalisation favoured by some.</para><para>There is no sense in giving away rights without getting something back in return, in the opposition's view. The changes before the Senate are part of that incremental approach to liberalisation of international air services. They liberalise ownership and investment arrangements whilst staying clearly within the bilateral air services arrangements. They build on the long and strong history of aviation reform by the previous Labor government. The challenge to any government is to maintain the momentum of change while still delivering a benefit to the Australian community and Australian exporters, including tourism interests, air freight users and Australian international airlines.</para><para>So ownership and control provisions are a universal feature of an internationally applied framework of bilateral treaties. An individual country cannot progress too far in isolation. The changes put before us in these amendments will assist in airlines' alliance plans, will allow better access to capital markets and will ensure that Australia retains a healthy presence in the international market. At the same time, it sends a message that Australia is continuing to reform and is not a closed country.</para><para>My colleagues on this side of the chamber share a view that our community is best served by competition, but sensible competition that ensures that we all share in the benefits. That brings me to our second reading amendment with regard to this bill. Should the changes to the foreign ownership provisions in the Air Navigation Act 1920 proceed, it is still up to the government to consider the national interest implications of each application of foreign purchasers of Australian airlines. The government's foreign investment and sectoral guidelines, which are applied through the Foreign Investment Review Board, will also be amended to reflect changes in this bill. Under those sectoral guidelines, the Foreign Investment Review Board can presently only permit approval provided it is consistent with the national interest of acquisition of up to 25 per cent of an Australian domestic or international airline by an individual foreign airline flying to Australia, 40 per cent in aggregate of an Australian domestic airline by foreign airlines and 35 per cent in aggregate of an Australian international airline by foreign airlines.</para><para>Other foreign investors, including foreign airlines who do not fly into Australia, can acquire up to 100 per cent of an Australian domestic airline. Although the government has been prepared to consider proposals in excess of those standards for domestic airlines in special circumstances, there is no similar exception for international carriers. So, to take advantage of changes arising from this bill, the sectoral guidelines will need to be changed. The Foreign Investment Review Board is also, as I said, required to take account of the national interest. So it is in that area that the government, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, has latitude to examine closely the plans and intentions of proposed investments.</para><para>The opposition's amendment relates to the proposed investment by Air New Zealand to take over Ansett. Legitimate and expected concerns exist, held by the employees and their representatives, that the deal will not deliver on the expectations of our community. As I said before, the opposition supports globalisation of markets and opening our organisations to foreign ownership, provided there are benefits and provided those benefits are shared and enhance our community.</para><para>In relation to this proposed deal, there are a number of concerns in the community, and I will enumerate them. There is a concern that Air New Zealand is undercapitalised and that jobs will be cut to provide that injection of funds. The Australian Services Union has a concern that there will be a loss of 2,000 jobs in administration, information technology, engineering and maintenance, and reservations. There is also a concern about a loss of skills and expertise from Australia and that jobs will be transported to purported lower wage markets, particularly in New Zealand. There is a concern that the regional focus of Ansett and its subsidiaries, Kendell, Aeropelican and Skywest, must also be maintained for passenger and trade access to and from regional communities. There is also an issue of just which badged airline—for example, Air New Zealand or Ansett International—will receive what share of future growth in international business. Obviously the fear is that the growth will be through Air New Zealand and that Ansett International will not receive its fair share, with a flow on to jobs and job security.</para><para>I must say that, after a briefing from Ansett and Air New Zealand on this proposed deal, I personally was far from satisfied on a number of points, particularly on the issue of job security. That is why these amendments we have before us are so important. While it has principally been Ansett employees and their union officials who have raised and campaigned around these issues, they are echoes of the fears in the broader community. They are concerns that we are hearing continually: concerns about jobs, the maintenance of skills, job securityfor those who have jobsgrowth for the future and access for members of our community to aviation services.</para><para>In considering the decision on the effective takeover of Ansett by Air New Zealand, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the government must obtain commitments from Air New Zealand to address these concerns. Through this amendment we are calling on the government to pursue assurances from Air New Zealand that ensure the benefits of liberalisation of ownership and the opening of this airline will be shared. We seek to ensure that Ansett remains headquartered in Australia, firstly. This is to be sure that the significant presence of this Australian airline remains in Australia. The message from all is that this airline is important to our community and for jobs, and that this community wants the company to still identify with Australia and to have its main office here, with the jobs that go with it. Those headquarters must be more than just a building. If the new entity fails to honour the commitments it has given to both the government and the opposition, we believe it must be held accountable. The company must therefore have a management presence in Australia such that it can be held accountable. I seek confirmation on that point from the minister. I want to know where we go and whom we go to when and if there is such a problem. </para><para>The second point I want to raise is that a fair share of future growth in Air New Zealand's international routes will be through Ansett International. Again, this is about aspirations for growth and to address the concern that growth will be shared between the airlines in a fair manner for their common owner. The third point I want to raise is that high skill, high value Ansett Airlines jobs remain in Australia. Again, this is about growth and about ensuring opportunities for quality of life for current and future generations. It is about getting a fair share of the benefits of growth, globalisation and competition, not just a share for the shareholders and executives.</para><para>The issue of skill shortages in the aircraft, engineering and maintenance areas has been raised in the media and in the Senate. I have been informed that Qantas is already employing skilled licensed aircraft maintenance engineers from overseas. Australian airlines must address these skill shortages in the interests of the community and the economy. Points (d) and (e) of the amendment go to the retention of jobs and services and to the potential for growth in services in regional and rural communities. These points are about ensuring that regional communities do not pay the price of cheaper airfares on popular routes. </para><para>In conclusion, I would like to say that the opposition will not decline to give this bill a second reading. But, in relation to the announced deal between News Limited and Air New Zealand, we are urging them in the strongest possible terms to exercise the powers they have to ensure, firstly, that Ansett Australia remains headquartered in Australia; secondly, that a fair share of the future growth in Air New Zealand's international routes be through Ansett International; thirdly, that high skill, high value Ansett jobs remain in Australia; fourthly, that Ansett jobs in regional and rural communities not be jeopardised by the sale; and, fifthly, that services to regional and rural communities be preserved at current or higher levels. We ask and, indeed, expect the government to support our second reading amendment. The Democrats have indicated they will support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>13826</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator O'Brien for his quite clinical assessment of the legislation and of the points involved in the government's bill.

I was involved with members of the Youth Roundtable, who have come along to see how the parliament sometimes works. We have been waiting for this bill for several days, and it happened to come on at the very time when I did not want it to—when I was with the young people. Their timetable is very tight.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—It is Murphy's Law.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—As Senator O'Brien said, it is Murphy's Law. The government did announce in a joint statement on international air services in June 1999 that it would, among other things, reform the foreign ownership rules for Australian international airlines other than Qantas. You might recall that the arrangement up to that time was that any single foreign airline could have a 25 per cent interest in Australian flagged international airlines, or any group of foreign carriers could have a 35 per cent interest. But we announced back in June 1999 that we were going to amend that to give Australian flagged international carriers the right to get more capital and to get the expertise that international airlines could provide.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I understand that Senator Greig, in his speech on the second reading, complained that the Senate did not have enough time to consider the bill in full. However, as I said, this policy of the government has been around for more than nine months, and a lot of work has been done with it. I might say to the opposition how gratifying it is that the government and the opposition can work together in the interests of Australia's airline industry. I appreciate the work that Mr Martin Ferguson, the shadow minister in the other chamber, and his staff, have done in conjunction with Mr Anderson and his adviser in coming up with a suitable outcome for this needed legislation. The reason I think everyone supports it, including the Democrats, is that the benefits of international air travel are increasingly important to the Australian community. Tourism is now Australia's largest single export industry, with earnings of some $16.3 billion in 1998-99. Of course, the international tourism industry creates jobs for Australians, and, as I was saying to members of the Youth Roundtable earlier, it is the type of activity that will provide jobs for young Australians, particularly in rural and regional Australia where young Australians are looking for work. </para><para>Tourism in rural and regional Australia is increasing, and I might sound a bit parochial when I keep mentioning Longreach in my state of Queensland. It was a wool community in years gone by, but it has now turned around quite substantially. While the annual income from wool in the Longreach area is about $22 million annually, from tourism it is around $45 million. It just shows how important tourism is to regional and remote Australia; and of course the airline industry brings in foreign tourists to our country.</para><para>International air services also carried some $53 billion worth of freight into Australia in the year ended December 1999. But Australian international airlines do compete in a global market, and to maintain and increase their market share they must be given the opportunity to develop attractive products for consumers, based upon their assessment of commercial demands. They do that either in their own right or in partnership with airlines of other countries.</para><para>The system of bilateral arrangement, where countries that govern international aviation impose national ownership and control restrictions to regulate entry into the international aviation market, does apply. These commonly require that international airlines be substantially owned or effectively controlled by either party to a bilateral agreement. Australia's current ownership control requirements mean that expansion of our international airlines can be assisted only to a limited degree at the present time by drawing upon foreign investment. The current arrangements encourage high levels of debt rather than obtaining equity to fund long-term expansion. In a cyclical industry like the international airline industry, this is not a very desirable method of funding expansion.</para><para>As Senator O'Brien said, this bill, if enacted, will amend the ownership and control requirements to provide for up to 49 per cent foreign ownership of Australian international carriers, other than Qantas—and I emphasise that Qantas is dealt with separately in other acts—with no distinction between foreign airlines and other foreign investors. This will set the level of foreign equity in Australian airlines at the limit that our bilateral partners are likely to accept. The amendments to the Air Navigation Act proposed in this bill do not apply to Qantas. The arrangements for Qantas are legislated for in the Qantas Sale Act. This amendment bill also contains a provision relating to the Sydney Airport Curfew Act, and there are some amendments to that. They have been debated here by other senators, and they are fairly sensible amendments that all parties to this bill actually support.</para><para>I emphasise that, whilst understandably the discussion in the Senate today has been about Ansett and Air New Zealand, and Air New Zealand's buying out of News Limited's share in Ansett, this bill does not relate only to Ansett. It relates to any airline that has a majority Australian ownership and which flies and is licensed to fly internationally. These liberalised foreign ownership restrictions—the 49 per cent—will benefit every Australian company that seeks in the future to operate international air services. I also emphasise to the Senate and to those who may have an interest in this bill that the bill does not represent government approval for the Air New Zealand takeover of Ansett. The government is considering that bid through a parallel process under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. As Senator Mackay and Senator O'Brien have said, the opposition has a second reading amendment to the bill, and I can confirm that we will be supporting that amendment. We are considering the headquarters issue and the future of Ansett International, and we are of course considering the regional implications of the bid.</para><para>I understand that Senator Greig has foreshadowed a Democrat amendment. We will not be supporting the amendment because we do not think it is necessary—in fact, we think it is redundant. We will be considering all of the issues set out in the amendment proposed by the Democrats as we work through the proposed takeover. I want to emphasise to the Senate that we are examining the proposal very closely and very rigorously, and Ansett and Air New Zealand cannot take the government's approval for granted. Mr Anderson and the government agencies that support him in these considerations will be very closely looking at the Air New Zealand takeover.</para><para>In addition to our own considerable in-house capabilities, we have commissioned outside financial advisers to provide us with additional advice about the financial sustainability of that proposal. I suppose it could be argued that the amendment is necessary because some future government might not follow the same rigorous approach that this government has adopted; however, I cannot imagine any government, current or future, that would not consider the points set out in the Democrats' amendment as a matter of course. We believe that the Democrats' amendment would simply clutter up the Air Navigation Act with an unnecessary statement of what is obvious. I also suggest that, even if we were inclined to support what the Democrats are saying in a legislative way, we would not be supporting it under the Air Navigation Act. It would seem that the place for a debate on these sorts of matters would be when parliament is considering any amendments to the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act, which is the more appropriate place for the types of amendments that the Democrats are proposing.</para><para>I understand that Senator Mackay in her address sought an explanation as to the disparity between the fine for breaches at Kingsford Smith Airport in Sydney—which are a maximum of $550,000 under this bill—and the maximum fine that applies in Adelaide, which is $110,000. The current maximum fine for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is $110,000. In response to Senator Mackay, I indicate that the government have identified that there is a particular enforcement problem at Sydney airport. Without overstating the obvious, it sometimes became a paying proposition for an international airline to deliberately breach the curfew, knowing that even if the maximum fine of $110,000 were imposed, they would still be better off. The consequences sometimes of missing a flight, all of those things like not being able to take off at the right time, having to put up passengers in a hotel—and in a big aircraft there are a lot of passengers—and rescheduling can become a very expensive exercise for the airline involved. Some of them may have thought at times that they would be better off to pay the fine and to send the aircraft out in the curfew time rather than to abide by the curfew. That is the reason why we have increased the maximum fine applicable at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport.</para><para>Senator Mackay questioned why this did not apply to Adelaide. The answer to that, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, is that your state of Adelaide is not quite Sydney and Adelaide Airport is certainly not Kingsford Smith Airport, and we expect that there will not be the same sort of incentive to breach the curfew at the Adelaide Airport as there is, for the reasons I have mentioned, at Sydney airport. There have been a number of breaches at Sydney airport. There has recently been a successful prosecution. I am unaware of any breach of curfew at Adelaide airport. If there have been any, the problem is not very great. Accordingly, the fine has been set at the lower level. But if it becomes obvious—if history shows—that there is an increase in the breaches of the curfew at Adelaide airport, then the government will not hesitate to increase the penalties to bring them into a higher category. But, to this date, there has not been any factual evidence which has necessitated the government looking at that. That is why the difference has occurred.</para><para>I thank those senators who have participated in the debate and commend to the chamber the bill and the second reading amendment that has been moved by Senator Mackay on behalf of the opposition. </para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>13828</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>13828</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrat amendment No. 1:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 5), after item 12, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">12A After section 11A</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">11AA Decisions in relation to foreign shareholdings</inline></para><para>In making any decision required to be made under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 in relation to the acquisition of a shareholding to which section 11A applies, the Treasurer must be satisfied that the acquisition will not result in any of the following goals not being substantially met:</para><para>(a) the goal that the headquarters of an Australian airline should remain in Australia;</para><para>(b) the goal that highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry should remain in Australia;</para><para>(c) the goal that jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised;</para><para>(d) the goal that services to rural and regional communities should be maintained and, if possible, improved.</para></quote><para>As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, this amendment calls on the Treasurer, when making a decision as to whether the national interest is served by permitting a transaction to proceed, to be satisfied that the acquisition will result in a number of goals being met.

I have been written to—as, I am sure, the government and opposition have—by the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, amongst others, and their correspondence said in part:</para><quote><para>Unlike News Corporation, which had a significant national presence within all regions of Australia, Air New Zealand has no domestic presence in, or demonstrable concern for, rural Australia. Decisions to rationalise services and withdraw from uneconomic routes affecting both the level of service provided and the ongoing employment of local people within the community would not have to be counterweighed against public sentiment, media comment and political response.</para></quote><para>What I would like to make clear is that I am not suggesting that the Air New Zealand purchase of Ansett will result in a reduction in services to regional Australia, nor am I saying that the transaction or any other airline acquisition will result in a massive loss of skills to foreign countries. What I am saying is that when the Treasurer is reviewing these sorts of transactions he needs to have at the forefront of his mind the goals I have outlined, and those goals should be expressly set out in the legislation.</para><para>We have just passed a second reading amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. As I indicated during my speech in the second reading debate, I have been advised that the Labor Party will be opposing this Democrat amendment. That does perplex me a little, and I would like to compare my amendment to the second reading amendment just passed. The Labor Party's second reading amendment expressed that, in examining the proposed sale, the government should consider, firstly, that Ansett Australia should remain headquartered in Australia. My amendment also provides that the headquarters of an Australian airline should remain in Australia. The second reading amendment states that `a fair share of future growth in routes should be through Ansett International.' That is an Ansett specific issue. My amendment does not deal with that because my amendment applies across any transaction involving the purchases of an Australian airline. The second reading amendment also states that `high skilled, high value Ansett airlines jobs should remain in Australia.' My amendment also provides that highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry should remain in Australia. The second reading amendment states that `jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised by the sale,' and my amendment also provides that jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised. The second reading amendment states that `services to regional and rural communities should be preserved at current levels, or improved. My amendment provides that services to rural and regional communities should be maintained and, if possible, improved. So you can see very clearly the similarities. </para><para>My probably rhetorical question to both the senator representing the minister and to the opposition spokesperson on aviation, Senator Mackay, is this: could you please explain to me—and to the aviation industry presumably—why you cannot and will not support this amendment, given that you have just supported a motion which has almost identical terms? The second reading motion that we have passed today is all well and good as it relates to the Air New Zealand Ansett acquisition but it only relates to that transaction. Senator Mackay, with respect, I ask: what happens when the next foreign acquisition of an Australian airline happens? There will be no motion before the chamber which you will be able to amend, as you have done on this occasion. I worry that perhaps the Labor Party's professed commitment to rural and regional Australia and to the aviation industry on this issue is more cursory than sincere.</para><para>Senator Macdonald, you stated in your address, in your second reading speech, that the amendment I am proposing here really ought to have been done under a different act. I did speak to that in my speech in the second reading debate and I did acknowledge that. Yes, it would be better dealt with there but the fact is we do not have that opportunity before us now and I am simply seeking the opportunity to secure that here. Minister, you also said that you see this Democrat amendment as being largely redundant, unnecessary as it were. I disagree with you, but if that is the case then just support it. If it is redundant, okay, fine—support it, we move on and it does not matter. The fact that you will not support it and yet you argue that it is redundant suggests to me that your argument is not very solid. So my plea at this late stage—and I understand that the government and opposition still oppose this amendment—is that this amendment is, I believe, a better and stronger one in terms of what we are trying to achieve here because, quite simply, a second reading amendment, as government and opposition senators know, simply does not have the imprimatur or the legal standing that a proper amendment does. I think this is a more sincere and comprehensive amendment and I seek in committee support for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13830</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, I intend to respond to Senator Greig in relation to his amendment but the first thing I want to do is remind the minister that, in my speech in the second reading debate, I referred to the commitments that have been given by Air New Zealand that the headquarters of Ansett will remain in Australia and that there is a variety of other commitments that have been given by Air New Zealand. I suppose in part I would be dealing with Senator Greig's amendment in saying this, but what I said was that the headquarters for the airline needed to be more than just a building and that, if the new entity failed to honour its commitments, then it had to be held accountable. I wanted to know where we would go if the new airline did not maintain that commitment and if it established its headquarters outside of Australia, so perhaps you might deal with that.</para></talk.start><para>Let me deal with Senator Greig's amendment and say that the opposition will not be supporting the amendment. The proposed amendment makes a major change to the Air Navigation Act 1920 that will impact on other significant legislation, in particular the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. The opposition have been involved in discussions on this issue for some time and we regard this in some ways as a me-too option—and certainly as a last-minute option which seeks to impose the name of the Democrats on the debate at a very late stage—because, frankly, the Democrats were absent from any discussions and proposed no ideas when options for addressing these concerns were being resolved earlier.</para><para>The proposed amendment, which we saw yesterday, would in many respects be legislating with haste and with consequences that, I would suggest, would not be clear were we to pass the amendment. In the opposition's view, the amendment would do nothing more to assist the concerns of the community and Ansett staff than those that have been encapsulated in the agreement with the government, which are represented at least in part by the second reading amendment to the bill which has been carried, given particularly that that amendment had the support of the government as well as the opposition. Our second reading motion considered all the goals that are described in the Democrat amendment and more, as I think was just conceded by Senator Greig. Labor's second reading motion dealt with the issue of Ansett International receiving a fair share of the growth in business of the whole airline and, through the Labor second reading amendment, we have given these issues the profile they deserve for the government's deliberations through the Foreign Investment Review Board process.</para><para>Legislation relating to foreign ownership and arrangements of this type is not for last-minute agreement and policy-making. Indeed, the government is on notice that the community is watching on all the fronts referred to in our second reading amendment, such as Australian headquartering, retention of skills in Australia, Australia receiving a fair share of the growth in the business, retention of rural and regional jobs, and retention and improvement of services in regional Australia. We do not think the Democrat amendment will add anything in practice to the deal, which if it is not the impetus for the bill is certainly substantially affected by the amendments to the bill. If you go to the amendments themselves, remember that in the amendments we are talking about changes to law and expecting that at some stage, if there is a dispute, some court will be asked to interpret them and to give them a meaning. Take where it says for example: </para><quote><para>... the Treasurer must be satisfied that the acquisition will not result in any of the following goals not being substantially met:</para></quote><para>The question that I posed to the minister about the substance of compliance and, for example, Air New Zealand having its headquarters in Australia would not be dealt with, in our view, by the words in (a):</para><quote><para>(a) the goal that the headquarters of an Australian airline should remain in Australia ...</para></quote><para>That could be a building and a skeleton operation. There is substantial room for argument in terms of those words. It goes on:</para><quote><para>(b) the goal that highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry should remain in Australia ...</para></quote><para>How many? Where? The amendment is not adequate in terms of what I think the Democrats are seeking to achieve. With due respect, the Democrats have put something together quickly and have piggybacked on our second reading amendment, thinking that it was probably better that it be in the bill. We do not think so. We think that the inclusion of these words adds little. I could go on—(c) and (d) are equally vague about the requirements on, say, a prospective joint venture partner in an Australian operation. </para><para>Given that the government has substantial control of the process, it is a matter for government—and we expect to be in government in a very short period of time—to implement the desires of the community. The government retains control over that through the legislation that will be in place following the passage of this bill, without this amendment. Were Senator Greig able to demonstrate that that was not the case—and I am sure that he cannot—then we might have concerns. But, looking at the amendment, reading it and trying to understand how it would be interpreted, the reality is that it is so broad and vague that—as I think Senator Greig and others know—the legal profession would drive a phalanx of big trucks through it. Forgive me, Senator Greig, but the opposition think that your amendment is well intentioned but is, firstly, unnecessary and, secondly, inadequate in achieving the aim that you require. It is a matter for the deliberations of the executive as to how they implement this matter, and it is better done that way than in some legalistic way. Indeed, any government which did not have regard to the issues contained in the second reading amendment—and indeed in your amendment—would risk the opprobrium of the Australian people. The opposition will not be supporting this amendment, and we continue to support the bill unamended.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>13831</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Greig has proposed his amendment, and I confirm that we will be opposing it for the reasons that I mentioned when concluding the second reading debate. Even if we were inclined to support it, it is in the wrong bill anyhow. Whilst I have not looked at the constitutional questions and I am not as familiar with the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act as I expect I should be—as, no doubt, all other senators are—it would seem to me that imposing these sorts of obligations on the Treasury in considering matters under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act through an amendment to this bill, an aviation legislation bill, would not be appropriate. </para></talk.start><para>I can only repeat to Senator Greig that the substantive parts of his amendment are, as he rightly points out, very similar to the second reading amendment, but they are the sorts of goals that any government, regardless of its complexion, would obviously take into account. Naturally enough, we as a government would hope—and any government would hope—that the headquarters of an Australian airline would remain in Australia. Obviously, any Australian government would also want highly skilled, high value jobs associated with the aviation industry to remain in Australia. It is, after all, an Australian airline. It is an Australian government looking after Australian interests. Why conceivably would any government—this government or a future government—do otherwise? The amendments include:</para><quote><para>(c) The goal that jobs in rural and regional Australia should not be jeopardised;</para><para>(d) The goal that services to rural and regional communities should be maintained and, if possible, improved.</para></quote><para>Senator Greig hits a soft spot with me on those areas as I am a major user of regional airlines, and I continue to have my say to the companies concerned about the services they provide, their frequency, their continuity and the type of aircraft that they use. I would say, Senator, that those things are a given. As I said in my second reading speech, we are not really inclined to clutter a piece of legislation with amendments that really do not mean anything, that are not appropriate to this act in any case and that would just add verbiage to the legislation, making it more complicated for anyone to read.</para><para>In answering Senator O'Brien, can I go on to say that the amendment moved by the Labor Party has been supported—perhaps I could almost say enthusiastically supported—by the government. I think that gives an indication to anyone who might be using the provisions of this act at any time in the future of what this government and—on the basis that any alternative government would only be a Labor Party government—any Labor government would do in considering these matters.</para><para>The opposition's second reading amendment clearly indicates the government's view. It is fairly obvious that those issues will be taken into account very carefully and appropriately by the Treasurer in assessing the application under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. I do not think we can pervert the course of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act and the decisions that the Treasurer will have to make under that act by being any more prescriptive, but the intention of the government is clear. If it is an Australian airline, that airline obviously will have to deal with the government for a long time in the future. I am quite confident that the Australian international airlines will work cooperatively with Australian governments, of whatever persuasion, in the interests of the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>13832</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will reply briefly to some of the feedback I have received from the government and the opposition. Firstly, if I can address some of the comments that Senator O'Brien made, there was much wonderful hyperbole about how allegedly terrific the Labor Party amendment is—it is in sentiment, but it is not in practice. While the ALP amendment largely seeks to do all those things which the Democrat amendment does, the fact remains that, as a second reading amendment, the Labor Party's motion has absolutely no legislative impact—nil—as opposed to the Democrats' amendment, which would have legislative impact. So you are either really serious about addressing these issues or you are not. I also make the point, which seems to have been overlooked by opposition members, that the opposition amendment, now passed, relates only to the Ansett deal. It makes no reference to or provision for potential future deals. So there is a flaw there. </para></talk.start><para>In reply to what appears to be the major criticism from the minister with regard to my amendment that it is untidy effectively, that it clutters and that what we need is simplicity, that strikes me as odd.

I also make the point that, contrary to your claim, Minister, I am very confident that there are no constitutional questions in relation to whether this amendment ought to be applied here or to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act. Quite simply, if my amendment were to be out of order, then I would be ruled so by the chair and there is no indication of that. On that basis, I summarise by arguing strongly and rightly that this is the better amendment, it is the more sincere amendment. If you are genuinely concerned about Ansett headquarters, if you are genuinely concerned about services to rural and regional areas, if you are genuinely concerned about Australian jobs, then legislate so, do not simply indicate so. Labor's amendment is simply indicative, not prescriptive. In summary, I remain committed to what, fundamentally, is the best amendment in this regard. It is certainly more comprehensive in its potential application and I seek the support of the committee for it.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>13833</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot resist responding briefly. Senator Greig's comments are equal to a red rag to a bull. Let me ask Senator Greig whether he can tell us how his amendment would require a particular proportion of skilled jobs to remain in Australia. Frankly, it does not. Let me ask Senator Greig how his amendment would require headquarters to remain in Australia. Frankly, it does not. As I said earlier, for a company seeking to participate in Australia, it is a much stronger position to negotiate and give undertakings to the government about its ongoing intentions than to have a single-barrier test applied, which is what your measures would be because they are aims. Once in, once the takeover has taken place, the amendment you propose would have no effect. That is the problem with trying to legislate on the run in this area. Were you to be successful in your desire, as I take it from your amendments, you would have to be proposing a much more prescriptive provision requiring ongoing actions by the company seeking to take over. The reality is that, with the support of the government, our amendment has obtained a public commitment to seeking those undertakings as a prerequisite to the takeover. The honour of the company taking over in this case will be tested if they breach those undertakings. </para></talk.start><para>To achieve the alternative which you seek, which I think is something more than the undertaking that we are going to get in this and, I suspect, in every other case that is a takeover—and it cannot be Qantas, as I established in my speech in the second reading debate because it does not apply to Qantas, so we are talking about Kendell, Impulse or Aeropelican, or something like that, which are subsidiaries of Ansett and already taken over, or we are talking about Southern Airlines which are subsidiaries of Qantas; I am not sure where we are headed, but something will arise in the future and I am sure that the parliament has legislative powers for the future as well—the opposition believes it has come up with measures which, in effect, I think your amendment says are required. What we are saying is that you cannot throw an amendment of this nature on the table and think you are going to achieve that because you will be establishing not an arrangement which requires a relationship with the government of the day and governments for the future, but a simple one-barrier test which can be processed through the courts and, once passed, the matter is at an end. That is one of the fatal flaws in your amendment. The reality is, frankly, that your amendment is `me too' and you are seeking now to say, `We're doing better because we want to put this in the bill.' I am suggesting to you that you will be achieving a lesser outcome by putting this into the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>13833</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just quickly in reply, I cannot agree.

Other senators from the opposition will address some of the broader economic issues and other issues in the bills. I do not profess to be expert in those areas, and I think Senator Sherry and others will address some of those areas. I have taken an interest in this particular measure and its impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector, mainly because of my shadow ministry responsibilities and also because of the inquiry into the goods and services tax conducted by the community affairs committee last year when a range of these issues were raised constantly with us and when, to be brutally frank, a lot of organisations said that the impact of the FBT changes would be more serious for them than any of the GST changes because much of the not-for-profit area was largely GST free and the FBT changes were going to have a very serous effect on their ability to provide services.</para></talk.start><para>I move a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition: </para><quote><para>Omit the words after “That”, substitute:</para><para>“further consideration of the bills be an order of the day for the day after the day on which a report is tabled in the Senate of an independent inquiry established by the Government, after consulting the not-for-profit sector on membership and terms of reference, to:</para><para>	(a) investigate and update the definitions of `public benevolent institution' and `charitable institution' for the purposes of tax law; and</para><para>	(b) inquire into the appropriate taxation treatment of charitable and not-for-profit organisations and the public hospital sector”.</para></quote><para>In moving this amendment, Labor are seeking to ensure that the debate about this bill is an informed debate. I will come back to this theme later in my speech, but we are seeking to make sure that the decisions we make on the taxation treatment of the charitable and not-for-profit sector are informed decisions. Our main thesis is that we are not in the position to do that at the moment and that we do not have enough information about the impact of these changes. I think the GST community affairs committee inquiry threw a lot of light on some of those problems, but we still have not come to terms with the serious impact these changes may have on the not-for-profit sector and particularly on the services they deliver to the most disadvantaged in the community—the disabled, the poor, the aged and the Aboriginal medical sector.</para><para>These are very serious issues. Our major concern is that we do not have enough good information about the impact on those organisations and that we should not be making massive changes to their taxation treatment without that information. It is the case that Labor had supported a position prior to the last election very similar to the government's which sought to cap fringe benefits tax arrangements. We still support the need for capping, the need for transparency and the need for accountability in terms of these provisions. I do not think that there is anybody in this chamber who has an alternative view. We are arguing about the level of the cap, how it is applied and who it is applied to. I want to make it very clear that the Labor Party do support the cap. We are most dissatisfied with the current arrangements whereby informal advice from the tax office is provided to organisations. They have been basically advised that 30 per cent salary packaging is acceptable and that, provided they do not go over that limit, the tax office will not call on them or ask them to assist them with their inquiries. So it has become a bit of a benchmark in the industry. That is not a very satisfactory way of doing it, and we support the view of the government that we need to regulate that and that we need to find a much better and more transparent way of dealing with this issue.</para><para>Before I continue, I just want to say that, in terms of the second reading amendment, we are obviously looking to defer consideration of these FBT changes for not-for-profit organisations and charitable institutions. That is the impact of our amendment. We are not proposing to delay the rest of the bill and clearly we are suggesting by this measure that, if we are successful with the amendment and the government wants to continue proceeding with the rest of the bill, we will be happy to facilitate that. I understand that there are other measures in the bill about grossing up the formula for fringe benefits that are not the subject of the concern I am expressing now, and we would anticipate those going ahead. But we are concerned to deal with the issues of the impact of the FBT on the not-for-profit sector that I have just raised.</para><para>It is important that we get some certainty into this issue, because there are people currently working in not-for-profit, public hospital and charitable institutions who are unclear as to what their current conditions of employment are. Because of the government's announcement of 1 April as the operative date, people actually do not know what their current conditions of employment are. Most employers have been slow to make changes because they know that the bill has not been passed. They know there is a live debate in the parliament about the conditions that ought to be applied to the not-for-profit sector. There are people who operate under awards, under agreements and in unregulated employment conditions who have a set of employment arrangements that have been thrown up in the air. They do not know how they stand. Like other senators, my office has been getting lots of calls from people saying, `What does this mean for us? How do I arrange our affairs? Have I effectively just had a salary reduction?' and we cannot answer those questions. It is important that we get some certainty to it, that we get something that allows people to operate with a degree of certainty and allows them to plan. I am sure the government says, `Well, if we can just pass the legislation, everything will be certain,' and in a sense that is right. But there are issues we think need to be debated and resolved, and we do not think the government's approach is necessarily the correct one.</para><para>The issue was the subject of submissions to the Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the government's tax package which reported to the Senate in March last year. However, at the time the government signalled that it was unable to comprehensively examine the impact of the proposed FBT changes. In October last year, Labor called for an independent inquiry into this issue. We gave the government notice that we were concerned about the evidence arising from those inquiries, that we were concerned about the evidence being put forward by the charitable and not-for-profit sector, and that we thought an independent inquiry into this issue was warranted. The government has ignored that request. While the government may want to claim that it is a bit late to be moving this amendment, the reality is that we have had a consistent position calling for some sort of inquiry to resolve some of these important public policy issues at stake here and get some clarity as to some of the issues that are causing confusion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—For many months.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—Yes.

As a result of this legislation being put off and the government not responding to that request, we are now in the situation where the operative date has passed, we have not got legislation in place and we have not had a resolution of those public policy issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In my amendment today, I try and throw the issue back to the government in the sense of them consulting with the sector about having an independent inquiry. I also have a motion on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> about a Senate committee inquiry. Being frank and to be fair to the senators on the committee, including me, it is a second-best option. I do not think we have the same level of expertise and resources that an independent inquiry could bring to the issue. We would do a professional and reasonable job, but I think that a Ralph style inquiry would be a better and more comprehensive option and one which would take those great public policy issues a bit further. If this approach is rejected by the government, then we will pursue the Senate inquiry approach. That issue has been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for some time. At the request of the Democrats, I have delayed it as we have tried to find a way through these issues. As I say, I think the independent inquiry would be the better option given the scale of the changes proposed, the number of organisations affected and the impact on the public hospital sector, which is going to be enormous. I think we are talking about $700 million over the next four years, so these are major changes to the taxation treatment. They need a proper examination.</para><para>I accept that the government has now made some changes and the bill currently before the Senate includes a higher limit of $25,000 for the cap for charitable and not-for-profit organisations. The fact that the government has increased the FBT concession limit to charitable and nonprofit organisations is an admission, I think, that the original limit was too low and would have unfairly reduced their ability to deliver services to the disadvantaged. The government has begun to recognise that problem and what it means for services to the most disadvantaged in our community. I am not clear why the government chose the $25,000 limit and how that new higher limit will avoid cuts to services, but it is a sign that the government is trying to deal with the issue. The reality is that even with a higher limit the proposed change will still raise significant amounts of revenue, which means significant cuts to the operational budgets of charitable and nonprofit organisations. An enormous impact is still going to be felt by these organisations.</para><para>The proposed limit on FBT concessions is a significant change to the taxation treatment of charitable and nonprofit organisations and the public hospitals. Yet the only thing we know for certain about this change is that it will act to reduce the range of community and public hospital services they provide. At the time of the Senate inquiry last year, the government was unable to provide any detailed information on the modelling of the impact of the measure. This lack of information was noted in the inquiry's report to the Senate. More than a year after the proposed limits were announced, the government still refuses to or is unable to provide specific information on the impact of the proposed changes. We have no information on the extent of the use of the FBT concessions. We have no information on the pattern of the use of the FBT concessions and we have no information on the value of the FBT concessions to the charitable and nonprofit organisations and public hospitals. The figures on the revenues raised by the proposed FBT limits included in the bill are rough estimates at best. On the government's own figures, I have seen a number of different figures quoted. But they all indicate that over $700 million will be cut from the budgets of charitable and nonprofit organisations and public hospitals over the next four years.</para><para>While the government has been unable to provide detailed information on the impact of the changes it is proposing, the organisations that will be affected have done so. They presented submissions to last year's Senate inquiry and they have continued to lobby and provide evidence of the very real impact on the services they provide. Just a few of the organisations that presented evidence to the Senate inquiry included: the Spastic Centre of New South Wales, which would be forced to cut services to 370 school aged children, close a respite centre and cease services to 200 families in rural communities; Deafness Forum Australia, which would be forced to cut one in three staff; and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, which has stated that all remote health services in the Northern Territory would be closed and many urban services would suffer cuts. These are very real impacts. They are impacts this parliament has to grapple with seriously. We need to come to terms with it. The Labor view is that we ought not make changes when we do not know the impact of those changes and we ought not make changes that we have been warned will seriously affect those in the community who can least protect themselves. I am sure that is a concern for all senators on all sides of the chamber.</para><para>The government has also refused to address the need for compensation to ensure that essential services to the disadvantaged are not reduced as a result of the proposed changes. Clearly, that is an alternative we could consider. It is worth remembering that the issue was examined by the 1995 Industry Commission report into charities. I note that Senator Woodley and I both spoke on it on that occasion. We are still involved in the issue. At the time the commission stated:</para><quote><para>Given the major benefits which [charitable and non-profit organisations] as a whole currently derive from input tax exemptions, however, the Commission considers that any proposal to remove these benefits should include alternative ways of providing the same aggregate level of government assistance to the sector.</para></quote><para>That principle was applied at a time when this was a very small issue compared with what it is today. The growth in fringe benefits tax exemption usage has been phenomenal since then, driven, in part, by a couple of state governments and by the demands placed on the charitable and not-for-profit sector for more services in difficult times. Until there is an independent inquiry into the use of the FBT concessions, we cannot know what the impact of the proposed limits are and we cannot know what reductions to services will occur as a result. We therefore cannot be sure that we can protect those services to the least disadvantaged in our community. In the short time left to me, I want to mention that there is a real need to look at the basis of many of these concessions. There is a lot of concern about the definition of `PBI' and the definition of `charities'. As I understand it, we have to refer back to an act of the British parliament from the 16th century. It is a funny way to build a new tax system for the 21st century, and it seems to me that we can do better.</para><para>I turn briefly to the role of the Democrats. I have had some very constructive discussions with them and I hope we can continue to work our way through these issues. What we are proposing is that the inquiry precede debate on this bill, that we have the information at our fingertips when we debate the bill. I urge the Democrats to adopt that approach. I am concerned that they may be looking at adopting an approach of voting for some sort of inquiry but will deal with the bill now. We do not have the information that allows us to have an intelligent public policy debate about the legislation. We are not informed by that inquiry. If we make the decision and have the inquiry afterwards, it raises the question: why have an inquiry? I know that the Democrats, like the Labor Party, are interested in a broader inquiry than—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—Senator, it is always nice to know what the results of an inquiry are before you institute one. I am sure it is a policy you pursue, and Telstra does come to mind. But I digress. I make the point to the Democrats that, while I know there are wider issues, at the heart of this is the FBT and its impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector. There is also the question of the GST. I understand the sensitivities about that. If we are serious about having a proper public policy debate about how all those taxes impact on the sector and its ability to deliver services, we have to do it in a holistic way. We need to have the inquiry and then make decisions about the taxation treatment of those institutions. If we do not have the inquiry first, we will be making these decisions tomorrow morning without the benefit of that information. I think it would be a very brave senator who made the claim that we really know what the impacts of these changes are. I do not think the government knows and I do not think the Senate knows either. I would make a plea to the Democrats to support our second reading amendment because it does allow us to have that proper and informed public policy debate, to have a Ralph type inquiry report to inform the Senate's work and to inform proper legislation in this country. We would get a much better result from such an approach.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Clearly, the Labor Party operates in a political environment where it does not have the numbers. If the amendment is defeated and the bill goes to the committee stage, we will vote on any amendments proposed and we will have to take a stand on each of the issues. We would prefer to do that with the benefit of a proper inquiry, proper modelling and proper research. We think we would get a much better public policy outcome if we dealt with it in that way. A proper inquiry would inform the Senate debate, allow us to make informed decisions and allow us to have a bit of a community debate too about the proper taxation treatment of charities before we moved to deal with the FBT limits. There are, of course, questions about the operative date and so on, but our preferred position, since October, has been to have that proper inquiry, to recognise the evidence we received from the GST inquiry that there were serious problems with the implementation of these FBT proposals—to have an inquiry to get that information—to have an informed debate and then to deal with the bill. That is our preferred option. I hope we get some support for it. If not, obviously we will move on to dealing with the substance of the bill and making decisions accordingly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13838</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, I wish to address the concerns that Senator Evans has just expressed. Certainly, in intention, the Australian Democrats will support the opposition's second reading amendment. It may be that we will still want to change some of the words. We can do that by negotiation tomorrow because obviously the second reading debate of the <inline ref="R1008">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000</inline> will not be finished tonight and will continue for some time tomorrow.

Senator Evans, we will find that out when we have that conversation with you. I just give you that assurance.</para></talk.start><para>I agree with just about everything you have said, in particular that we do not have the kind of information we really need in order to do justice to this debate, and certainly in order to do justice to the charity, churches and not-for-profit sector. The very fact that I have had to use an extended description points to the problem that we have in law. The basis upon which most of these matters are dealt with is a law that goes back some 400 years in English law. Someone told me today that, in fact, it goes back further than that—to the 1100s. I do not know how we can ever expect in a modern society to be basing legislation on that kind of proposition. So we need the kind of inquiry Senator Evans described. I hope that with goodwill on all sides, and maybe a further discussion about wording, we will achieve what Senator Evans has described.</para><para>In the few minutes that are left to me tonight, I want to talk about the motivation for the government introducing this legislation, because the motivation that has led to the debate and the legislation which we have before us is very clear. I would remind the Senate—and I do not know whether senators have forgotten this—that it was the Ralph report on business taxation which proposed that, in order to pay for a reduction in the company tax rate, the government should abolish the fringe benefit tax exemption to this sector. That was a proposal in the Ralph report. Quite clearly, the government were not game to do that. The roof would have fallen in, I am sure, and they realised that. But they did propose a kind of half-way measure, that is, there should be a $17,000 cap across the board on charities, on churches, on hospitals—you name it, wherever there was an exemption in the past, then a $17,000 cap should be imposed in the future. That of course was intended to raise over $200 million, which in effect would achieve what the Ralph report proposed, that is, to compensate for the loss of revenue in lowering the company tax rate.</para><para>The churches and the charities reacted very strongly to that, and for good reason. They know that the Industry Commission—or Productivity Commission as we now call it—some years ago did a major inquiry into charities. In fact, the report they produced was quite thick. It showed that some of the charities and some of the services which they provided were overusing the fringe benefits tax exemption, to such an extent in a few cases that I think one could use the word `rorting' without being unfair. That was true. When that Productivity Commission report came down, the major churches and the major charities realised that there had been some overuse of the fringe benefits tax exemption. So they went and had extensive conversations with the Australian Taxation Office. It was never put in writing, and so the Treasurer keeps on reminding us that there is no legislation and no written advice to actually underline the position I am putting—but it was very clear. I have spoken to charities across the country and all of them have reported that this is what happened: they had a conversation with the tax office; it was not written down; it was not put into legislation. That is true, but all of the charities and churches, et cetera, adopted voluntarily a 30 per cent cap on salary packaging using the fringe benefits tax exemption. That was the agreement reached. The government has totally ignored that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>13839</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>13839</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grieg</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the provisions of the Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 8 May 2000, with particular reference to:</para><para>(a)	the capacity of Australian courts of law to enforce Australian obligations under international human rights treaties;</para><para>(b)	the obligations that such treaties impose to require domestic remedies;</para><para>(c)	the capacity for individuals to access international human rights bodies, the circumstances of that access and the conditions which must be met under the various treaties and instruments, such as the First Optional Protocol, before individuals may access them;</para><para>(d)	the capacity of Australian courts of law to sanction Australian companies for their misconduct in environmental, human rights and industrial activities which may occur overseas but which, if conducted in Australia, would be contrary to Australian law; and</para><para>(e)	suggested amendments to implement Australia's international extraterritorial human rights, environmental or industrial jurisdiction.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13839</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Nick (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Sherry)</inline>—It being 6.50 p.m., the Senate  will move to the consideration of government documents.</para></talk.start></interjection><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979: Report of Attorney-General's Department</title><page.no>13840</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13840</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This is a document that the Attorney-General must have prepared each year to fulfil his obligations under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The report from the Attorney-General and the act that he is in compliance with are often thought of as giving permission to policing authorities to intercept telephones, telegrams and no doubt other communications. I see Senator Alston in the chamber. The onset of technology in this area is incredible. The policing authorities find it very useful to listen in to these conversations and, indeed, to tape them in the course of gaining intelligence and evidence for prosecutions. The act allows all that.</para><para>Fundamentally, the act is about protecting our privacy. I think it is very useful to talk to a report like this to bring to our mind that the concept of privacy still has currency, that there is some protection for privacy in the legislation that comes before this chamber and that ultimately becomes law in this country. The issue of privacy is a big one. It is a big issue in Europe and elsewhere. We have laws regulating privacy for the public sector but there are no laws that protect privacy in the private sector. I know that the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, was intent on getting such legislation through when he first took over the office, and no doubt he is still intent on that happening. It would be good to see legislation brought in to protect privacy. We all want our privacy but, unfortunately, moves are not made that would enable us to have it to the extent that we would want. Indeed, the protection is so feeble that maybe it is not the protection of privacy we want but legislation that says there ought to be an equality of possession of information so that, if we are not going to have privacy, at least we will have as much information about things as everybody else does, because knowledge and what you know about others, of course, is a great strength in any relationship one might have.</para><para>Since this act was brought in, the number of authorities that have been able to tap into electronic communications between people has grown. On 28 October 1988 the Victorian police were given possession of it. I must say that is a very significant date because it is the birthday of my wife, Lillian, but that is just an aside that I put in as I go through, Mr Acting Deputy President. The New South Wales Crime Commission was given the power on 30 January 1989, and so on. And I notice that the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission got permission to use these powers on 14 July 1998. There is always a legitimate reason for giving powers to authorities, but there is always a danger that the very purpose of the act—that is, to protect our privacy—becomes damaged because of this. If you look at the number of taps that are allowed, they do not seem greatly excessive. But I think it is always wise for somebody to step up on an occasion like this simply to say, `Yes, the Attorney-General has to have this report prepared and it is proper for us to look at it.' It is proper for us to remember that, really, it is about protecting privacy and that, as the growth of these powers increases, it is always timely for somebody to at least mention that the matters put out by the Attorney-General are being taken note of. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner: Social Justice Report 1999</title><page.no>13840</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>13840</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>In moving that the Senate take note of this document, I think it is very important that, with both documents Nos 2 and 3, given the current debate we are having surrounding mandatory sentencing and the current situation we find ourselves in with regard to the stolen generation, this report in particular is tabled before the federal parliament this week. These documents come about as a result of a requirement under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 that the Social Justice Commissioner be required to report annually on the `enjoyment and exercise of human rights by Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders'. One might find it rather ironic that, in this current debate, the commissioner is required to report on the enjoyment and exercise of human rights because, if you read his report on social justice, you will find that the situation is in fact far from that.</para><para>It is interesting to note that, in his report, the commissioner concentrates quite heavily on the situation occurring in the Northern Territory. In fact, about 80 per cent of this report refers to the situation in which Aboriginal people find themselves in the Northern Territory. It seems that that Territory is slowly becoming a blot on our national reputation with regard to indigenous people. This social justice report is the first by Dr William Jonas. It was presented to the Attorney-General on 20 January. It looks at four key issues: young people and human rights, identity, mandatory sentencing and bilingual education. It outlines some very useful statistics in relation to indigenous people and population, unemployment, secondary education, mortality and, of course, contact with the criminal justice system. It goes into some detail about mandatory sentencing and bilingual education. I also want to note that it makes some very interesting statements about statehood, the way in which statehood was treated in the Northern Territory, the way in which indigenous people voted and perhaps why they voted to reject statehood. It is interesting to see that, throughout his report, Dr Jonas makes a number of very interesting comments about the reconciliation process. In particular, in his summary of the statehood process in the Northern Territory on page 24 he says:</para><quote><para>A reconciliation process which is based on anything less than negotiation over these principles—</para></quote><para>the principles he is referring to are the principles of the reconciliation of distinct rights of indigenous people in the Northern Territory that flow from the now famous Kalkaringi statement—</para><quote><para>will join proposals such as the Social Justice Package as an empty, unfulfilled commitment to social justice for <inline font-style="italic">all</inline> Australians.</para></quote><para>It is interesting to note that the report actually makes a number of statements along these lines. He looks at the extent of indigenous disadvantage, from the perspective our future and our young people. He profiles what is happening with indigenous people between the ages of 15 and 29 years. He also considers the issues that the participants in the indigenous young people's forum considered: where they are, where they are going, and what they believe they need to do in order to contribute to their identity as indigenous people. He makes some very brave comments about the attempt by the Northern Territory government to abolish the bilingual education programs, and he writes about rights to education, language, cultural difference and self-determination for indigenous people. Given that this is the first report from the Social Justice Commissioner along these lines, it has some very telling points to make, particularly, as I said, about the extent of indigenous people in the Northern Territory. It makes very interesting reading and I have no doubt that I will continue my remarks at length on this matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13841</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As Senator Crossin has said, this is the first report from Dr William Jonas, the third Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. It is good to see that Dr Jonas acknowledges the great contribution made by his predecessors. On page 26 he has put in a paragraph which I think is worth repeating. He says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Dr Mick Dodson, the first Social Justice Commissioner, set the highest standards of advocacy for the human rights of Australia's Indigenous peoples and his achievements are lasting. Zita Antonios, who filled the role in an acting capacity for eighteen months, maintained this role in a period of intense public debate, increased workloads and great change. Both are to be warmly congratulated for their efforts. I have inherited from them a strong legacy from which to continue to advocate for the rights of Indigenous Australians.</para></quote><para>Dr Jonas sums it up well and properly pays tribute to Dr Dodson and Zita Antonios.</para><para>As Senator Crossin has so eloquently put it, this report deals with the criminal justice system and its effect on the indigenous community, particularly young indigenous people. We have not got time to go through the report in detail, but it does show that the matters Senator Crossin raised are supported by considerable evidence. You only have to look at table 19, for example, `Imprisonment rate by age'. If you look at the imprisonment rate at ages 20 to 24, which is when young males in particular tend to get themselves into trouble, you can see the contrast between indigenous males and non-indigenous people. </para><para>There is a need to seek an answer to the problem that the criminal justice system presents to indigenous people. One way we might go about doing that is to at least have some empathy with indigenous people—indeed, with people who are in the criminal justice system generally. I do not mean that we should be in any way soft on crime, but sentences should be proportionate to the crime. It is not an easy matter to serve a sentence in jail. No-one who is listening to this speech would like to be put into jail, and it is not simply because of the experience of being in jail; it is also because of what it does to your social standing. Most people would be very concerned that their reputation would be greatly tarnished by going to jail. Just imagine turning up to apply for a job and, in the list of the experiences of your life, you had to say, `I've been to jail.' Just as we want a high reputation, so do those who go into the jail system. The term that is spent in jail is not the only concern in the issue of mandatory sentencing; it is the terrible damage done to a young person's reputation. The crime itself is bad enough, but the greatest condemnation that this society can put on any person is to send him or her to jail, thus fixing a stain upon his or her reputation—justly in many cases. We ought to be very careful about who we are going to put in jail and who we are going to mark with damage to their reputation.

The report is a requirement under section 209 of the Native Title Act. It reports annually on the operation of the Native Title Act and its effect on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. I have to say from the outset that this is also not a particularly complimentary report on the activities of the government. It reveals the inadequacies of the Australian government's policies and practices in effectively dealing with the ongoing discrimination against indigenous peoples. It recommends a revised approach to indigenous equality. In this report Dr Jonas says:</para><quote><para>We need special remedial measures to overcome historically entrenched patterns of racial inequality, as well as active intervention to protect the distinct cultural characteristics of indigenous communities.</para></quote><para>He goes on to make a comment that public debate on indigenous issues has often been divisive, as we have seen recently, with scapegoating of indigenous people as somehow being privileged and enjoying special treatment compared with the general population. He goes on to say that the reality could not be further from the truth. In particular, this report considers the implications of the March 1999 decision of the committee on the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, commonly known as the CERD committee. That committee has found that the federal government's 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act of 1993 are in breach of Australia's obligations under the convention. An inquiry is being conducted by the federal parliamentary joint native title committee.</para><para>The CERD committee considered the amendments according to the two fundamental requirements of the convention: to treat all people equally and in a non-discriminatory manner, and to ensure the effective participation of indigenous people in decisions which affect them. The committee found that the amendments to the Native Title Act are discriminatory and were implemented without the informed consent of indigenous people. This report is important because it looks at these two fundamental principles in relation to three areas: the inadequacy of the minimum standards which are required of state governments in their management of native title regimes, the impact of the registration test on native title claims, and the impact of the amendments in the Native Title Act in relation to the native title representative bodies.</para><para>The introduction to this report is very telling. It says:</para><quote><para>The native title story has told us that reconciliation is not about Indigenous people proving they can be reconciled to a non-Indigenous way of life.

When asked whether they would repeal those allegedly discriminatory sections of the Native Title Act, he was unable to commit himself to doing so. Similarly with Senator Crossin. All she does is to try to promote the report but does not say what they would do in government. Indeed, we have been invited by Senator Crossin in her comments to consider the findings of the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. It would be interesting for the Australian people to be told that in the committee's recent report—this so-called independent committee—it only found its way clear in the reporting process to give two positives and 13 concerns to Australia. Indeed, if I can quickly explain, the UN committee classifies its reports into positive aspects and subjects of concern. </para><para>So, when they looked at Australia as a nation in relation to racial matters, what did they find? They found two positives and 13 concerns. But guess what? When they had a look at China they found six positives and only 10 concerns—three times as many positives as they were able to find for Australia and three fewer concerns than they found in Australia. Russia scored six positives as well and only four concerns. Guess what Cuba scored? One concern and four positives. So, if you were to decide which country to live in with respect to racially discriminatory practices and you read through the United Nations checklist of positives and concerns, you would undoubtedly choose Cuba according to the rationale of the committee of the United Nations that deals with the elimination of racial discrimination. Just take the tip: why is it that all the boat people seem to be wanting to come to Australia and not Cuba or China? I simply say to the people who sit on these United Nations committees: get a bit of rigour, get a bit of integrity, get a bit of factual information and get into the real world and then your reports may be considered with a degree of respect by the Australian people and, indeed, other people around the world.</para><para>In relation to the native title legislation, I completely reject that, in any way, it is racially discriminatory.

The immediate benefits of a successful bid for the Games are obvious for the region, but what are the medium and long-term impacts for the area? The world will focus its attention on Sydney when the Olympics arrive in September and it is vital for Western Sydney to take advantage of that unprecedented attention to ensure that the region continues long into the future to feel the benefits of hosting the Games. </para></talk.start><para>Most important of those impacts is the stimulus for economic growth. As one of the main industrial, agricultural and business centres in Australia, the Greater West's economic worth is $35 billion, with over 72,000 businesses and 1.5 million people. Western Sydney has to highlight the attractive investment and business opportunities the region has to offer. One of the region's most important attributes is its well-educated, productive and highly skilled work force. International companies are bringing their business to Sydney to exploit this valuable labour force to gain a foothold in the Asia-Pacific region. Crucial to this is the fact that 25 per cent of Sydney's work force are from non-English speaking backgrounds. They have valuable language skills and are ideally suited for operating in both Western and Asian business environments. The impact of business confidence and investment in Sydney's Greater West will be shown by the development of new industries. The IT industry is one which will have a major economic impact. According to recent reports, there are 18,000 people currently employed in IT in Western Sydney. The Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board estimates growth in information technology of an expected 300 per cent over the next five years in some parts of the region—Wollondilly, in particular, I understand. </para><para>There have to be strategies in place to make sure that Sydney takes advantage of the international exposure of the Olympics and realises the full economic impact of the Games—and I will touch on just a couple of those. Firstly, there is Investment 2000, an Australian business venture aimed at developing links to business and investment companies within Asia by giving Australia as broad a coverage as possible during the running of the Games. The focus will be on the labour market's strong potential, including our high education levels, skills availability, the Asian language resource and competitive salary levels. Secondly, the Australian Technology Showcase will promote the innovative qualities of New South Wales and Australian emerging technology industries to international executives in business and the media. Finally, the Olympics Business Roundtable has developed a strategy known as `Australia Open for Business' that seeks to ensure that the best features of the economy are on display when the Olympic spotlight focuses here in September.</para><para>In relation to jobs growth, industry investment and infrastructure development, the Greater West's economy is expected to grow by an average of $1 billion over the next three years and $1.5 billion over the next six after that. As a result of hosting the Games it is expected that an extra 200,000 jobs will be created by 2003. Many of those will be in the newly developed IT&amp;T industries as well as hospitality and tourism. In fact, the immediate impact of the Olympics is seen most dramatically in the investment in infrastructure development in the Greater West—take the Olympic site itself, for example. It is an incredible feat in engineering and construction. Its on-time completion is a testament to the Australian construction industry—completed, I might note, with minimal industrial action. The Homebush Olympic site is supplemented by the Dunc Gray Velodrome in Bankstown and the Penrith Lakes Olympic rowing course. All three venues create permanent landmarks for future generations to enjoy.</para><para>Three million dollars a day was spent on construction of the facilities for the Games, including the construction of the athletes village and a new rail loop built to increase commuter access to the site. A new urban park, twice the size of Centennial Park, has been established. It is part of 440 hectares of recreational parkland that covers the site. There is a public domain area that has the capacity to hold up to half a million people. The athletes village is an important development in the Greater West and will become a new suburb at the completion of the Games and the Paralympic Games. Named Newington, it will be the world's largest solar powered suburb. At a cost of $470 million, it will be completed in 2005. There will be an estimated 5,000 residents in the new suburb when the temporary dwellings have been removed and 2,000 permanent dwellings have been constructed. A primary school and other community facilities will be established out of the Games facilities. A business park development and neighbourhood retail centre will boost services in the surrounding region.</para><para>Even the proposed Parramatta rail link is another infrastructure development in the west stimulated by the Olympic economic boom. Costing $1.4 billion, it is expected to be completed by 2006 with an estimated patronage of 18.6 million people. We will obviously also have an increase in the numbers of tourists to the region, with an important flow-on effect for the entire economy of the Greater West. The Tourism Forecasting Council predicts an influx of 8.2 million visitors to our shores over the 21 days of the Games and the Paralympics after that. In the longer term the Games are predicted to attract 1.6 million tourists in the four years after the Olympics, according to the Tourism Forecasting Council. Of these, New South Wales can expect 1.1 million, providing a $4.2 billion windfall for the state's economy, as noted in a report from KPMG Management Consulting and Griffith University on this subject.</para><para>A most prevalent and culturally important impact of the Games is the very widespread development of sporting facilities in Western Sydney, giving the Greater West a very strong right to claim to be the sporting capital of the state, if not Australia. The Stadium Australia development was completed at a cost of $690 million and provides the largest outdoor venue in modern Olympic history. At the completion of the Games it will be reconfigured to seat 80,000 people. Even IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch described the Sydney Aquatic Centre as `the best swimming pool I have seen in my life'. That 4,400-seat venue will play host to a wide range of events in the longer term, ranging from World Cup swimming to the local school swimming carnivals. The Olympic velodrome in Bankstown will provide a long-term legacy for the people of Western Sydney. Not only will it attract world and national cycling circuits but the infield can be easily reconfigured to host exhibitions and other cultural events.</para><para>The Olympic site construction is based on the principle of the Green Games. Environmentally friendly practices were adopted in the construction of all of the venues and that has had an important impact on Western Sydney with the restoration of wasteland and the establishment of parklands in particular. The major long-term effect of the Green Games on Western Sydney has been the restoration of the Homebush Bay site. It was a disused environmental wasteland, previously the site of an armaments store, a chemical company, a garbage dump and a slaughterhouse. Not surprisingly, over time it became severely degraded land. Waste Services New South Wales was given the responsibility for the removal of contaminants on the site, placing the toxic waste in consolidated pits at Homebush Bay. It also dealt with restoration of the mangrove at Homebush Bay so that waste which does run off the site is filtered out before it hits the water system. That clean-up, that mangrove management, is a major environmental achievement. </para><para>What was a major toxic wasteland and absolute eyesore has been transformed into a sporting and recreational landmark for the nation. In fact, by September 2000 there will be five million shrubs and native grasses planted around the site, including the planting of an additional 200,000 trees—an additional important environmental legacy for Western Sydney. These parklands are a much-needed recreational resource in Sydney's Greater West and the use of green construction techniques and products in the Olympic venues will provide invaluable experience for future developments in the construction industry.</para><para>Finally, there are obviously also cultural questions attached to the staging of the Olympics and the Paralympics and, most particularly, the question of art. Twelve innovative public art projects have been commissioned for display at the Olympics. At a cost of $7.5 million, they will be on display at Homebush and in other areas of Western Sydney. Homebush Bay itself will feature nine public art projects. Some of these will be free standing and others will be worked into the surrounding environment. They will provide a creative and interesting landmark that will be appreciated by both the people of the Greater West and the visitors to the area. </para><para>The Olympics obviously provide an extraordinary opportunity for the people of the Greater West of Sydney to showcase all the exciting prospects that we have to offer. The long-term impacts of hosting the Games are both exciting and enormously beneficial. There are trade and business opportunities for Western Sydney. They will provide jobs growth and investment into the long term. The more medium term tourism impacts of the Olympics and the Paralympics will also assist in economic growth. The environmental impacts of the Games, such as the new parklands, are significant and advantageous for the people of Sydney and beyond. Finally, we have the record of the great sporting and cultural legacies which will be enjoyed by all Australians but most particularly by the Greater West long into the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Auditor-General's Report: Retention of Military Personnel</title><page.no>13846</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>13846</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak tonight to Auditor General's report No. 35 of 1999-2000—<inline font-style="italic">Retention of military personnel</inline>. This was a matter that was introduced in the chamber earlier last week but at that time I could not draw attention to it in the detail that I wish to tonight. Therefore I wish to speak to it this evening as I have had a long interest in the Defence Force, particularly the Reserves. </para></talk.start><para>This is an important document and one of which we should take note. This report goes to the very heart of the Defence Force's ability to retain the highly trained, efficient, motivated men and women that form the core of our nation's Army, Navy and Air Force. It is of great economic, strategic and moral importance that our Defence Force maintains the best possible retention rate of its personnel, both officers and enlisted full time and reserve personnel. The retention rate is economically important. The cost to the taxpayer of the extensive training of our Defence Force personnel is indeed significant. The retention rate is also strategically important. The loss of officers and enlisted personnel from the Defence Force results in the degradation of the military's corporate knowledge and its ability to serve our nation's interests in time of crisis and need. The retention of our service personnel is also morally important. High rates of separation from the military indicate to me that we are not providing our Defence Force personnel with an appropriate employment environment. To do this to men and women who have chosen to defend our nation with their lives in times of crisis is morally reprehensible.</para><para>The Australian Defence Force's involvement in the INTERFET peacemaking contingent is a continuation of the long and justifiably proud history of service to this nation by its officers and enlisted personnel. However, it could be argued that this high level of service is under threat. According to the Auditor-General's report, the Australian Defence Force, in the last 12 months, experienced an overall separation rate of 14 per cent. If this figure was not cause for concern, then the staggering 26.73 per cent separation rate of women from the Army during 1996-97 is. This rate is nearly three times the overall rate of separation in the Australian Defence Force. Clearly, a separation rate of this magnitude must have a detrimental effect on the morale and efficiency of the Australian Defence Force. This cannot be allowed to continue. The Australian Defence Force spends in excess of $31 million a year on recruiting new personnel, yet the Auditor-General's report states:</para><quote><para>Defence's career management agencies appear to have minimal staff.</para></quote><para>Many members of the ADF who were interviewed as part of this report said:</para><quote><para>... that they had rarely met a Defence career manager and did not feel they had any influence over their future.</para></quote><para>It was further reported that there `is no formal career management at the private level even though there is significant investment in the initial training of those members.' Any organisation, let alone the Australian Defence Force, where there is a general belief amongst members that they have little influence over their career progression, is going to have problems with morale and staff retention. </para><para>It would appear that the Defence Reform Program has further exacerbated feelings of the inadequate career progression of officers and enlisted personnel of the Australian Defence Force. Interviews conducted by the Auditor-General revealed that:</para><quote><para>Army and Navy personnel often stated that civilians are taking many jobs and posting options that rightfully belonged to Defence members.</para></quote><para>It was further reported that:</para><quote><para>... there is a common perception that the skills, experience and general capability of military personnel, and the ADF itself, are being eroded through the increasing use of civilian workers and that morale is being lowered.</para></quote><para>Clearly, Defence Force personnel either have lost, or are losing, faith in the Defence Reform Program. Many in the ADF are of the belief that the Defence Force reform package is only about `an increasing emphasis on efficiency' at the expense of their working conditions. The Auditor-General's report stated:</para><quote><para>... members consider that many of the savings reported in Defence Reform have been made only because they work longer hours and make do with reduced resourcing levels.</para></quote><para>Indeed, Australian Defence Force personnel state that they believe the Department of Defence is indifferent to the effect that continuous change is having on them both personally and professionally. Combine these feelings with reports of poor housing conditions for single personnel, the stresses that changes in postings place on ADF families and what is perceived by Defence personnel as an overall decline in military ethos, and you see a picture of a work environment that is far from optimal. </para><para>The Auditor-General's report found that:</para><quote><para>Defence could manage retention more effectively if it had a better understanding of the views of its members.</para></quote><para>The report went on to state:</para><quote><para>Defence attitude surveys and the re-introduction of exit surveys are examples of Defence attempts to obtain the information it needs to manage retention better.</para></quote><para>The gathering of information to manage retention better is a fine and worthwhile exercise by Defence. But it will be useless information if there is not the will, both within the Defence Force and the government, to genuinely want to improve the lives of our serving men and women. There must be adequate resources to provide good quality housing for all Defence personnel. The government must look sympathetically at the effects that serial postings can have on Defence families. The government needs to look at and understand the effects that the Defence Reform Program has had on the lives, morale and careers of Australian Defence Force personnel. Adequate resources need to be given to Defence's career management agencies so that ADF personnel can feel as though they have at least some control over their careers.</para><para>As I have previously stated, we have an economic and strategic imperative to maintain the best possible retention rate for Australian Defence Force personnel but, more importantly, we have a moral imperative to do so. The men and women of the Australian Defence Force have volunteered to serve their country. This does not give us the right to take their service for granted. Indeed, it obligates all of us to provide them with the best possible working environment we can. Any less is a betrayal of their trust in us as their political leaders.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Assault Charge: Acquittal</title><page.no>13848</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13848</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I recently experienced the ordeal of a criminal trial for criminal assault. I was acquitted. Some of the media said the jury took an hour to reach its decision. In fact, the judge instructed the jury to go off to lunch, and they returned their unanimous not guilty verdict immediately after lunch. I have had to experience 20 months of stress, considerable legal expense and an uncertain degree of damage to my reputation. For now, I wish simply to put some matters to do with my case on the record and to make a few observations about the process.</para></talk.start><para>I had pleaded not guilty to the charge of assault occasioning bodily harm. The charge stemmed from an incident that occurred 20 months earlier while I was walking my dog. It involved my little dog, Benji, a terrier-cross; Ms Wendy Arthur, now Marshall, and her great dane, Ebony Bear; and Mr Warren Marshall. Despite the fact that Mrs Marshall, Mr Marshall and I all gave evidence on oath that no-one saw a blow land on Mrs Marshall, she alleged that I deliberately struck her on the head after her dog, Ebony Bear, ran towards Benji. The facts of the matter are that her dog, Ebony Bear, ran towards and then attacked Benji; to defend Benji, I hit and kicked her dog. If Mrs Marshall was struck while this was happening, she was struck accidentally either by me or by her dog's face. While I regret that she may have been hurt in the melee, it was an accident. I abhor violence against women and, as I stated in court, at all times my actions were directed at her dog and stemmed from my heartfelt belief that Benji was being fatally attacked.</para><para>Given the enormous hardship that accompanies a criminal charge, a great deal of careful consideration ought to be entered into prior to proceeding with a prosecution. In my opinion, the charge I faced was without merit. The prosecution was costly to the taxpayer and costly and stressful to me, my family and my staff. I think it should never have proceeded. The Crown alleged that I deliberately hit Mrs Marshall. Mrs Marshall claimed to have felt a blow but not to have seen it. Mr Marshall, who was about 75 metres away, did not see a blow despite observing the whole incident. I certainly saw no such blow. The judge made this point in his instructions to the jury, and I quote:</para><quote><para>... there's no witness who has come into court and who has said `I saw the accused's hand hit Mrs Marshall on the head.'</para></quote><para>All witnesses agreed that they saw me being assaulted by Mr Marshall. Not only did Mr and Mrs Marshall not see me strike Mrs Marshall; each delivered testimony that was highly inconsistent with the other. Mrs Marshall made the extraordinary allegation that, while she was standing with her huge dog, I walked up behind her and hit her for no reason. Mr Marshall's testimony painted a different, inconsistent and ridiculous picture.</para><para>I find it most distressing that such a tenuous allegation could give rise to a costly and stressful 20-month ordeal such as the one I endured. There is no evidence for suspicions voiced to me that improper motives played a part in the process, whether of a political, personal or financial nature, or whether from vindictiveness or official incompetence. That cannot be known. All I do know is that a very serious allegation was made on the basis of an assertion of a blow to which there was no witness.</para><para>Compounding the damage to myself and my family was the media treatment. The media coverage was not biased or malicious, but it did have an impact. I read, watched and heard the media repeat again and again the allegation that I had criminally assaulted a woman, an allegation which, because of the process of law, I could not defend in the media until the second last day of 20 months when I could finally present my side of the story in court. The media can only report what is before them, and for 20 months what was before them was an allegation. It was naturally of interest to them because of my profile as a politician, and because of the real—if remote—threat of the loss of my job and the loss of jobs of my staff.</para><para>I have analysed print media coverage of the charge process and trial. The charge was brought against me on 25 July 1998. Someone leaked the news to the media within a hour of the police charging me. From the clippings which I have kept—which is not all the media coverage and does not include radio and television—prior to the trial on 7 March 2000, at least 310 centimetres of copy was printed in various newspapers throughout Australia detailing the charge and allegations made by Mrs Marshall. Media coverage was national, periodic and coincided with various procedural court appearances. The allegation hit the headlines in August, September and December 1998, and then again in March, May, June and October 1999 and January 2000. During the same period, just 52 centimetres of copy was printed detailing the fact that I intended to plead not guilty and my short statement of defence against the allegations made by Mrs Marshall. The media imbalance was obvious and naturally distressing, although I should again stress the media had no choice—they had only the allegation to go on with. After 20 long months, the trial began. Some of the media sat in the courtroom and for three days—7, 8 and 9 March this year—listened to the prosecution and defence, and then reported to the Australian public that I had been found not guilty of the charge. </para><para>Now let us look again at the figures. The trial commenced on 7 March this year, and the media devoted 85 centimetres of copy to the prosecution—to the allegations made against me by Mr and Mrs Marshall. From 8 March, the story was different—it was new, fresh, it was my defence. So, over just two days, I secured about 229 centimetres of copy on my defence. And then nothing. The story was no longer a story. The fact that I had been found not guilty would not be slowly filtered out to the public again and again over a 20--month period. Indeed, if you happened to be on holidays from 8 to 10March, you would have missed my defence of the allegation, missed the extremely important fact—to me at least—that I had been found not guilty.</para><para>I think the media coverage of my charge and case was very fair, but in percentage terms about 78 per cent of all print media coverage regarding this incident occurred before my trial, before my case was presented. Even if it is an unintentional consequence of the justice process, the constant repetition of an allegation does have a bias against the defendant. It is indicative of the hurt to reputation that can accrue to the innocent, despite the publication of the not guilty verdict and other favourable publicity on other matters.</para><para>Why do I raise these issues? Firstly, to be sure that as well as the transcript of the trial—and the judge's summation is particularly illuminating—this Senate has available at least a brief report from me on my trial. Secondly, to illustrate the troubles that are visited on public figures if criminal charges and the resultant media coverage are pursued when a case is quite flimsy. Thirdly, to illustrate that it is in the process of justice and publicity before the resolution of a case that unfairness and harm can accrue. We need to pay more attention to process, and I will have more to say on that at a later date.</para><para>The cost and the possible damage to my reputation remain. On the positive side, my compassion and concern for disadvantaged people facing criminal proceedings has not faded. It has been re-inforced. It is sometimes said that you can judge a society by the way it treats those it has charged and the way it treats those it has convicted. The treatment of accused persons also says a great deal about a society, and I have considerable misgivings about the operation of our criminal justice system after this experience—obviously, with particular reference to Western Australia. </para><para>In closing, I would like to say that in this parliament a great range of genuine supporters from all sides emerged who were keen to ensure that I was viewed as normal during the course of these events. I am deeply grateful to all those who offered their support to me over the trial period and throughout the 20 months.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Zimbabwe</title><page.no>13850</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>13850</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to speak about a relatively small country in Africa, one which I have visited on many occasions and one where the previous speaker, my colleague Senator Murray, has spent a great deal of his life. The country I speak of is Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe was taken over in a democratic sense—only in a sense—by the present incumbent, Mr Mugabe, in 1980. Zimbabwe is landlocked and lies between the countries of Mozambique to the east, Botswana to the south, and Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia, to the north. </para></talk.start><para>It is a particularly beautiful country in a lot of areas. In its most westerly extremity, it has one of the great, if not the greatest, outstanding natural features of the world—Victoria Falls. It is apt to note that that is one of the few names that survived after the 1980 takeover of the Smith government by Robert Mugabe. I have been to Victoria Falls, as I have been to a lot of Southern Africa, and it is indeed a wonderful country. In the south, the Limpopo River borders South Africa and Mozambique, and Zimbabwe has running through it the mighty Zambezi River, which is the source of the water for Victoria Falls.</para><para>However, Zimbabwe today is far from an ideal nation. It still has its beauty, but it has immense trouble. There is immense trouble for the 12 million-odd people that comprise Zimbabwe, 98 per cent of whom are African of Shona and Ndebele extraction. In recent times President Mugabe—76 years old and described through the media as a megalomaniac, as a despot and as someone bordering on evil, if not evil—has brought his country not just to its economic knees but has, in the most extraordinary manner, taken over 600 of the 1,400 or thereabouts producing farms owned by white Zimbabweans with no compensation. The method used was to beat drums and to chant outside the houses to intimidate the people inside their homes so much that the black African workers left the farms. Those farms are largely lying vacant and fallow today. They are not producing the necessary income for the bereft economy, and others will undoubtedly be taken over. The High Court found in Zimbabwe that the move by President Mugabe to do this without compensation was, in fact, illegal. But that did not stop this black despot. What he did was pass a law through his parliament that allowed him to do precisely that in defiance of the High Court of Zimbabwe. There are approximately 70,000 white Zimbabweans involved in the rural industries in Zimbabwe, and they are of course in great danger. Two innocent farmers have already been killed, many more have been injured and many more will be injured before this is resolved.</para><para>I might just dwell for a moment on what could have been in Zimbabwe, a country that is rich in nickel, gold, silver, platinum, diamonds and copper. It has vast amounts of fresh water. It has vast hydro potential for cheap electricity. Yet only 10 per cent of those people in Zimbabwe are employed in rural industries. President Mugabe last year and the year before sent an army off to the Congo to support President Laurent Kabila at vast cost to the Zimbabwean economy—or to what remained of it. The economy is suffering to the tune of 70 per cent inflation now. Fifty per cent of the people in Zimbabwe are unemployed. In 1980, when President Mugabe took over this jewel of colonial Africa, formerly Southern Rhodesia, the exchange rate between the Zimbabwean dollar and the British pound was 50p. Today, that has dropped not to 25p or to 10p but to 1.5p. Literacy has dropped from 59 per cent in 1980 to 42 per cent today. Today, life expectancy for the total population is 38.86 years. It is 38.77 for males and 38.94 for females. The infant mortality rate is 61.21 deaths per 1,000 live births. Those are not figures that one would expect from a country that was left in excellent order by the former Premier of Southern Rhodesia, Mr Ian Smith.</para><para>Those farmers that have been displaced—20,000 of those 70,000 that are in danger—are to be replaced and relocated as a result of an offer from the United Kingdom. I would like to think that my government, my Australia, would also make some offer to bring these people who are in grave danger to the safety of Australia, as we have done with many people over the years, particularly in the last half a century or so, remembering that Australia is a nation of migrants. If we did that we would save them from this, as he has been described, `evil black tyrant'. His invasion of the farms is suicidal in a political and economic sense. Whatever Mr Mugabe does there, he is not going to resolve his problem by allowing veterans of his 1970s war of independence, his liberation war, to take over these farms in a manner that is contrary to the law, and contrary to the law of Zimbabwe in particular.</para><para>He has, in effect, single-handedly destroyed what was one of the brightest prospects in Africa. Mining is practically non-existent now, notwithstanding the riches of Zimbabwe. The rural industry has declined to the degree where some food items are being imported. Yet this man sends thousands of troops to what was formerly the Congo to defend Laurent Kabila's regime in that central African country. It seems preposterous when people are starving, when the economy is one of the worst in southern Africa, when the country cannot feed itself, when exports have dried up and when it has become a mendicant state of southern Africa that is dependent upon the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other charitable organisations. It is unfair not just to those very friendly and affable people of Zimbabwe but particularly to those white Zimbabweans who stayed there and considered themselves nothing other than Zimbabwean.

Senator O'Brien's questions Nos 1366 and 1367 of 30 August 1999, the allocation and expenditure for the Regional Assistance Program (RAP) in the 1997-98 financial year was $20.3 million and $15.4 million respectively. In the 1998-99 financial year $33.3 million was notionally allocated for regional initiatives and a total of $19.979 million was expended. </para><para>The notional allocation and total expenditure for Area Consultative Committees (ACCs) in the 1997-98 financial year was $7 million and $9 million respectively. In the 1998-99 financial year $7 million was notionally allocated for ACCs and $8.3 million was expended.</para><para>In the 1999-2000 financial year the total allocation for RAP is $40.8million, $18.8 million for individual RAP projects, $10 million for ACCs. The remaining $12 million is allocated to Business Incubators ($5 million); Indigenous Small Business Fund ($2 million) and National Initiatives and Emergencies ($5 million). </para><para>As at 31 January 2000, total actual expenditure on 1999/2000 RAP projects is around $3 million of a total $8.9 million approved to date, with total actual expenditure of around $5 million on ACCs.</para><para>(2) The purpose of the RAP is to generate employment in metropolitan, regional and remote Australia by encouraging business and communities to take action to boost business growth and create sustainable jobs. This is achieved through the funding of projects, which provide job generation, enhance the skill base of a region, tackle disadvantage and encourage growth in a region. Further details of the programme are contained in the Guide for Area Consultative Committees and Project Proponents, a copy of which was provided to the honourable senator on 12 August 1999.</para><para>The purpose of ACCs is to work in partnership with government, business and the community to identify and foster opportunities for jobs growth, skills development and regional growth, and to find community based solutions to these issues. ACCs also play an important role in RAP by identifying, encouraging, endorsing and supporting the development and implementation of suitable projects. This description is incorporated and expanded upon in the Charter and Role of ACCs, a copy of which was provided to the honourable senator in May 1999.</para><para>(3) A list provided by my department and based on historical data of approved RAP projects since RAP commenced on 1 July 1997 to the end of financial year 1998-99 in response to the Hon Senator O'Brien's question No 1368 of 30 August 1999, has previously been provided to the honourable senator. </para><para>A further list of the first round of RAP projects approved in financial year 1999-2000 was provided to the honourable senator by my department in response to questions put to it in the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on 2 December 1999. </para><para>My department has updated the list of RAP projects to include those approved to date in financial year 1999-2000 which is being separately supplied to the honourable senator (a copy of this list is also held in the Senate Table Office).</para><para>I am advised by my department that, in the near future, details of projects as they are approved will be able to be accessed through the Internet at www.acc.gov.au.</para><para>Information on National Initiatives and Emergencies component is included in the attached list (Attachment A - Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office).</para><para>I am advised by my department that information on ACCs for the financial year 1997-98 is not readily available and that the resources required to obtain it would represent an unwarranted diversion of the resources of the Department. A copy of information sought on ACCs for the 1998-99 financial year, prepared in response to the Hon Senator O'Brien's question No 1370 of 30 August 1999, was provided directly to the honourable senator by my department following the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on 2 December 1999. </para><para>A list of ACCs in receipt of funding assistance funded this financial year (1999-2000) is attached (Attachment B - Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office).</para><para>(4) The list provided by my department in response to Question (3) above contains the information sought by the honourable senator for RAP projects approved this financial year (1999-2000) through the new approval process, under which such information is now captured. </para><para>I am advised by my department that to provide information additional to that already provided on RAP projects approved prior to the introduction of the new approval process would require a search of historical data across all states and territories and represent an unwarranted diversion of departmental resources. Further, I am advised my department could not guarantee that the result of such a search would be comprehensive. </para><para>The information sought by the honourable senator in relation to ACCs is contained in the list on ACCs provided in response to Question (3). Details on each ACC can also be located on the Internet at www.acc.gov.au.</para><para>Information on the National Initiatives and Emergencies component is also provided in the list provided in response to question (3) above.</para><para>(5) I am advised by my department that it does not record details of public announcements of particular RAP projects. Each round of approved RAP projects is announced by my colleague the Minister for Employment Services, the Hon Tony Abbott MP in conjunction with the Ministers for Transport and Regional Services and Education Training and Youth Affairs. A copy of the relevant media releases, which incorporates the date of announcement, is attached (Attachment C - Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office).</para><para>Minister Abbott also writes to each ACC Chair and each local member advising them of projects approved in their regions.</para><para>ACC funding is not subject to an announcement process. </para><para>The announcement of projects under the National Initiatives and Emergencies component (refer to the attached table for details - Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office) is managed on a case-by-case basis. The Visy project was announced at a ceremony on 4 November 1999 at Tumut, NSW, attended by the Minister for Finance, the Hon John Fahey MP and the Premier of NSW the Hon Bob Carr. </para><para>(6) The approval process for RAP is described in the Guide for Area Consultative Committees and Project Proponents, a copy of which was provided to the honourable senator by my department on 12 August 1999. </para><para>In brief, proposals are submitted to the relevant State/Territory office of my department. All proposals submitted must be endorsed by ACCs if they are to be considered for funding. The State/Territory offices of my department assess proposals and make recommendations for approval to the National Office of my department. Projects are approved by the Group Manager, Regional Delivery Group, Ms Dianne Hawgood, and the Secretary of the Department, Dr Peter Shergold. </para><para>I am advised by my department that the names of successful applicants under RAP for the 1999/2000 year to date is contained in the list provided in response to Question (3) above. The number of applications not approved for 1999/2000 was 35 in the first quarterly round and 24 in the second quarterly round. </para><para>In relation to the provision of the names of unsuccessful applicants, my department advises that, until the formal introduction of the new application form which clearly states that any information provided to the department will be considered public information, such information comprises personal information and therefore subject to privacy considerations. </para><para>There is no approval process in relation to ACCs.</para><para>Projects under the National Initiatives and Emergencies component are approved on a case-by-case basis by Government.</para><para>Rural and Regional New Apprenticeships (RRNA)</para><para>Rural and Regional New Apprenticeships are the responsibility of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I understand that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is in the process of answering Question 1863, which also incorporates RRNA.</para><para>Project contracting available under Job Network</para><para>(1) Project Contracting is one of the services under Job Network. A total of $2 727 096 was allocated for harvests commencing in 1998 and this was disbursed over the period July 1998 to August 1999. For harvests commencing in 1999, a total of $2 200 200 has been allocated. As at 7 February 2000, a total of $1 540 040 has been disbursed.</para><para>(2) Project Contracting is a service provided through Job Network to ensure the satisfactory supply of labour to harvest areas that require considerable numbers of out-of-area workers to supplement local labour in order to harvest crops.</para><para>Project Contracting services have been paid since 1998, with the commencement of Job Network.</para><para>(3) &amp; (4) Details of harvest areas and Job Network members allocated contracts under Project Contracting in 1998 and 1999 are set out in the following table (Attachment D- Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office). The amount of money paid to individual Job Network members is commercial-in-confidence until contracts have been completed and payment finalised.</para><para>(5) In relation to the 1998-99 Employment Services Contract, details of successful tenderers were announced by the Hon David Kemp MP, Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs on 26 February 1998.</para><para>For the 2000-2003 Employment Services Contract, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, Minister for Employment Services, announced on 3 December details of tenderers who have been made conditional offers of business for the second Job Network contract.</para><para>(6) The approval process for Job Network tenders is outlined in the Employment Services Request for Tender 1997 and Employment Services Request for Tender 1999. These documents set out the principles and tendering conditions guiding the selection of tenders. The foremost principle was value for money for the Commonwealth Government. Value for money involved the optimum combination of quality of service as well as factors such as coverage, price and meeting the needs of the client group, and minimising the risk exposure of the Commonwealth.</para><para>The other important principle guiding the process was open, fair and effective competition for the employment services tender. To help ensure this occurred, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (DEWRSB) (and in its previous form, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) appointed Blake Dawson Waldron - Lawyers, to act as Probity Advisers to the employment services tenders. For both tenders, the department also adopted a Probity Plan, which detailed the various issues and steps to be followed throughout the tendering process.</para><para>The Employment Services Request for Tender, 1997 and 1999 both outlined the tendering conditions that were applied to all tenderers. There were a number of stages to the tender process (including checks for conformance and quality assessment against the selection criteria) through which tenderers progressed leading to final decisions by the Departmental Secretary.</para><para>All information on individual tenders is bound by the confidentiality and commercial-in-confidence provisions as stated in the Employment Services Request for Tender, 1997 and 1999. I am therefore not in a position to further release details about successful and unsuccessful applicants.</para><para>Small Business Enterprise Culture Program (SBECP)</para><para>(1) The total amount of funding is $6.4m over three years 1999-2000 to 2001-2002. As at 14 March 2000, $576,384 have been disbursed.</para><para>(2) The purpose of the Small Business Enterprise Program is to provide funding for the development of business skills for small business owners and managers and to demonstrate the contribution that such skills can make to business viability and growth.</para><para>(3) The Program did not exist in 1996. The First Round successful applicants were announced on 5 January 2000. (see Attachment E- Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office).</para><para>(4) Attachment E (Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office) provides a list of the successful projects under this Program.</para><para>(5) Minister Reith, Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business publicly announced relevant details of the successful applicants under SBECP on 5 January 2000.</para><para>(6) Approval process:</para><para>The approval process comprised two different streams.</para><para>. The National projects were assessed by Commonwealth officers of the Office of Small Business and the final selections were carried out by the assessment panel and the Program Delegate.</para><para>. The Regional projects were assessed initially by the Area Consultative Committees which endorsed one project from each area; these projects were then assessed by Commonwealth officers of the Office of Small Business, the assessment panel and the Program Delegate.</para><para>No of applications:</para><para>. There were 126 applications received in the first round of funding.</para><para>Successful applicants:</para><para>. A list of the successful applicants and a short description of the project is attached. (Attachment E- Copies of the Attachment are available from the Senate Table Office).</para><para>Unsuccessful applicants:</para><para>.

The trenches are covered with clean soil, which is mounded from 0.6 to 3.0 metres above grade to facilitate water run-off. Marker layers of plastic have been placed above the contaminated debris in the Taranaki debris trench. The trenches are unlined. </para><para>The contaminated debris has been placed in trenches in a stable geological environment which is unlikely to experience erosion. </para><para>The integrity of the trenches will be routinely inspected under the long-term stewardship management plan for the site.</para><para>There has been no evidence of plutonium dissolving in the groundwater and moving since the time of the testing at Maralinga. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation undertook solubility studies on plutonium in the Maralinga environment and the results showed that the plutonium had a very low solubility. This indicates that there is very little risk of plutonium leaching into the groundwater. In any event, the groundwater at Maralinga is very salty and is not suitable for consumption by humans or animals. There is no deep, fresh water source in or nearby Maralinga, so water from the area will not travel to regions where water from the water table is consumed.</para><para>(2) At Maralinga, the circumstances giving rise to the likelihood of radiation exposure, were already in place when decisions about the control of those risks were made. Remedial work was carried out to reduce an existing risk. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Maralinga clean-up is an `intervention'. It is, therefore, incorrect to use the term `disposal' in relation to the treatment of the contaminated material at Maralinga. Using IAEA terminology, radioactive waste `disposal' situations are `practices' in that radiation exposures and their likelihood can be restricted from the start. </para><para>(a) The Maralinga Rehabilitation Project has been undertaken consistent with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements for `interventions' outlined in the 1996 publication International Basic Safety Standards for the Protection Against Ionising Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources, Safety Series 155. </para><para>(b) Comparisons cannot usefully be made between the requirements of an `intervention' (Maralinga) and a `practice'(waste management). If the question concerning waste disposal “proposed for uranium waste in South Australia” refers to the national radioactive waste repository, it should be noted that the repository is not being established for the management of uranium waste, but for the disposal of waste arising from Australia's use of radioactive materials in medicine, research and industry. Uranium mine tailings are managed at the relevant mine site.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
