This national scheme harnesses the strengths of our Federation by providing for Commonwealth leadership while also respecting the role of the States in delivering on-ground management of heritage places.  </para><para>The Commonwealth's existing heritage conservation regime, based on the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, is now seriously outdated and subject to significant limitations.  In 1975 the AHC Act represented best practice, and its enactment was an important step in demonstrating Commonwealth leadership in relation to heritage conservation.  Within this framework, the Australian Heritage Commission has performed its role with distinction over the last 25 years.  But the case for reform is now compelling.</para><para>The Register of the National Estate, maintained under the AHC Act, now contains over 13,000 places.  Some of these places are of national heritage significance, but many should properly be regarded as places of State or local significance.  As a result of these 13,000 entries, the Commonwealth is often involved in matters that are not appropriately the responsibility of a national government.  The current regime therefore creates unnecessary intergovernmental duplication and imposes unnecessary costs on the community and industry.  </para><para>It is also important to recognise that the AHC Act provides no substantive protection for heritage places of national significance.  The limited procedural safeguards in the AHC Act fall well short of contemporary best practice in heritage conservation.  It is probably accurate to say that the AHC Act is designed to prevent uninformed decisions, but not unwise decisions.</para><para>In addition, the statutory process in the AHC Act is initiated by indirect triggers, such as foreign investment approval.  This adds to the uncertainty and delay, and limits the capacity of the AHC Act to provide any real benefit for heritage conservation.   </para><para>While the AHC Act pioneered the identification of heritage, all States and Territories now have heritage protection legislation.  The AHC Act fails to recognise and accommodate the development of State and local heritage conservation regimes.  This adds to the level of intergovernmental duplication and creates confusion in the community about the respective roles of different levels of government.  </para><para>In establishing a new national heritage conservation regime, the reforms implemented through the Bill will address the shortcomings of the existing regime.  In particular, the reforms will give effect to the outcomes of the 1997 Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment.  COAG agreed on the need to rationalise existing Commonwealth/State arrangements for the identification and protection of heritage places.  In this context, COAG agreed that the Commonwealth's role should be focussed on places of national heritage significance.  </para><para>Consistent with the COAG Agreement, the Bill establishes a mechanism for the identification of heritage places of national significance.  Such places will be inscribed on a National Heritage List.  This List will consist of natural, historic and indigenous places that are of outstanding national heritage significance to the nation as a whole.  The List may also include overseas sites where we have an agreement with the sovereign country—Anzac Cove being an example of such a potential listing. </para><para>The listing process will be open and transparent and will include a mechanism for consideration of public nominations.  Most importantly, the Minister will be guided in his or her decision-making by advice from an independent body of heritage experts—the Australian Heritage Council.  </para><para>Places on the National List will be identified under the EPBC Act as a matter of national environmental significance.  This will ensure that, for the first time ever, heritage places of truly national significance receive appropriate statutory protection.  A rigorous and efficient assessment and approval process will apply to actions that are likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of a place on the National List.  The EPBC Act provides a framework for Commonwealth/State co-operation in relation to this assessment and approval process.  </para><para>The Bill will also provide for the identification and protection of places on Commonwealth land—Commonwealth Heritage Places.  For the first time there will be a single list of Commonwealth places that have significant heritage value.  A public nomination and listing process similar to that for the National List will apply in relation to the Commonwealth List.</para><para>With the repeal of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the Register of the National Estate will no longer be a statutory register. However, the information on the Register will continue to be publicly available as a heritage information resource. </para><para>The Bill implements the Government's election policy commitments relating to heritage. In presenting this Bill, and through the creation of an independent statutory Australian Heritage Council, the Government is demonstrating its commitment to ongoing national leadership in relation to heritage conservation.  In doing so, the Bill delivers on community expectations in relation to what a contemporary heritage regime should provide for the nation. </para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2000</para><quote><para>The Australian Heritage Council Bill 2000 establishes the Australian Heritage Council as the nation's primary heritage advisory body.

In particular it will create a significant deterrent to those who seek to obstruct and frustrate the Authority's hearing process.  At the same time, the Bill contains important accountability measures, notably a role for the Ombudsman and clearer reporting requirements to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Authority.</para><para>The National Crime Authority was established in 1984 as a national law enforcement agency whose purpose was to combat serious and organised crime, without the limitations imposed by jurisdictional boundaries.   </para><para>The continuing support for the activities of the Authority, from Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, reflects the important role played by the Authority.   There is no doubt, however, that the problems caused by serious and organised crime operating across jurisdictional boundaries, continue to pervade all levels of society.  This reinforces the need for a national law enforcement agency such as the National Crime Authority.</para><para>The National Crime Authority does not deal with simple street level crime, but with the web of complex criminal activity engaged in by highly skilled and resourceful criminal syndicates. </para><para>It is therefore essential that the Authority has sufficient powers to enable it to perform its functions without being hindered or hampered by those whose very conduct the Authority is trying to investigate.  </para><para>It is also essential that the Authority is able to operate in an environment that enables the greatest possible flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the Authority remains accountable and responsive.</para><para>This Bill amends the National Crime Authority Act 1984, Ombudsman Act 1976, Privacy Act 1988 and Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to: </para></quote><para>·	implement the Government's response to the 3rd evaluation of the National Crime Authority by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority; and</para><para>·	address a number of matters relating to the administration and operations of the Authority.</para><quote><para>The Authority's task in investigating organised crime has been particularly difficult because of the way persons under investigation have manipulated existing legal rules and procedures to defeat the investigation.  If a person refuses to answer a question in a hearing, it is possible for that refusal to be litigated through the courts, with delays of months or even years.  In the interim, an investigation might be entirely frustrated, such that when proceedings are concluded and questioning can continue, the criminal trail has gone cold.  Even worse, penalties for failure to answer a question at an NCA hearing have regularly been very modest—a few hundred dollars.  This is not much of a deterrent where obstructing the Authority can impede an investigation that might have led to a person being gaoled for years for a serious offence such as drug trafficking.</para><para>Accordingly, the maximum criminal penalty for failing to answer a question at a hearing will be substantially increased under the Bill, from 6 months prison and a $1,100 fine to 5 years imprisonment and a $20,000 fine.  Other criminal penalties relating to non-compliance with the Authority's investigatory powers will be increased to the same level.</para><para>The Bill will also allow an investigatory body to derive evidence from self-incriminatory evidence given by a person at a hearing, and for a prosecuting authority to use that derived evidence against the person at a later trial.  In other words, a person's self-incriminatory admissions won't themselves be able to be used as evidence against that person, but will be able to be used to find other evidence that verifies those admissions or is otherwise relevant to proceedings.</para><para>However, the Bill will specifically provide that once a witness has claimed that the answer to a question might tend to incriminate him or her, then any evidence that the person gives cannot be used against the person in any later trial.  The existing mechanism for a special undertaking by the DPP will not be required; this protection will be clearly set out in the legislation.</para><para>In addition, the Bill will remove the uncertain defence of "reasonable excuse" for conduct such as failing to answer a question, and replace it with more clearly defined Criminal Code defences such as intervening event and sudden emergency.  The removal of the defence of "reasonable excuse" will also mean that a witness is no longer able to delay the Authority's hearing process by challenging, in the Federal Court, the Authority's decision that he or she did not have a reasonable excuse for, amongst other things, failing to answer a question.</para><para>The Bill will also introduce a contempt regime to enable the Authority to deal immediately and effectively with conduct that interferes with or obstructs its hearing process.  The provision will enable the Authority to apply to the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which it is holding the hearing for the Court to deal with the conduct as if it were contempt of that Court. In addition, the Bill will provide that the contempt regime will be excluded from the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to prevent collateral challenges to the contempt process.  Such challenges can be used to delay and frustrate investigations and prosecutions.</para><para>I am well aware that the modification of the immunity provided in relation to compelled answers will cause mixed feelings on the part of some in the community.  Some will be concerned about the other steps that are proposed to `strengthen the arm' of the NCA.  The Government is persuaded that these measures are a necessary response to a very serious problem.  The issues were fully canvassed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee in its report to which this Bill is a response.  The PJC received submissions from a wide range of persons (50 in number), as well as taking oral evidence from over 60 witnesses.  The position taken by this Bill is not a hasty or knee-jerk response—it is a well thought through and considered approach to a most pernicious evil, and the product of wide and lengthy consultation.   </para><para>I will be encouraging the referral of the Bill to a Parliamentary Committee so that the issues can be explored once again.  I encourage everyone with an interest in these issues, or with a view on the measures that are proposed by the Bill, to participate fully in that Committee process.</para><para>Other, and less contentious, measures are proposed by the Bill.  The administrative matters addressed by the Bill are designed to enhance the overall operational effectiveness of the National Crime Authority. </para><para>The scope of references will be expanded to enable the Authority to investigate offences that occur after the date of the reference.  The role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in relation to access to information held by the Authority will be clarified, as will the ability of the Authority to disseminate information to overseas agencies.   In addition, the maximum term of appointment of members of the Authority will be increased from 4 to 6 years, to increase continuity in relation to matters dealt with by the Authority.   The class of persons who may issue search warrants will be expanded to include magistrates and the class of person who may apply for a warrant will be expanded to include the members of the staff of the Authority.</para><para>The Bill will introduce the concept of hearing officers, who will be appointed by the Governor-General on the unanimous recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Committee of the National Crime Authority.  The hearing officers will only be empowered to conduct hearings on behalf of the Authority, thereby increasing the investigatory capacity of the Authority but without expanding the category of "members".</para><para>In recognition of the referral nature of the Authority's activities, and the specialised expertise that the Authority may need from time to time in a particular location for the purpose of investigating a particular reference, the Bill will provide that the Chairperson of the Authority may employ staff otherwise than under the Public Service Act 1999.  </para><para>The Bill will also clarify a number of matters such as the power of the Authority to control who may be present at hearings; the application of legal professional privilege; the use of reasonable force in the execution of a warrant; and that a prohibition on disclosure relating to the Authority's process overrides any contrary requirement under the Privacy Act 1988 for so long as the prohibition remains in force.  In relation to the last issue, the Bill will insert a note into the Privacy Act 1988 to alert the reader of that Act to the requirements of the NCA Act.</para><para>Minor administrative matters include adopting the definition of "document" from the Evidence Act 1995 and including the offences of  "money laundering" and "perverting the course of justice" in the definition of relevant offence, repealing ambiguous provisions, and enabling the Chairperson of the Authority to delegate certain powers.</para><para>In terms of the Authority's accountability, a fundamental reform proposed in the Bill concerns the mechanism for investigating complaints.  The Bill will amend the Ombudsman Act 1976 to extend the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the Authority.  </para><para>The amendments will deem the Authority to be a prescribed authority for the purposes of the Ombudsman Act and this will have the effect of enabling the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the Authority, members of the Authority, and members of the staff of the Authority.  The amendments will also give the Commonwealth Ombudsman discretion to transfer a complaint to a more appropriate authority (for example, a State agency for a complaint against a State officer); and enable joint investigations.  Both are matters within the powers of the  Ombudsman in relation to complaints against other authorities or Departments.  In addition the amendments will provide that the Attorney-General may issue certificates preventing the disclosure of certain information to or by the Ombudsman.  The Attorney-General will only issue such a certificate when the disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest by reason that it would prejudice, amongst other things, the safety of a person or the effectiveness of an investigation being conducted by the Authority.</para><para>The amendments made by the Bill will result in a more effective and efficient National Crime Authority to grapple with the ever-increasing complexities of organised and serious crime. This is an important measure, prepared in consultation with States and Territories, which will enhance our capacity to address such crime at a national level. </para></quote><para>—————</para><para>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONCESSION CARDS) BILL 2000</para><quote><para>Since its election in 1996, this Government has sought to implement its commitment to a simpler and more coherent social security system that more effectively meets its objectives of adequacy, equity, incentives for self-provision, customer service and administrative and financial sustainability.</para><para>That commitment can be met in part by seeking to ensure that social security legislation is routinely reviewed to both to improve its readability and to ensure that it facilitates the implementation of current and new policies.</para><para>Last year this Parliament passed the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 which was a major step forward in achieving these objectives.  The Act substantially simplified the technical rules and provisions of the social security law.</para><para>The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Concession Cards) Bill 2000 is a further step towards meeting the Government's objectives to achieve a simpler and more coherent social security system because it represents a major simplification of the law relating to concession cards.</para><para>As a result of this Bill, all law relating to concession cards issued by the Family and Community Services portfolio will be consolidated in the social security law.</para><para>As part of this process, existing administrative rules and practices will be codified to ensure that those who currently have a concession card continue to qualify for that card on the same basis as they currently qualify.  This has been done to avoid having winners or losers from the process of making transparent the law relating to the issue of concession cards.</para><para>Access to a concession card is a fundamental component of the Government's welfare safety net. Access to a concession card is a significant benefit to those who qualify.  At the Commonwealth level the concession card provides access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits under the National Health Act 1953.  It can also be used to access a range of other benefits provided by State, Territory, local government and many businesses.</para><para>The law currently governing concession cards issued by Centrelink on behalf of the Department of Family and Community Services is highly fragmented.</para><para>This causes confusion for social security customers and Centrelink staff who issue the cards.</para><para>Some provisions are contained in the Health Insurance Act 1973, others in the National Health Act 1953 and yet others are under the social security law.  For example, the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act contain provisions that specify who is entitled to concessional pharmaceutical benefits.  However, appeal rights in relation to concessional pharmaceutical benefits for pensioner concession card and health care card holders are covered by the social security law.</para><para>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs recognised the problem in its 1997 report: Concessions—Who benefits—Report on concession card availability and eligibility for concessions.  The Committee recommended that the legislative framework be rationalised to include the bulk of concession entitlement provisions in the social security law rather than in legislation admin-istered by the then Health and Family Services portfolio.</para><para>Like the 1999 exercise, this Bill does not involve any major policy initiatives and it does not have any financial impact.</para></quote><para>·	The more significant of the minor policy initiatives implemented by the Bill relate to:</para><para>·	making a person's entitlement to concessional pharmaceutical benefits dependent on the person's status as a holder of a concession card issued under the social security law;</para><para>·	using the social security and family assistance law definitions of "dependant" and removing the need to rely on definitions of "dependant" in the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act;</para><para>·	using the social security law definition of "resident" rather than the National Health Act and Health Insurance Act definition.  This makes the question of determining who is qualified for a card much simpler to administer and ensures that there is consistency between qualification for a social security pension or benefit and qualification for a card;</para><para>·	conferring administrative review rights in relation to decisions on health care cards for persons receiving carer allowance.  Such decisions are not reviewable at the moment under section 4CA of the Health Insurance Act;</para><para>·	providing a power for the Minister to declare a person eligible to receive a health care card in limited circumstances; and</para><para>·	utilising the machinery provisions of the social security law in relation to pensioner concession cards and health care cards in a manner consistent with current administrative practices. </para><quote><para>This Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to the ongoing review of the legislative basis underlying the social security system so as to achieve a simpler and more coherent system.</para></quote><para>—————</para><para>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 2000</para><quote><para>The amendments provided for in this Bill are necessary to allow the introduction of a redeveloped and refined system for electronically listing medicines, except those to be listed for export-only, on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (the Register).</para><para>The current electronic lodgement system for listing medicines for supply in Australia was developed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in co-operation with the industry and provides for listable medicines to be marketed more quickly through the electronic lodgement of applications.  Listable medicines are considered to be of low risk based on their ingredients and therapeutic indications/claims.  Most complementary medicines (such as herbal, vitamin and mineral products) and sunscreens, and some over-the-counter medicines fall into this category.  There have been concerns that the current listing system, whilst an improvement over the previous paper-based system, does not fully meet the needs of industry for streamlined market access for their listed medicines.</para><para>A new refined listing system has been developed, which seeks to assure the safety and quality of, and maintain consumer confidence in, listed medicines that may be supplied in Australia, whilst facilitating quicker market access by applicants.  This is to be achieved by finding a better balance of responsibilities for industry and the TGA under a co-regulatory framework. </para><para>In the new listing system, strict standards of quality and safety will continue to apply to listed medicines and sponsors will continue to be required to hold evidence to support the claims they make in relation to these medicines.  However, under the changes introduced by the Bill sponsors of listed medicines will have greater responsibilities in relation to pre-market assessment of the medicines they wish to list on the Register and the TGA will assume greater post-market monitoring responsibilities in relation to listed medicines.  </para><para>The amendments in this Bill provide for a medicine to be listed in the Register following self-assessment by the applicant, provided the requirements of section 26A are met.  </para><para>Under section 26A the applicant certifies that the medicine meets certain criteria for listable medicines and that the information in, or with, the application is correct.  Changes made by the Bill introduce additional matters that are required to be certified in relation to the manufacture of the medicine. The changes also require the applicant to certify that evidence is held to support any claim made in relation to the medicine. These changes will increase the accountability of the applicant in relation to the listing of the medicine.</para><para>The amendments in the Bill empower the Secretary to cancel the listing of a medicine that is not eligible for listing or is an exempt good.  This allows for cancellation of goods that should never have been listed.  The Secretary is also empowered to cancel the listing of a medicine where there is a serious breach of the requirements related to advertising such that the presentation of the medicine is misleading to a significant extent.  If an applicant fails to respond within 20 working days to a request for information, and the request was made for the purpose of determining if a medicine should have been listed, the Secretary is empowered to cancel the listing of that medicine.  Post-market monitoring of listed medicines is strengthened by these changes.</para><para>New offences have been created for the making of false or misleading statements in relation to certification of matters for the listing of medicines under section 26A or where false and misleading information is provided in compliance with a request for information relating to the medicine.  The electronic listing system relies heavily on information provided by the applicant and self-assessment by the applicant.  There is the potential for serious public health consequences if a medicine were to be listed or remain listed on the basis of false or misleading information.  The penalties are designed to discourage the provision of inaccurate information.</para><para>The new listing system has been developed by the TGA in co-operation with industry and consumer representatives and is supported by the key stakeholder groups.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of these bills be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 autumn sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21032</page.no><id.no>R1197</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Referral to Committee</title><page.no>21032</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vanstone</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority for inquiry and report by 1 March 2001.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21032</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs References Committee</title><page.no>21032</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>21032</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21032</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on public hospital funding, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>In rising to speak to this report, I first take the opportunity to thank those people who were involved with getting the report produced. In particular, I want to thank the secretariat of the Community Affairs References Committee: Elton Humphery, Paul Mackay—seconded from the Department of the Parliamentary Library—Christine McDonald, Peter Short, Leonie Peake and Ingrid Zappe. I am very pleased to note that the names of the committee secretariat are recorded in the report—a principle I would like to see followed more often. When history comes to look at what we said, I think it would be very nice that history could find out who helped us say it. I also want to thank the Library for the secondment of Paul Mackay, who has responsibility in the Library for research in the areas of health and health funding. It is an arrangement that can happen and does infrequently happen. I would like to acknowledge the great assistance that that arrangement, and Paul Mackay himself, has been to our report.</para><para>It has been a very timely and very fruitful inquiry. We had some 93 submissions. We received over 6,700 postcards and emails in support of Medicare and the public health system. We held eight days of public hearings and, importantly, we had two roundtables. Both of those were not entirely unprecedented but very close to that. I hope that the Senate committees, in their discussions formally and in the corridors, will check out how the roundtables went, because they were a very constructive and productive way in which our hearings and inquiry came to its final conclusions.</para><para>People need to remember that this report arose from the premiers and chief ministers arriving in Canberra in the middle of last year—that is, 1999—seeking from Mr Howard and Mr Costello an inquiry by the Productivity Commission into the funding for public hospitals. All around the country there was an agreement that the hospitals were significantly underfunded. The government refused to initiate that inquiry, so it fell to the Senate. I think one has to say that this has been a very thorough and very non-partisan exercise. It is an inquiry that has produced a remarkable breadth of support for the recommendations or at least the main thrust of the recommendations—in particular, that the public hospitals are significantly underfunded and that the recommendation of the independent arbiter, Mr Castles, of some further $450 million to the public hospitals over the next two years should be supported. </para><para>The committee also found consistently that the community, the people involved in hospitals, the practitioners, the bureaucrats—most everybody—had got to the stage of realising that blame shifting and cost shifting between the Commonwealth and state governments had long since passed its use-by date; it was a sheer waste of time and a waste of money. We cannot tell you how much the cost shifting actually amounts to. But we can say that participants, particularly from the roundtables where we heard from senior bureaucrats from Commonwealth and state level, senior health economists, senior practitioners and deliverers of health from the medical area, the whole range of specialties in hospitals, the nursing profession and allied health professions, and members of the community, were of one voice when they said it is time to stop the cost shifting and the blame shifting and move on. It is time to move on. It is important to acknowledge that the second recommendation is that, if we are asking the Commonwealth to increase its funding, the states should be asked to match the percentage increase as part of the improved funding to our public hospitals. The community very much wants to see adequate funding for public hospitals. It wants the support, security and back-up that the great public hospitals have provided—and still do, even while straining at the edges. It is very important to note, as I have said, that this report received widespread support. Its recommendations address the issues of adequately funding our public hospitals. </para><para>As always happens, I have only just very recently received a copy of the report and very quickly had an opportunity to look at the government's objection to the majority report of the opposition and the Democrats. I find it disappointing that once again the government suggests that this is a partisan report. I strongly object to that: it is not. The government also suggests that a lot of the issues are really about states and funding or they are already under way and the inquiry really has been a considerable waste of time and effort. I would urge the government to read very closely the outcomes and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the roundtables: that was not the sense that I had of the attitude at those roundtables. In fact, it was very interesting to be present at the time when people publicly acknowledged it is time for a cultural shift in funding of our public hospitals. It is no longer any good for the states to say, `The Commonwealth is not giving us enough,' and the Commonwealth to say, `The states do not give enough.' That is past, and everybody at the roundtables was looking for solutions to how it might be better done in the future. There is a considerable sympathy and support for the notion of pooled funding or a single fund of contributions from the Commonwealth and the state, to be set out and stated from both sides, Commonwealth and state. This is seen as allowing flexibility and doing away with opportunity for cost shifting and blame shifting. Let us move on: let us find better ways to fund our public hospitals.</para><para>The government report in opposition to the opposition's report suggests that a lot of these things are state issues. But one of the main concerns our inquiry had to deal with was: how do you get adequate accounting of Commonwealth dollar expenditure when it is down to the states to provide the adequate data? This is not a matter of: `It's a state issue; we shouldn't be concerned about it.' It is important for the Commonwealth and states to agree to exchange of data and agree to moving on with the issues raised in the inquiry. The government's minority report seems to make the case for not moving forward, and I think that would be a disappointing outcome from an inquiry which, as I say, was non-partisan and recommended significant improvement and ways forward. I acknowledge Senator Lees's and the Democrats' contribution, which appreciates that it is time to move forward and it is time for us to have to look at different ways of doing things. The Democrats have in large part supported what the opposition senators have said but also suggest that, instead of waiting until the next health care agreements or perhaps a change of government, there are ways in which we could experiment with pool funding in a local or regional area. Some of us and some of the witnesses have concerns about that, because it may move away from the national equity and access emphasis of Medicare in the provision of our public hospital and public health services, but I certainly think it is interesting to note Senator Lees's contribution and her support for the principal recommendations of this report.</para><para>In summary, what has emerged is a very strong desire for change from all of those people I listed, because of the participants' concern about the ability of our public hospitals to continue to meet the demands made upon them if the current arrangements and the current funding continue indefinitely. We need to have an urgent increase in funding to address the desperate shortage of resources; an end to the divided funding of health programs and the beginning of a new intergovernmental era of agreement between the two levels of government; a move to much more open reporting of funding and performance against national standards; and a new focus on the quality of health and the importance of information technology in both the running of hospitals and the management of patient health care. Both of those are still lagging behind in Australia, and need to be increased.  </para><para>Finally, there is a lot of discussion in this report about the impact of private health insurance and the increased uptake of private health insurance. It is important to note that there is no evidence that that does anything to reduce the demand on public hospitals. The large number of people who are taking out private health insurance are young, healthy people who never use public hospitals and will not be a demand on them. This will not therefore relieve demand on the public hospitals. Importantly, many people have front-end deductibles arrangements for private health; under Medicare they are of course entitled to use the public hospital system, and many have chosen to do so.

I am particularly disappointed in the opposition's report. After a very lengthy reference to the committee that was based on Labor Party press releases about the terms of reference, it was disappointing to see that the commitment that was given to the committee at the commencement of this inquiry—that it would be completely apolitical and it would actually look for solutions—has resulted in a report that is anything but apolitical and is totally and utterly biased. But, worse than that, after 12 months it has in fact ignored what could be done to improve the system of health in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Mystifyingly, Senator Crowley has simply dismissed the claims in the government members' minority report that there are many things that are outside the jurisdiction of this committee to assess. For the life of me, I cannot understand why she would do that, given the fact that on page 186, where we list the details that are already in the recommendations vis-à-vis what is already in place, there are six recommendations that the opposition have made that are already a matter of public policy. There are 16 that are clearly a responsibility of the states and eight that are seeking to create an additional bureaucracy. Anyone in their right mind, after 12 months of inquiry, would not want to put down that many areas of discussion that are already public policy, that many that are not the responsibility of the Commonwealth—after all, this is the federal parliament—and then put a request that we create another level of bureaucracy, thus using important taxpayers' dollars that will not ultimately end up in the health system. It is just absolutely and utterly preposterous.</para><para>As Senator Crowley just said, there were requests by many of the witnesses that it was time for a cultural shift and that they were looking for solutions to the future. I cannot understand why the opposition did not jolly well put it down. The fact of the matter is that what they have said is that you simply have to throw more money at the hospitals; that is what we have to do. To that I would make a number of comments. First and foremost, if the states had kept pace with their funding and the Commonwealth funding, there would be an extra $460 million, nearly half a billion dollars, going into the hospital system. They have not. That is not a case of finger-pointing both ways; that is simply a case of reality. It they had kept pace, that is what would have happened—and it is disappointing to see states like Tasmania and South Australia ripping money out when the Commonwealth puts money in. That should be deplored. There is one recommendation we would make, and that is that we should make sure that future agreements are signed and sealed on the basis that the Commonwealth increases the level of funding but so do the states, and that the states give a commitment that they will not take money out based on the level of funding increase the Commonwealth has put in.</para><para>I would have thought that the opposition, with any prospect of being in government one day—heaven help the country—might have agreed to that, but they have not. I do not know why not. Also, they seem to focus on the fact that it is an ageing population that is creating a problem in our hospitals and the demand on hospitals. It is not just a case of an ageing population; it is a case of dealing with chronic illness. There is not one recommendation in the opposition's umpteen-million pages of report that actually deals with chronic illness and how best a government can assist the states and vice versa. Admittedly, this would require a new level of cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth that has not been seen previously. Nonetheless, it would ensure the shift to making the treatment of chronic illness a priority, because there are trials both in Australia and overseas that have clearly demonstrated that such a shift in focus would result in a 10 per cent decrease in demand on public hospitals. After 12 months, why on earth have the opposition not been able to focus on such simple issues as that? It is important also to make sure that the level of cooperation between the governments is improved, because there has been too much finger-pointing and I think that we have to make sure that in future the states do give unequivocal commitments. </para><para>Senator Crowley has just made the comment that the increase in participation rates of private health insurance has not shown any decrease in the utilisation of public hospitals. Heavens above, these measures have not been in place all that long. Does she want to see a shift immediately? The opposition were in government for 13 years and ran down the participation rates of private health insurance from around 70 per cent to under 30 per cent. This government has sought to increase those levels of participation, which over time would make sure that there are more people being put into the private hospital system, away from the public hospital system, thereby freeing up the public hospitals for those who are in genuine need and who cannot afford private health insurance. But here we go, with the opposition seeing this as an opportunity to kick the private system yet again. Interestingly enough, Ms Macklin, who is now the shadow minister for health in the other place, concluded in 1991, before she was in this place, in an issues paper that she was involved in:</para><quote><para>Data analysed in this paper provides support for the view that the private sector is, on balance, more efficient than the public sector.</para></quote><para>That was her view then and she has not indicated that there has been a change of view. But, having listened to Senator Crowley today, I am a bit concerned that in fact the 30 per cent rebate that I thought the opposition had signed on to for private health insurance may not now be policy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Maybe it might be in roll-back.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—Yes, it might be part of the roll-back, Senator Campbell. That is a great worry because many people have taken out private health insurance, and I think it is interesting that Senator Crowley has now put a question mark over that again. I think that the people of Australia should know that her comments today put that 30 per cent rebate in jeopardy and that clearly the opposition are now considering scrapping that.

It is important they know that this is where the Labor Party are heading in such important areas of policy, because they have no solutions to this area. They have no solutions to public hospital funding. All they say is, `Let's pool the money. Let's put all the money from the Commonwealth and states together in one big pot and then let's decide how to do it.' But they just don't focus on the issues. There was another recommendation that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare, community health services and aged care should all be wrapped into an area where the states have some say. How on earth can you come up with that solution? The PBS and Medicare are completely Commonwealth, and why would you want the states involved in that? It is not possible. The Labor Party did not do it. It is not possible, because that is the domain of the Commonwealth. </para></talk.start></continue><para>When we look at so many of these recommendations—unfortunately, time does not permit a closer scrutiny here today—they are simply and utterly impractical and unworkable. For a majority opposition committee report to come down with so many recommendations that are already a matter of public policy, are within the province of the states or are just creating another layer of bureaucracy is nothing short of a disgrace, after all of this time. It was a real opportunity for a committee to work in a non-partisan fashion to come up with solutions. It is not a case of closing the door and saying there are not better ways to do it. The Minister for Health and Aged Care recognises there are better ways, such as the management of chronic illness, such as making sure the states contribute equally and do not take money out of the system, and many more issues. Why could the opposition not focus on that instead of just trying to be political? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>21036</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the interests of ensuring that today's very tight schedule proceeds smoothly, I shall limit my comments to a minimum and shall at the end of the time allocated for considering the committee's report seek leave to continue my remarks another day.

Some people would say that the situation surrounding the <inline ref="R1128">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000</inline> has become farcical. Certainly the statements and behaviour of the government might lead one to that conclusion. Labor does not regard this matter as one to be laughed about. It is one of the most serious issues that I, for one, have faced in my political career. Its implications are enormous. The potential effects of the government's new SES funding model are so unjust, so unfair and so inequitable that Labor has consistently sought to persuade this government through all possible means to listen seriously to the overwhelming and unanimous public opposition to this issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Late on Tuesday night Dr Kemp once again tried in vain to blame the Labor Party for the impasse over the schools funding bill. But, Minister, that just will not stick. No-one believes him. The government is behaving with disgraceful intransigence. It has refused to listen and it will not amend its flawed and unfair legislation, no matter how many times requests are made of it by the Senate to do so, no matter what arguments are put forward and no matter who calls for this to happen. For example, there are the publicly expressed views of the Anglican Bishop of Grafton, the Right Reverend Philip Huggins, who has called on the government to withdraw its inequitable funding proposals for non-government schools. He says the bill is `unnecessarily divisive'. He asks whether Dr Kemp will persist stubbornly with this new policy until commonsense prevails. Another example is Father Nic Frances, the head of the respected Anglican charity the Brotherhood of St Laurence, who has publicly described the policy in similar terms.</para><para>In the evidence before the Senate committee of inquiry into the bill, the Reverend Tom Doyle, the deputy chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, the one so often quoted by Dr Kemp as being supportive of this new model, said that the NCEC:</para><quote><para>... had argued consistently that a combination of measures of need should be used. These included the current capital resources, the geographical spread, the necessity to provide a wide range of central services and the socioeconomic status of the population served by the schools. </para></quote><para>Father Doyle is not as unequivocally enthusiastic about the new funding measure as Dr Kemp would have us believe. He thinks the model is one dimensional and that it does not adequately measure the resources available to schools. It is not only the lonely voice of the opposition, as the minister would put it, but many voices.

The Speaker, in his wisdom, believes that pressing a request on behalf of the Senate is not on. He thinks it is not on because it has not happened at this level since 1906. He thinks it cannot be done because the House, he says, has never accepted that it could be done. I really must ask what sort of advice the Speaker is getting. I think it is reasonable to point out that the reason the Senate has not repeatedly made requests since 1906 is that since that time pressed requests have been acceded to. Further, I am advised by the Clerk of the Senate that, on that occasion in 1906, the government acceded to the request pressed on the second occasion. </para><para>The Speaker says that this issue is not dealt with in the standing orders. He seems to forget that the House is within its rights to suspend its own standing orders. He mutters darkly about double dissolutions. He makes a quaint distinction between the pressing of requests and the pressing of amendments. Basically, he does nothing to advance the debate either in the substance or in the process. If I look at the minister's remarks—and there we do see a true constitutional giant—he says that the opposition has precious little respect for the Constitution of this country. This is a particularly interesting concept coming, as my colleague in the House Mr Lee pointed out, from a party that caused the constitutional crisis of 1975 when the Liberal Party refused to allow supply, thus threatening to bring the entire machinery of the Commonwealth government to a grinding halt.</para><para>I am intrigued by the view coming from Liberal Party representatives in the House of Representatives about the Senate's right to press requests. My advice is that, during the period of the Labor government, the same principles were not applied. In fact, on five occasions the Liberal Party initiated requests which were pressed in this chamber. For example, on the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Levy Amendment Bill 1985, the Veterans' Entitlements Bill 1985 and, oh dear, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1988, requests were made and those requests were pressed. I am reminded by the Clerk that the issue there was requested amendments and reinstated establishment grants for non-government schools in 1989. Minister, that is a bit awkward, given the claims made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in the House of Representatives. There were also the wool tax bills Nos 1 to 5 in 1991 and the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994—another education bill. With the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994, the Senate pressed requests and the bill was later signed. So I do not think the government is on strong constitutional grounds here.</para><para>The hypocrisy of the Liberal Party when it comes to the Constitution knows no bounds. They are the party of 1975. The Labor Party do not behave in that way. The Labor Party would never do that; we have made that clear. On this occasion we are talking about a $22 billion bill for 10,000 schools, for 3.2 million students. When the Liberal Party talked about these constitutional issues in 1975, they were holding the entire country to ransom. In my judgment, it is the government that is seeking to blackmail and to hold to ransom the children of this country. The requests that we have made simply seek to transfer a proportion of the $22 billion from the wealthiest schools in this country to students with disabilities, who, many would argue, are the most in need—that is, a transfer from those who have the most to give to those most in need. This is about priorities. This is a test which this government has failed. </para><para>It strikes me that, if we consider the fulminations of the Speaker and the ravings of the minister, they have essentially missed the point. They have missed the point of the simple proposition about the needs of Australian children. I asked Mr Evans, the Clerk, to give me some advice on these questions, and he pointed out to me:</para><quote><para>The Constitution and the Senate standing orders place no limitations on the number of occasions on which the Senate can repeat a request. The House of Representatives has a standing order to the effect that, while the Senate insists on an amendment for a second time, the House will lay the bill aside or request a conference between the houses. It is not clear that this standing order applies to repeated requests by the Senate, but, in any event, the House can suspend its standing orders if it wishes to consider repeated requests, so there is therefore nothing to prevent the Senate repeating and the House reconsidering a request for an amendment on any number of occasions.</para></quote><para>The clear and concise words of the Clerk need no paraphrasing, and in theory we can go on doing this forever—at least until the parliament is dissolved. We have said that this bill is obscene. It is blatantly inequitable. It is a disgusting and arrogant display of the politics of privilege and greed. It assumes that the average Australian is prepared to subsidise the lavish education and the luxurious school facilities available in the wealthiest schools, where the amount available per student is three times the amount we see fit to spend on kids in government schools. </para><para>Dr Kemp accuses the Labor Party of whipping up class hatred. Of course, we would expect nothing less from him. This bill in its cold, dispassionate display of blatant featherbedding for the richer schools is what whips up class hatred as cleanly as anything else could possibly do. The government cannot hide behind its spurious obfuscation about the procedures and standing orders. It cannot issue hollow threats about constitutional crises and double dissolutions. Only one thing is needed to resolve the impasse, and that is for the government to accept our requests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>21040</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make some final comments on this bill today.

As I sat there this morning and I heard many people talk about fairness, equity and a fair go for Aboriginal Australians in this country, I realised how hypocritical this government really is in the kinds of bills that it presents to this parliament. I thought of last Sunday when the Treasurer and some of his colleagues attempted, with two feet and a heartbeat, to walk along the streets of Melbourne purporting to support reconciliation. I thought of how courageous it was of them to do that but how very empty their words were.</para><para>We hear members of this government talking about a new catchphrase which they have designed: `practical reconciliation', they now tell this country. `We do not need to apologise. We do not need to embrace all of these documents that are being produced in order to drive this agenda forward. We do it in a practical way. We have practical reconciliation. We have embraced that term and cuddled it as if it is the best thing since sliced bread.' But here we are in the parliament today, considering for the last time—because this is the third time it has come back to the Senate—a bill which will give millions of dollars to the wealthiest schools in this country, at the expense of indigenous Australians, particularly the people I represent in the Northern Territory. Under this bill, on average $4,000 a head is spent on kids in public schools around this country.</para><para>As I said in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill, in some communities in the Northern Territory there is no secondary school—no bricks and mortar. There are communities of over 2,000 people, with 500 children in the primary school who have no opportunity to do schooling past year 7. Yet millions of dollars will be going to schools like Wesley College, Geelong Grammar and the King's School in Sydney, which do not need this money. Let us be honest about it: they do not need this additional funding—not while we have Aboriginal children in the northern part of Australia who not only do not have a secondary school and do not have computers in their classrooms; they have classes of 25 and 30 kids with one teacher, just as they do in Woden here in Canberra, but these kids do not speak English as a first language. They should be resourced on a one to five ratio. </para><para>No wonder these kids have the poorest literacy and numeracy rate around the country. No wonder these children will struggle all of their lives to attain the same level of education that your children and my children will attain by the time they get to grade 3. Yet the federal government is prepared to put this bill, which ignores that fact, before the parliament again. They say, `We fund indigenous education over and above the normal mainstream through IESIP, through targeted programs.' When you put it side by side with what is going to happen to category 1 schools, it is not enough. Why can that money not be channelled to the neediest kids in this country, to those kids who are disabled or to our indigenous children who will struggle for many years? In their wildest dreams, they will never be able to achieve the level that students at elite, private and wealthy schools will be able to achieve.  </para><para>Indigenous children step out of those communities and go to places like Darwin, Alice Springs and capital cities on the eastern seaboard and step into another world, into a chasm, which some members of this federal government fail to understand. I believe they long to have a decent and proper education. They would want a computer at each of their desks. They would want not only a library in their school but a properly resourced library. They would like to have teachers on a one to five ratio, as they try to learn the same concepts which we teach our kids in primary schools but in a second language. They are trying to learn literacy skills which are unknown to their culture in a second language, but we treat them as if English is their first language. We put them in classrooms of 25. We give them first-year-out teachers who have little experience, let alone cultural knowledge and an ability to adapt to remote communities in the bush.</para><para>So on a day when this government accepts this document <inline font-style="italic">Reconciliation Australia's  challenge</inline>, no doubt in question time, as a dorothy dixer from across the chamber is asked of Senator Herron, we will hear the words `practical reconciliation'. That is what this government does. `That's what we do. We don't have to speak these words to Aboriginal people. We do it practically.' Yet this morning we are going to see this bill in this parliament which allocates millions of dollars to kids in the wealthiest schools and ignores indigenous children in northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory. That is not a sign of practical reconciliation; that is the government turning their backs on the future of indigenous children in this country. I cannot believe that the people in DETYA and this minister can put their hand on their heart and say to the people of this country, `This bill is fair. This bill delivers equity in distributing the education dollar,' because it does not. A close scrutiny of where the money goes, even a cursory glance at what is happening in this bill, will prove to every single person in this country that this bill is far from fair. It is not equitable.</para><para>We do not have a level playing field in this country from which we can resource people from here on in. This bill will advance the wealthy. It will advance people who least need this money to assist their education. This bill will continue to ignore the disadvantaged circumstances that indigenous children in this country endure on a day-to-day basis when it comes to trying to resource their education. In the 2½ years I have been in the Senate, this is the worst bill I have had to deal with. It is a disgrace. It is not an example of practical reconciliation, and don't anyone believe that as they hear these words coming from this government in the next 24 hours.</para><para>You cannot say that we have practical reconciliation with Aboriginal people on the very same day that you are going to endorse a bill that gives millions of dollars to 21 or 29 of the wealthiest schools in this country. I have communities in the Northern Territory—at Kintore, Numbulwar, Ngukurr, Maningrida and Port Keats; you could roll them off, 190 or so of them—that are struggling to maintain teachers, to have well qualified teachers, to have the resources they need and to have the technology they need to be able to teach their kids properly in the 21st century, while this bill is still being pushed by this federal government. It is a disgrace and it is an embarrassment. We will make something of this in the course of the next 12 months—my oath. It will be something that I will push in every Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory to highlight to them the disregard that this government has for their attempts to properly resource their children's education and their children's future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21042</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to hear those contributions from Senator Carr and Senator Crossin. I hope we can look forward to Labor maintaining its line and insisting on those amendments and requests. As has been properly pointed out today, this is not a matter of the Senate blocking the bill; it is a matter of the Senate simply insisting on its amendments. It is up to the government to decide whether the bill is blocked or not. As I have said many times in this debate, they are not ideal amendments but they are at least important in knocking off the worst aspects of this bill which, as we know, delivers huge gains to private schools. I do not want to canvass all of those arguments again but, as I looked back through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and checked a few of the statistics, reports and so on, there are some things that I wanted to raise with the minister about his remarks throughout the debate. I also think it is worth commenting on the comments of the Speaker in the House of Representatives in the last couple of days concerning requests. I want to put on the record exactly what section 53 of the Constitution says. It provides that the Senate may, at any stage, return a bill to the House of Representatives with requests.</para></talk.start><para>Even if `at any stage' it is interpreted as meaning `at any stage in the Senate's initial consideration of the bill', as has been suggested, as an argument against pressing the request, the Senate could press a request many times by reiterating it at each stage of the consideration of the bill. Even if the Senate was not able to press the same request, it could easily circumvent a restriction, if that was its intention, by slightly modifying the request each time it put it. As the Senate Clerk, Mr Evans, has advised us, there is no suggestion that the framers of our Constitution intended that requests should not be pressed more than once. It is quite clear that, in this place, we are entitled to do that as many times as is necessary. I think it is important to get that on the record. That advice is available to all senators, no doubt, who would like to see it.</para><para>I wanted to pick up on something Minister Ellison said in the last debate, and that was that the state governments were in favour of this legislation. We all heard that; some of us were open-mouthed in hearing it. I went back and had a look at some of the correspondence that has been received on this question from the states. One that I want to concentrate on today is that from the Queensland state government. There certainly was not unanimous support for this legislation in any quarter, even from the private school sector. The government cannot claim that there is unanimous support here. The Catholics have opted out. I have had many letters and phone calls from schools that are very hard done by in this legislation and they certainly do not support it in its current form. The Queensland state government said that they did welcome more funding going into non-government schools—we might agree to disagree with that—but that is about where their support stops for this bill. It is my understanding that Queensland drew the Prime Minister's attention to the decline in funding to government schools as a proportion of funds provided to all schools, pointing out that it is a drop from 32.5 per cent in 1997 to 28.8 per cent in 2004. They offered the view that this was of great concern. The minister also said, in this place, that the state ministers had accepted the EBA as a fair enough kind of measure. Again, as I understand it, the Premier of Queensland said:</para><quote><para>The EBA is a crude policy instrument that penalises Queensland government schools even though their enrolments are increasing by more than enrolments in non-government schools. For example, between 1996-1999, enrolments in Queensland government schools increased by 15,512 and enrolments in non-government schools increased by 14,752. Despite this, Queensland lost $5.4 million in 1999-2000 and is projected to lose $7.7 million in 2000-2001.</para></quote><para>I think that even if the minister did not mislead this place, certainly his suggestion that state governments were in favour of maintaining the EBA is false. I certainly know that other states have complained about it on numerous occasions. The Queensland correspondence also says:</para><quote><para>This bill represents a shift in the balance of Commonwealth funding away from government and towards non-government schools. This shift represents a fundamental change in the partnership between the Commonwealth and states which has been a cornerstone of education funding policy since the mid-1960s. </para></quote><para>They also drew attention to the disadvantage for people who rely on government education who are living in rural and remote areas and for parents of children who have special needs.</para><para>Another matter the Queensland government raised was the fact that there will be numerous instances under the new SES model in which non-government schools in Queensland will receive more total government funding—that is, Commonwealth and state—per student than neighbouring state schools. I would like a response from the minister to that. I would like to know whether the government has checked out those figures that were produced by Queensland, and validated, I understand, by PricewaterhouseCoopers. If this is the case, as Queensland believes it is, we have a very serious situation indeed on our hands.</para><para>A case in point is an independent secondary school in the Brisbane region which will receive total government funding of $5,651 per student in 2004. A neighbouring state high school will receive just $4,996 per student in the same year, and that includes a share of central overhead costs; so it is not simply coming from the global budget of the school. They say that there are many similar examples throughout Queensland. I think this raises the question of how a state secondary school can possibly offer their students all of the resources necessary to deliver a good education on $4,996 a head. Parents know that is not enough money. That is why more and more of them are prepared to pay extra so that their child can be in a school which is better funded. Many schools charge fees of more than twice that amount. Of course, many schools have those fees topped up by fundraising, which can be very substantial, and each school receives Commonwealth and state grants. State schools can, of course, fundraise—and many of them do—but many of them are unable to fundraise to anything like the extent that even some government schools in better-off suburbs can. Many of them certainly do not have anything like the opportunities available to non-government schools, many of which are getting a huge handout from this bill. </para><para>The other issue is that there are limits on fees and levies which can be paid to these schools. In most states the state government sets a limit—and quite rightly. We should not be seeing user-pays come into our public education—I am not advocating that. I am pointing out that the parents in those schools do not have any opportunity, except through fundraising, to raise the amount of money spent on each student in that school. If they see that the school is hopelessly underresourced—as most state schools are—their only option is to take their children out of that school and send them to a private school—and I think this goes to the crux of this whole question and this bill. The result is that the private sector can confer serious advantage to their students at the expense of government schools. </para><para>The Queensland Premier says that the result of the bill will be that parents who do not choose the non-government option or cannot afford to do so will be left with a degraded, poorly funded public education sector. The Queensland state government has pointed out that this measure is about making more money available to be spent on those advantaged students, as there is no requirement for the schools to reduce their fees. The government's claim is that this measure will make choice a reality for more parents, and clearly that is hogwash. As I said in my last contribution to this debate, we have seen Canberra Grammar School, which receives more then $1 million from this measure, advertising for a person to promote the school. We are not going to see any school reduce their fees as a result of this measure. I think Wesley said they might reduce it by $200 per student, but that is a fraction of what they will receive from this bill per student.</para><para>As I understand it, Queensland are also not happy with some aspects of the accountability arrangements that are proposed in the bill. They point out that, through MCEETYA, the states have already agreed to a set of national goals for schooling and are finalising a series of performance measures and targets, and they see no reason to provide the Commonwealth minister with the ability to short-cut this process. Queensland also complained about the consultation on this bill. Only two weeks ago they said that it would have been appropriate to discuss the bill at MCEETYA or at COAG. Maybe discussions have taken place in the last two weeks with each of the state ministers—I do not know. Perhaps the minister can advise us on that. But to come into this chamber and suggest that the states are now ticking off this bill is grossly wrong. Dr Kemp often justifies this bill on the basis that: </para><quote><para>... the socioeconomic profile of non-government school parents is today very similar to that of government school parents.</para></quote><para>That is a quote from a recent document that was distributed from Dr Kemp's office. Again, that can be quite solidly refuted. </para><para>This year, Barbara Preston looked at the data in relation to the type of school attended and seven parental income brackets. That data illustrated that:</para><para>·	the wealthier the family, the more likely it is that the children will attend private school;</para><para>·	in the secondary years it is approximately 2½ times more likely that the children of the highest income bracket will attend private schools than those in the lowest;</para><para>·	in primary school there is roughly double the possibility;</para><para>·	the difference is not confined to the extremes. The positive relationship between income bracket and the type of school attended is clear across all brackets.</para><para>I wanted to get that on the record because we have heard so much about choice and how parents are struggling—and indeed they are. I make no claim that they do not struggle. I know a lot of parents who sacrifice a great deal in financial terms in order to send their children to non-government schools, and I do not deny them that right. But this bill is about something else. This bill is about rewarding those schools which draw from communities which are very well placed to pay very high fees. Again, I want to draw attention to the differences between those schools that will benefit so hugely from this bill and government public schools. In some ways, I guess this legislation has been useful to us in drawing attention to those huge differences. </para><para>There is a huge public outcry about this legislation. I hope it is felt by the government at the next election. I hope the fury that I am hearing about is reflected. I hope that Labor takes this opportunity to take advantage of that fury instead of giving in—and I was very heartened to hear what Senator Carr said today. Again I advise that the Democrats will insist on these amendments and the requests because we think they are the least that this place can do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>21044</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is crunch time as far as this education legislation is concerned.

I agree with previous speakers that this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we could see in this place, because not only does it distribute 65 per cent of the money to private schools, which have some 30 per cent of the students, but also, when you look at it in the reverse, it distributes only 35 per cent to the public school system, which has the big majority of students in this country. The philosophy and the drive of this government indicate that this change in direction will go a lot further. While the Labor Party might feel that it will go to the next election campaigning on this matter and will pick up votes on it, I think we have to be sanguine enough to say, `We don't know what's going to happen at the next election.' It may well be that the Howard government will be returned and, when and if that happens, things will get worse still. The imbalance between the wealthy and the poor in this country will grow, and with that we will see an accelerated imbalance between the wealthy and the poorer schools in the country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—That is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Ferris says that is not true.

You cannot deny what is in front of us on our desks at the moment, which shows that there is a massive spending boost to already wealthy schools at the expense of the public school system in Australia. I as a Green am not going to stand for that. I am not going to demur at this confrontation with the government. I am not going to allow myself to be found voting for this wretched piece of legislation that sets its face against the public school system in Australia. I would remind senators that this legislation would be unconstitutional in the United States, where the government is not allowed to put money into private school coffers at all. What we are seeing here is an historic destruction of the public school system at the expense of the privileged private school system. We are seeing a loss of that dictum that says: `Every child in this country should have an equal right to an equal quality education.' The minute you depart from that you enter the field of discrimination. This legislation is high discrimination against millions of Australian students. Senator Crossin very eloquently pointed to those who are in the most disadvantaged sector of our community, the first Australians themselves. I can tell you that this legislation is going to do nothing to try to close the gap, the disadvantage, for indigenous people and indeed other people who do not have adequate facilities in the 21st century. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Carr said, `We have sought to persuade this government through all possible means.' But I think that in brackets after that comes, `Sadly we must now capitulate.' Senator Carr said, `We are calling on the government to change its position; even now it is not too late.' But in 10 or 20 minutes or half an hour from now, we will see whether it is too late. That will be demonstrated to us by who is on which side of this chamber standing up for the public education system and making sure that the Senate does use its powers to get a fair deal for public education in this country. The Labor opposition says that the government is seeking to blackmail and hold to ransom the students of this country. Well, who of us on this side or on the crossbenches wants to be party to legislation from a government that blackmails and holds to ransom the students of this country? We are about to find out. I would say to the opposition, `Don't you be a party to that. You have described it exactly but don't you be party to it, because going to the government side in this matter, in being faced down by the House of Representatives, is to do just that.'</para><para>The opposition says that the government cannot hide behind threats of a constitutional crisis. We are nowhere near a constitutional crisis on this matter. As Senator Allison pointed out, we are within the constitutional right and established powers of the Senate in this matter. It is important that, where the government is doing the wrong thing by the nation and its education system, the Senate exercise that right and that power. Let me say to all senators that the government needs to be tackled on this matter; it needs to be confronted on the matter. There is no doubt that funding for the school system will continue. That is the responsibility of the government. We are talking about some tens of millions of dollars being redistributed through requests made by the Senate. We are not talking about not funding the school system; we are talking about a minimal redistribution to the public school system, to those most in need.</para><para>It is a minimal stand that the Senate is taking. It is not an ambit claim. It is not dictating to government, `You must abandon your philosophy,' repugnant as that philosophy may be. It is simply saying that we have to hone back the cutting of the funding to the Australian public school system. Even at this eleventh hour, I say to the Labor Party: stand on your principle, stand by your own position. Stand up to this government, and the Australian electorate will thank you for it. The Australian electorate does not want the government to get away with this legislation. After all, it affects so many of the children of this nation—the next generation of this nation.

Senator Brown has an unerring ear for the dramatic. I do not mean that as a criticism, because quite clearly this legislation before the chamber is an important and defining piece of legislation for Australia. </para></talk.start><para>There is absolutely no doubt that education is the most fundamental of all issues for developed and developing countries. Access to educational opportunity for all is what defines a fair country from a country that lacks fairness. It is also true that the Australian Labor Party in government has been a party committed to the principles of equal opportunity, fairness and the right of every younger person in Australia to have access to the best education that can be possibly provided. That is the only way for the true talents of Australians to be properly tapped and for the true creativity of this nation to reach its natural optimum. It is the only way to give ordinary Australians a chance to learn the skills and to obtain the qualifications they need to be a useful person in society and to understand what is happening in the wider world.</para><para>It is right to emphasise with some drama the importance of this legislation. It is right to point to the perfidy of this government because of this legislation. In 1996, 43 per cent of funding went to government schools. In 2004, as a consequence of this bill, 34 per cent of funding will go to government schools, which is an actual reduction. Just as education was one of the key issues in the still disputed United States election—with the rivals, Bush and Gore, trying to outspend one another—in Australia the government is reducing the amount of expenditure as a percentage of total outlays.</para><para>As countries within our region aspire to lift their economic standards through education in real terms, Australia has a government which in real terms is cutting back. We have a government in Australia that is shifting educational opportunity from all to just the wealthy.

So it is right to condemn this government.</para><para>I do not accept the definition applied to the Labor Party by the Greens. It is true that this is a dramatic piece of legislation, and it is true the government should be rightly condemned for its perfidy and for its attempt to turn back the clock to the 19th century by rewarding wealth and privilege over the right of all, but this legislation will be an election issue.

If this is going to be one of the defining issues at the next election, will the minor parties join the Labor Party in defeating the Liberal-National coalition, or will they not? That is a key question here. It is all right to make a proselytising speech in this chamber, but when you are called out and have to front up for your convictions, as you do in an election, where you put your preferences and which of the two major parties you prefer for government is what you mean by what you say. So the challenge goes back the other way. If your convictions are real, do not judge people by their speeches—judge them by their actions.

The House of Representatives returns the bill and transmits to the Senate the following resolution which was agreed to by the House of Representatives on this day. I would like to focus on item (d) because it goes to the essence of the debate we are having today. In this item the House of Representatives:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(d) calls on the Senate to agree to the Bill as transmitted to it by the House of Representatives without requests, amendments or further delay.</para></quote><para>So we have the government, through the House of Representatives, calling on the Senate to actually disregard all of the input of the senators whose responsibility it is to represent their states. I emphasise the latter. It is the prerogative of the House of Representatives to put forward legislation but it is the responsibility of the senators in this place to view that legislation based on their representation of their state. The essence of the bill is that it will appropriate additional funding to schools. I remind the Senate that approximately 70 per cent of the students in Australia attend government schools. I, like other senators, have received overwhelming correspondence in regard to this issue. I would like to quote a letter from the Monto State School Parents and Citizens Association in Queensland: </para><quote><para>I am writing on behalf of the Monto State School Parents &amp; Citizens Association.  Monto is a rural community approximately two hours drive west of Bundaberg in Queensland. There are presently 215 students enrolled at the school from 129 families.  Concern has been expressed at the Bill presently before the Senate relating to the funding for schools, in particular the amount apportioned to Private Schools.</para><para>Last year we were the victims of Government cut backs—</para></quote><para>to clarify, they are referring to the Queensland Labor government—</para><quote><para>when our Groundsman's hours were slashed in half to 22 hours per week. We made representations to The Queensland Education Department and various politicians without success. The cut in hours came about due to a ridiculous mathematical formula revolving around the number of students at the school. The student number has increased this year but the Groundsman did not get his hours back. The school grounds remain the same size and require the same amount of maintenance but there is only so much one man can do with 22 hours.</para><para>Now we see this Bill, which will give Private Schools a great deal more funds than Government funded schools.  Why? There is a great deal of anger in the Monto community over this Bill. On the evening news on Sunday 19 November the matter of funds for Kings College was broadcast. To see a Private School being given $1,000,000.00 to upgrade their oval made no sense, considering we are not able to have the funds to have a full time groundsman. One million dollars would keep him employed for quite a while. </para></quote><para>Further in the correspondence:  </para><quote><para>Contained in the correspondence I received from the Queensland Council of Parents &amp; Citizens Association Inc is the following passage which relates to the legislation changes, "The net result of the new funding model is that 61 category 1 schools, the wealthiest category, out of 2,620 non-government schools will receive an extra $57 million per year.</para></quote><para>This is an average gain of $900,000 for those 61 category 1 schools. The letter goes on to say:</para><quote><para>This is an average gain of $900,000.  In fact, 70% of non-government schools across Australia will receive no extra funding at all. 54 of the 61 category 1 schools are in Sydney or Melbourne." The meaning of this is quite clear. There is no equity in the new legislation and it reeks of favouritism.</para></quote><para>That is quoting from one of the many hundreds of pieces of correspondence that I have received in relation to this bill. Overwhelmingly, the correspondence that I have received does not call for amendments to the bill; it calls for the bill to be opposed. I believe it is incumbent on the Queensland senators to listen to that overwhelming message that has been coming from the government schools. I have received two pieces of correspondence in support of the bill—two in support and hundreds against. In light of that response from the people of Queensland, I will be opposing the message from the House of Representatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>21048</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond to Senator Cook.

I have said to my party in Tasmania: how can we give preferences to a Labor Party which wants to drive the chainsaws into the tall forests faster than a coalition? The nationwide message that comes out of today, ifLabor is seen to be voting with the Liberals on the other side of this chamber, is: what is the difference between the two?

But I reiterate: the crunch time is here and the opposition should stand firm on this matter. I have no doubt it will be resolved before the end of the year. I point out that the requests ask less than the amendments coming next. They are very modest requests for some remediation of the most repugnant part of this legislation to divert some money into the most needy sectors of the public school system. The opposition should stand on those requests, with other parties in this place, or the electorate will see that and we will have to take that into account as we go to the next election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>21048</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown ought to know that his choices and his party's choices at the next election are quite limited.

We will see how you vote at the next election, like us all. Minister, I think our position has been spelt out perfectly clearly: nothing matters more than the education of our children. It is at school that children develop, discover and become adults. It is at school that children learn about the world and theirplace in it. They learn in many other places as well but school is central to that learning process. They learn with their families and with their friends. They learn through the media. They learn through a whole range of avenues. But school is the central socialising process. Schooling is central to children's lives. I would suggest that the policies that underpin schooling shape that experience. That is why this bill is so important. How we educate our children in school both reflects and reproduces the sort of society that we are. There are a number of former teachers in this chamber. I do not think I would take long to persuade them that schooling has the potential to transform society and certainly to profoundly change the life chances for individuals.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>Australia's children are a collective responsibility for us all in our roles as legislators, in terms of our funding to teachers, and of course as parents and citizens and taxpayers. This Senate has to understand that our country's future and the legacy that we leave behind will be determined by the actions that we take on bills like this and on the policies that government pursues in regard to schooling. Labor's commitment has been clearly spelled out—our commitment to  universal, comprehensive public education is central to our platform and informs all about our policy development. That priority is expressed in the phrase `the knowledge nation'. The knowledge nation idea encapsulates the concept of collectivity, universality, excellence of innovation and quality in education. In school education, which is the site of the acculturation and intellectual development of children as they grow towards adulthood, we must convey to children that we value and respect all equally. That does not mean that we must treat every child the same as every other child. Some children, due to physical or intellectual disability, need additional assistance. Children who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, who do not enjoy the social privileges, are entitled to additional assistance. Some children will need to be encouraged to pursue education much more than others, because at the moment the cultural and social pressures are on them not to do so: I speak of our Aboriginal children. But not just those; working class children in the west of Melbourne, for instance, require additional assistance. This government turns all that on its head. It says: the people that need additional assistance are the wealthiest, the most privileged, the most affluent. In the name of social justice it hands out millions and millions of dollars to the already advantaged. Our specific responsibility as legislators in the Commonwealth is to ensure that all Australian children, wherever they live, whatever their background, have access to schooling that meets adequate community standards.</para><para>That is essentially what the Whitlam government took upon itself when it assumed responsibility for the funding of schools on the basis of need. Thirty years on from the Karmel settlement, as it is known as, it is something that remains for us to all be proud of. It recognised that, whatever kind of school a child attended, we owed them an opportunity for a decent education; that the Commonwealth should recognise that, while the primary responsibility of governments ought to be a strong and vigorous public system, the choices of those who wanted, for example, a Catholic schooling or a Jewish education should also be supported; and that needy schools should be subsidised so that school learning was not at a lower level for those children. Labor's Disadvantaged Schools Program, one of our policies, addressed that problem quite directly. That program was abolished by this government. The aim of this government's policy has been to actually expand the gap, to widen the chasm, between the rich and poor in terms of educational opportunities. On top of that we have seen, through the actions of this government, the resurrection of the ghost of the state aid debate. This government ought to be condemned.</para><para>The bill before the parliament allocates massive windfall gains in Commonwealth moneys to the richest private schools while leaving the many needier non-government schools to basically go without. The bill basically provides nothing in real terms, apart from indexation, for government schools. This is why I say the bill is unfair. It is divisive. The policies are so blatantly unjust that it is obscene. This is why the vast majority of Australians are so angry about what this government has done in schools. This is why this is burning such a hole in the government. I have absolutely no doubt that the empirical advice coming to you, Minister, in terms of your survey results will back up that claim. What this government has done is congratulate itself for stirring up sectarianism, religious bigotry and racial intolerance, all of which have accompanied their schooling policy. It has produced the highest level of prejudice and divisiveness that we have seen in 30 years. That is quite an achievement, Minister. The anger in the electorate, I am absolutely convinced, will be shown at the ballot box. The states grants bill is an example in legislative form of just how flawed the government thinking is in terms of its educational policy. The formula lacks transparency; it lacks clarity; it lacks equity. It is a formula which pretends to be fair but is in fact unjust, inequitable and divisive. The funding formula makes facile and tragically wrong assumptions about the nature of private education in this country. It assumes that the elite, exclusive, wealthy schools that cater for a tiny privileged echelon in the community whose parents can afford the $14,000 a year per child fees are essentially no different from the lowest-fee, most needy, most modest schools in our country. </para><para>As for this formula developed by Professor Farish of the University of Melbourne, Professor Teese made the point that it advantaged what he called `predator' schools. It seems that the professor that drew the scheme up was an epidemiologist. He was not an educationalist; he was from the medical faculty of Melbourne University. Frankly, it is not surprising that the government should find itself in so much trouble over this measure. I do not believe that his expertise and his experience was in the field of education in terms of drawing up these measures. It is not a transparent system.</para><para>The decision to exclude from the model the applications to the Catholic education system and to ensure that its schools are in fact no worse off makes the point of just how ridiculous the system is: it only applies to such a tiny minority of non-government schools. Frankly, the government has a situation where it has now proposed to us that the amendments that we are proposing cannot be accepted. The government has essentially remained intransigent, and it does itself no credit in that process. It has rejected on numerous occasions the request by the Senate. It has frankly refused to discuss the issues and it has sought to avoid its responsibilities, and in doing so has essentially demonstrated its priorities.</para><para>The government says in return that, if the bill is not passed, essentially it is prepared to blackmail the 3.2 million Australians that are dependent upon this funding. Of course, that is not to mention the parents of the 3.2 million Australian students that depend on this money. It says it will block money to Australia's 10,000 schools. It says that the 7,000 government schools, the 1,700 Catholic schools and the other 900 non-government schools will have to do without. It is prepared to hold hostage 3.2 million Australians because the Labor Party has essentially exposed the farce of its funding formula.</para><para>This bill is unfair. It is outrageous. It is repugnant. But the situation is that it is the last day of the parliamentary sitting and the options before the chamber are quite stark. We are not a party that will deny funding to those 3.2 million Australians. We will pursue this issue vigorously. We have made it clear what our position will be in government. We have made it clear what our position will be in the run-up to the next election. We have made it perfectly clear that we will ensure that this bill will be amended when we are in government. The fact of the government's blackmail and of it holding hostage those 3.2 million Australians remains. We cannot allow those children to go without and therefore we are obliged to allow the bill to pass.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21050</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At long last we have the final position from the opposition as to what it is going to do. One thing you can say about the Greens and the Democrats is that they have been very clear on their position. Whilst I do not agree with it, it has been a clear position. But, in relation to the opposition, we had trenchant criticism from Senator Carr despite the fact that the shadow minister for education and the Leader of the Opposition had both said that the opposition would support this bill. Despite that, we have a situation where the government is moving that this request not be pressed, where we would have faced an unprecedented situation if that motion were to fail because the Senate has never advanced that far in pressing a request a third time. So the situation has reached a point where a precedent could have been established where we would have traversed ground not previously covered. </para></talk.start><para>I will just point to some issues which have been raised by senators in speaking against this bill and firstly deal with comments made by Senator Carr. Senator Carr mentioned that in some way there was some qualification from Father Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Commission. On 23 August this year Father Doyle issued a media release in which he stated that:</para><quote><para>The Senate should pass the State Grants Bill 2000 intact ...</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The Bill has the support of the—</para></quote><para>National Catholic Education Commission—</para><quote><para>and the State and Territory Catholic Education Commissions as it recognises that the allocation of funds is based upon need.</para></quote><para>There was also a statement on 17 October this year by Peter Tannock, the Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, that said:</para><quote><para>The NCEC recommends that the Commonwealth Parliament pass the legislation as soon as possible. It is important to remove the uncertainty about the availability of funding for January, 2001.</para></quote><para>That is an essential point, because what the opposition and others have done here is to bring down to the wire the question of funding in relation to a bill which we are all agreed is very important and funding in relation to a question on which we are all agreed is very important, and that is: the provision of a good education to all Australians no matter where they are, no matter what their background and no matter what school they attend. In this bill we have billions of dollars of government funding for both government and non-government schools, funding which can be paid as soon as 1 January 2001, which is just over three weeks away. That is the urgency of the passage of this bill and that is the need for certainty that Dr Tannock mentioned in his release, and to have blocked this bill further, to have delayed it further, would have jeopardised the passage of this bill which related to that enormous amount of funding for education in this country.</para><para>Senator Allison raised a point in relation to education funding in Queensland and put a question to me as to whether the figures had been verified and that in round terms there was funding of $5,000 per student at a government school when the average was $6,000. The government has verified those figures. Indeed, the Prime Minister wrote to Premier Beattie on 3 December this year in relation to funding, and I quote the Prime Minister's letter:</para><quote><para>Based on your own advice, it is clear that the total State funding provided to the government school in question is significantly less than the national and State averages. This raises questions about your Government's commitment to government schools, particularly in the context of the new and growing revenue available to States through A New Tax System. I understand that analysis by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs suggests that in 2000-01 the Commonwealth increased its funding to government schools in Queensland by 4.2 per cent compared to an increase in State funding of 0.8 per cent.</para></quote><para>What the Prime Minister is putting very clearly there to Premier Beattie is that the Commonwealth government had increased funding to government schools by 4.2 per cent, as opposed to the state government, which only increased it by 0.8 per cent. What is more, the Prime Minister pointed to the fact that under the new tax system the states will have the revenue from the GST—revenue they never had before.</para><para>Senator Brown mentioned that, if this bill were in the United States of America, it would be unconstitutional because government moneys cannot go to private schooling in that country. With the greatest of respect to the United States of America, I say that they have their Constitution and we have ours. They have in their Constitution the right to bear arms, and I am sure Senator Brown, coming from Tasmania, would be the first to say that that is not a provision we would welcome in our own Constitution, particularly when one considers the state that Senator Brown comes from. So I think that analogy is not a good one to draw. </para><para>Senator Crossin's criticism of funding for indigenous education and the provision we made for it insofar as this bill is concerned does not recognise the funding that we have provided for in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance)Bill 2000. In that bill we provided, for the quadrennium 2001-04, an appropriation of some $591 million in grants to indigenous education providers in the states and territories. In that bill alone we provided $591 million specifically for indigenous education. That is in addition to what this bill provides in various forms for indigenous education via the funding. Of course, this bill contains total funding of $22 billion. I want to place on record that the government are totally committed to indigenous education. We recognise that there is a great challenge in relation to indigenous education, one which has not been fully met and one which will take a great deal of effort to meet. We are committed to meeting that challenge, and we recognise that across the chamber there is a commitment to indigenous education. But what we think is entirely inappropriate is to turn it into a political football. Let us work together to improve the outcomes in relation to indigenous education in this country.</para><para>There has been comment made about the question of provision of government funding to non-government schools. In a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 6 November this year, Audrey Jackson, the executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia, wrote:</para><quote><para>It is time to stop taking the narrow view, with a focus on the larger, high fee, longer-established schools, and to consider the benefits across the sector. In the SES, the government has developed a method of funding that truly recognises the circumstances of schools in rural and remote Australia.</para></quote><para>What Ms Jackson was referring to there were independent schools in such places as Coolgardie, Carnarvon, Gibson and Mukinbudin, and also those independent schools in the Pilbara, the Kimberley and the Great Sandy Desert. What Ms Jackson went on to say was that these schools will benefit from the implementation of the socioeconomic status model of funding since the maximum funding level has increased to 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost. What she is saying is that these independent schools, dealing with some of the most disadvantaged people in this country—geographically, socially and otherwise—were going to receive more funding as a result of our SES funding model. I think that is a salutary point that is made. I know those areas because they are in my state, and that is why I refer to them. But, of course, this has application across the nation and not just in Western Australia.</para><para>We have now reached the time when we have to realise the seriousness of any delay in the passage of this bill. If the government's motion is defeated, it will jeopardise the passing of the bill. I welcome the comments which I hear from Senator Carr in his closing remarks that the opposition will be supporting the bill. In that regard, we take it that the opposition will be supporting the government's motion that this request not be pressed. If, however, the opposition is minded that it should oppose the government's motion, I foreshadow that we will divide on the question.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>21052</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I apologise for again seeking to make a contribution after the minister has summed up, but I feel obliged to do that because Senator Carr has just dropped a fairly large bombshell on this place and it cannot go unremarked. He says that the ALP are obliged to allow the bill to pass. I think we probably all know in this place that the ALP have known that all along, and in fact they indicated it from the very early stages of this debate. So what we have seen here is a fairly farcical exercise in time wasting. Those of us at this end of the chamber have hoped against hope that the ALP would change their mind, but it has been fairly clear right from the beginning that Mr Lee, the shadow spokesperson for schools, was always going to give in on this bill. I will be asking at the next election all of those people associated with the government and the non-government sector to remember that, because this has been a real waste of time and a great disappointment. </para></talk.start><para>We do not know that we will have an ALP government at the next election, and I think the fact that the ALP have not been prepared to insist on their amendments or on this request is an indication that they are weak in this area of public education and supporting the public sector. I do not think people are going to be persuaded that, just because they hung out for a couple weeks on their amendments, the ALP are likely to do better on public education than even the coalition. I do not think they can bask in the glory of this last couple of weeks of wasted time. It was never going to draw anything out of the government in any case. If you want to be serious in this place about getting some concessions, getting amendments put and getting them accepted, you do not flag at the outset that you are not actually going to insist—but Labor did that. The government simply had to wait it out, and it has been clear that that is what has happened.</para><para>There was, as I said, no obligation for this bill to pass or at least no obligation for the Senate to accede to the request of the House of Representatives. This should very much have been sheeted home to the government. It is the government bill, it is a very unpopular bill and it is a bill which is wrong in so many respects. It should have been amended by this place. Of course, I would have preferred the Democrats amendments, but we got stuck with the ALP's second-best amendments and now we hear that even they are not going to be insisted upon. So it is a great disappointment. I can promise the ALP that we will be not only drawing attention to the coalition's record on public education and on what this bill does but also drawing attention to the fact that the ALP were unable and unwilling to do anything about it.</para><para>As I said earlier, there is no guarantee we will have a Labor government next time around. There is no guarantee that a Labor government will roll it back. We have had no real commitments from Labor on what they will do for public education. We have had no real commitments on this bill. What about the EBA? What about the fact that Labor for so long has said, `We will take the opportunity to get rid of the enrolment benchmark adjustment'? Apparently they are not even going to insist on that. I feel very despondent and I do not know what the vast majority of parents are going to say about this act. They will not know who to turn to in terms of who ought to be in government next because I do not think Labor have adequately demonstrated that their commitment to public education is solid. We had many years of neglect while Labor were in government, when the amount of money spent on public education declined—and on education in general, I might say. Public education suffered under Labor, just as it is suffering under the coalition. It may not be as bad under Labor; I do not know because we have not been given any commitments along those lines.</para><para>This will be a major election issue. Labor are being criticised, as far as I can see, by most parents in this country. Most thinking, decent Australians will criticise both major parties over this decision. It is a very sad day for Australian education and I very much regret the statement that Senator Carr made just a few minutes ago in this place; and that is that public education in this country has no-one to turn to, apart from those of us who are at the back of the chamber. I sincerely hope the Democrats will greatly gain out of this in terms of electoral support, but my key concern is what is going to happen to public education in the long term. That raises real questions that have not been answered in this place. Again, I say that it is a great disappointment.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.         </para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.M.

As governments become more experienced and technology-savvy and as consumers, particularly parents, become more aware and empowered in their dealings with the Internet, I am confident that we will see this important legislation become increasingly effective in protecting children from offensive material on the Internet.</para><para>Our next and most publicly debated report was tabled in March of this year and explored the contentious issue of Internet gambling. The report, NetBets, found that the existing interactive gambling models fell well short of the most basic measures that needed to be adopted to ensure safer gambling conditions for consumers.</para><para>For example, the Committee found there were inadequate warnings about the dangers of problem gambling; players were not informed about the odds of winning or losing; the player exclusion measures were grossly inadequate; and there was no permanent display of wins and losses.</para><para>Consequently, the Netbets report recommended a number of harm minimisation policies, which would offer some protection against an increase in problem gambling.</para><para>However, the Internet gambling industry faces a serious public image problem. In fact while much of the community concern with gambling is related to poker machines, Internet gambling has also been perceived in the some negative way.</para><para>Unfortunately the industry's lock of progress in dealing with this negative public perception and its reluctance to adopt the Committee's recommended voluntary pause on the introduction of new gambling sites, this Government yesterday placed a ban on new Internet gambling sites until May next year.</para><para>Our report into the way complaints against the media are dealt with was the focus of our next report, tabled in April of this year.</para><para>We heard many stories of gross invasions of privacy by the media and more alarming we found that the process of making a complaint against a newspaper or radio program was often a frustratingly slow and complicated process.</para><para>In an effort to more efficiently streamline the process of making a complaint against the media and ensuring that complaints were taken seriously, the Committee recommended the creation of a Media Complaints Commission (MCC).</para><para>This independent statutory body would be formed to help individuals in making their complaints and would act as a `one stop shop' for all complaints against the media.

As it stands in the bill, the definition of a road would include any of the following associated with a road: first, a traffic sign; second, traffic control equipment; third, street lighting equipment; fourth, a vehicular ferry; fifth, a bridge or tunnel, including a bridge or tunnel for the use of pedestrians; and finally, a path for the use of persons riding bicycles.</para><para>As I said in my speech on the second reading, it is encouraging that this road funding is being made available to those other sorts of things and not simply and specifically for roads. However, we propose that the definition be expanded slightly to include one further thing; that is, that the funding ought to be made available through local government to a covered car park adjacent to a railway station or bus interchange.</para><para>It is clear from the evidence that there are many people using public transport, be it train or bus. That is a good thing socially and environmentally. But the evidence also illustrates that there are many people who might be encouraged to make better use of trains and buses but who choose not to do so because of the difficulties they may have experienced in relation to leaving their family car, or their key method of transport, at the bus or train station. It is often the case that these car parking areas at interchange stations are unshaded, making it prohibitive to leave your car there all day. That is very much the case in warmer climates and in inclement weather. In many cases, these car parks are unlit, providing insecurity for both the car and the passenger. As a consequence, there is evidence to suggest that there are many people who would make better use of public transport if there were better intermodal operation—that is, if better opportunities were provided to people to access these places.</para><para>I note from an article by Matthew Rogers in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph </inline>of 26 November that the increase in fuel prices which we currently experience has seen a dramatic boost in demand, particular for rail travel. Mr Rogers says in his article that commuters from Sydney's western suburbs are behind an unprecedented boom in demand for rail travel. Stations in the city's west and inner west are reporting passenger increases of up to 60 per cent on last year's numbers. Figures obtained from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> show that some 12,000 more people are catching trains each day than at the same time last year. Most of that growth is coming from the suburbs of Liverpool—up some 59.7 per cent on a year ago; Strathfield up 38.1 per cent; Hurstville up 26.4 per cent; Bankstown on eight per cent; and Parramatta on almost eight per cent. The daily increase in train patronage is the equivalent of a capacity crowd at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. It is quite extraordinary, illustrating two things: when encouraged to do so, people can and will use public transport and, when you do have that change in transport behaviour, there needs to be a governmental response to that in terms of best facilitating that and making the best options available to people. </para><para>In moving this amendment, what we are seeking to do, quite clearly, is to ensure that local governments, if they have the option and they choose to, are able to use some of this funding to upgrade or introduce quality car parking stations which are covered and are security protected with lighting for both the vehicles and the passengers, as a carrot, as it were—rather than a stick—to try to draw more people to those stations and to make better use of them. I understand that Labor have indicated that they will not be supporting this amendment, and I express genuine disappointment at that, particularly when you look at this article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> and you see that the suburbs and areas mentioned in that particular article are Labor constituencies, Labor seats. I would have thought that, with these kinds of mortgage belt areas, where people are living in the outer suburbs and are, of necessity, using the train to access workplaces in the city, this would be something that the Labor Party ought to support. I do not see this change as being particularly astonishing or remarkable; I see it as being very sensible. It is good public policy. I would have thought that Labor would have been behind that. Once again I sincerely plea with Labor to give serious consideration to this amendment. I believe it is worthy of consideration. If this amendment is passed, it will make no fundamental change to the bill or to the act. It makes terrific sense on social and environmental grounds. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>21057</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While I appreciate the reasons behind Senator Greig moving this amendment, the government will not be supporting the amendment, because it really does extend the definition of a road beyond what one would normally anticipate would be a road. The sealing of car parks, particularly around railway stations, is something that the state governments are principally responsible for. In our view, it is something the state governments should do. The underlying principle of the whole roads to recovery grant was to ensure that this was additional money and that state governments, in particular, would not take the opportunity to cost shift from the things for which they are responsible and the things they should be funding and then put that responsibility on councils.</para></talk.start><para>In addition, for consistency, the definition we have adopted, with one minor exception, is the definition of a road under the Australian Land Transport Development Act, which deals with national highways. For legislative consistency, we have adopted the same definition with, as I say, a minor exception which deletes boat ramps from the definition. I am not quite sure—and my advisers have said that they are not quite sure—why boat ramps are included in definitions of the national highway, but we have deleted it from this one. For legislative consistency, we hope to maintain the definition that is in the act when the federal parliament is dealing with similar issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21057</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Greig is correct: the Labor Party is not in a position to support this amendment. I am advised by Mr Martin Ferguson that he and his office are concerned about the time frames in relation to the circulation of the amendment. I understand that it was advised to their office only after lunch yesterday. Their concern is that in fact the bill has been in circulation since Wednesday last week, and their view is that it is a somewhat ad hoc way to approach the issue of transport. As the government has outlined, this bill is essentially about roads, and the Labor Party is happy with the definition as it exists in relation to roads. While we are not necessarily averse to it in another form, we believe that in relation to this legislation it is somewhat ill fitted.</para></talk.start><para>I have been asked to point out to the Democrats that, if the issue of transparency is of concern, the Labor Party would question why no support was provided for the speed rail probity inquiry, which would have provided some transparency in relation to that process. I am also advised by Mr Ferguson that Labor would appreciate more consultation with the Democrats in relation to transport matters and, in particular, to the timing, which would have allowed us to consider this in a more relaxed environment. However, I am cognisant of the fact that we are dealing with this bill in an expeditious fashion and that we have not got the same amount of time that we normally would have. Labor is concerned that this is a bit of an ad hoc initiative and that it does not fit with the general thrust of the legislation in terms of the definitions. On behalf of Mr Ferguson, I would also like to convey that, as far as Labor and he are concerned, a more cooperative relationship in relation to transport may be an objective that could be pursued between the two parties in relation to timeliness, contact and context. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21058</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to briefly comment on the Democrats' amendment and to indicate that One Nation will not be supporting the amendment. I would also like to take this opportunity to make a couple of comments, Firstly, I wish to commend the government for its funding package for roads, which is going directly to the councils, and to speak briefly on some issues relating to areas in North Queensland. The Cook Shire, which is a substantial shire in the north of Queensland that takes up predominantly the entire Cape York Peninsula, does have a particular problem in relation to roads. It is heartening to see in the government's proposal for Queensland that the existing allocations for identified road grants will rise from 18.7 per cent to 20.8 per cent—a substantial increase. Returning to the issue of the Cook Shire, which finds itself in an extremely high rainfall area and where the roads suffer substantial erosion, I take this opportunity to call on the federal government to look at its predicament in relation to roads. All of the roads in the Cook Shire are predominantly dirt or gravel formed roads and they suffer considerably during the wet.</para></talk.start><para>The other area I would like to briefly speak about is the tableland, consisting of the Mareeba Shire, the Atherton Shire, the Herberton Shire and the Eacham Shire. The roads within those shires are predominantly bitumen. There has been substantial development in the last couple of years on the tableland, particularly in the sugar industry. This expansion is extremely welcome following the downturn in other agricultural activities up there, particularly in the tobacco industry. This expansion, from approximately a million tonnes annually to two million tonnes, has also brought a heavy impact on the road infrastructure. So, again, I commend the government in the passage of this bill in that the funding will go directly to those shires. I hope it will help to alleviate in some way the extra pressure on the local governments.</para><para>Having said that, I would like to place on record the concern of Pauline Hanson's One Nation about the cost of fuel, and that has been raised before in this debate. What is the use of upgrading a road if you cannot afford the cost of the fuel to travel on it? That would be my only criticism in relation to this bill: the government has failed to listen to the cries for help from the Australian people about the cost of fuel. I see this bill as a step in the right direction. It will help the local governments in their local areas. I ask the government to also take into consideration the particular impacts in the Cook Shire in relation to their heavy rainfall and also the impact of the increased traffic on roads in the local shires of the Atherton Tableland, which is related to the expansion in the sugar industry. Finally, I believe that the amendment put forward by the Democrats could raise considerable long-term problems in relation to the allocation of this funding.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21058</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will take a brief opportunity to respond to my critics. The minister, perhaps not surprisingly, raised the issue of the state and Commonwealth nexus. Last Sunday, at Government House in Sydney, I had the privilege to listen to the last in the current series of the Boyer Lectures, where the Chief Justice of the High Court, Mr Murray Gleeson, spoke on the role of the law in the Constitution. He mused over the fact that, at a function he attended recently, it was brought to his attention that the UN had declared next year the International Year of the Elephant. In response to this, it was suggested that each nation would produce a book to celebrate this: the US would produce a book called `Elephants: how to manage them and profit from them'; the Germans would produce a book called `Elephants: their training and discipline'; and the Australians would produce a book called `Elephants: a state or federal problem'. The more time I spend in this place, the more nationalist I become. </para></talk.start><para>The nexus we continue to experience between state and Commonwealth jurisdiction is frustrating. However, I do not think the minister was saying that my proposal could not be done but rather that it ought not be done. There is a fundamental difference. Senator Mackay mentioned the Speedrail inquiry. In all sincerity, I did not understand the nexus; however, she went on in a more general sense to talk about cooperation between Labor and the Democrats. I have no difficulty in encouraging that, as I would with the government—I am nothing if not reasonable. However, I state clearly for the record that the reason I had not contacted Labor directly with my amendment is that I thought it was very simple and spoke for itself. I did not think it needed explanation. I was not proposing fundamental or comprehensive changes to the bill. My recollection is that my amendment was circulated before your second reading contribution and, with respect, I had no consultation from your office on the second reading amendment.</para><para>Senator Harris referred to the potential long-term problems with my amendment. With respect, Senator Harris, I do not concede that. I see no comprehensive or ongoing difficulty with the amendment. I wonder, if this amendment were to pass, whether many councils would take advantage of it. Certainly the opportunity is there for them, but my experience in liaising with delegates at the ALGA conference, which concluded in Canberra in recent days, was that there is a great sense of excitement and tremendous enthusiasm. The minister was quite right when he said in his second reading speech that both governments are extremely keen for this money, and I can understand that, having come from a local government background. I note with interest that my old bailiwick, in the town of Vincent, will receive $160,000 over four years, which is about enough money to seal two rights of ways of about 100 metres in length. So it is not overwhelming in the inner city areas.</para><para>In summing up, I concede that I am not going to win this one, but I do think it was a genuine attempt on my part to bring some focus back to public transport in what has been a very vehicle based, fossil fuel based debate.

This bill clarifies the government's existing powers to safeguard the public interest in electronic addressing services including domain name management. The bill is a key element in the framework for the introduction of competition to the .au domain space. The bill ensures that the government has the necessary powers to safeguard the public interest in electronic advertising services, such as Internet domain names. This will underpin the government's policy of responsible self-regulatory management for the .au Internet domain. It is important that the government ensures that a safety net is in place in case problems arise in the future. The government's position on the introduction of competition to domain name registration has the support of the Internet industry, auDA and other major players in the domain name space. These amendments recognise the importance of electronic addressing services such as domain names to end users by ensuring that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has powers to direct a manager of electronic addressing in relation to consumer protection matters as well as competition matters. The amendments will also ensure that the government has a number of options as to how it can become involved in electronic addressing management to ensure a sensible safety net underpins self-regulation of this important Internet infrastructure. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (MORAL RIGHTS) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21060</page.no><id.no>R971</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21060</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 7 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21061</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say at the outset that there has been some movement on the <inline ref="R971">Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999</inline> legislation. There has been some movement by the government, and we are pleased to see that. We are pleased to see that the government has seen some sense and done a backflip in response to the opposition's concerns about the proposed moral rights legislation as it was first drafted. The government has recognised at last that what it was proposing to do was, in essence, the wrong thing. It was proposing to take an agreement that was made specifically for the film and TV industry and apply it across the entire arts industry. For some time we have made it very clear that this situation was unacceptable. We have been prepared to specifically amend the bill to implement a comprehensive moral rights regime to reflect the film and television agreement and concerns within the wider arts industry. As I say, the government, aware that both Labor and the Democrats were prepared to support amending this legislation, has at last seen some reason and has substantially adopted Labor's amendments. These amendments will now be introduced by the government. We are prepared to support them because they are significant improvements on the government's initial bill. As the government is aware, there is still some concern in the arts industry in relation to the application of certain parts of this legislation. Therefore, we will be watching its application closely, and we will be prepared to make further amendments to the bill if required. </para></talk.start><para>One aspect of moral rights that is not specifically addressed in this legislation is moral rights for indigenous Australians. For indigenous Australians, art is an expression of all aspects of life and identity, and art is a major way of passing on culture to future indigenous generations. Many indigenous artworks depict culturally important content such as creation stories and ceremonies. Certain images, techniques and styles have developed over time, originating from and identifying particular indigenous groups. Indigenous law and custom may control the use of these. Therefore, accuracy of reproduction is of great importance as inaccurate reproduction of an artwork can cause deep offence to those familiar with the Dreaming. I believe that the introduction of moral rights of authorship and integrity will be significant for indigenous artists. There are of course issues in relation to extending moral rights protection to indigenous clans over works that contain traditional ritual knowledge. This has not been addressed in the current legislation. We give a commitment to consult extensively with indigenous artists and communities and other parties as to the most appropriate way of extending specific moral rights to indigenous artists. </para><para>Having said all that, this legislation has taken a long road to get to this stage. It must be remembered that the Labor Party first promised an examination of moral rights for artists by the Keating Labor government at the 1993 federal election. In June 1994, the ministers for arts, justice and communications jointly released a discussion paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Proposed moral rights legislation for copyright creators</inline>. From these discussions, draft moral rights amendments were prepared and circulated just before the election in February 1996. Unfortunately, as we all know, there was a change of government. That led to the current government taking what we believe to be a less than satisfactory approach to moral rights since 1996. The Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 was introduced in June 1997 and was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee reported in October 1997. Because of, essentially, the government's inability to resolve industry differences, the government withdrew the moral rights provisions of the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997. Senator Alston, then Minister for the Arts, gave a commitment in June 1998 that he would reintroduce moral rights amendments by the end of 1998 after further consultation. The government finally got around to introducing this bill, the <inline ref="R971">Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 1999</inline>, in December 1999. When we finally got the legislation, it was sadly lacking in substance and demanded significant amendment. As I said earlier, we have drawn a number of concerns to the government's attention. At last they have listened to most of them, and that is why at this stage we are supporting the amendments that are being proposed by the government today. </para><para>The introduction of moral rights for Australian artists is a significant achievement. Moral rights seek to complement existing economic rights but, unlike economic rights, moral rights seek to deal with the creator's honour and reputation through the way their work is used. We believe this bill, as well as having a philosophical commitment to moral rights, should address Australia's obligations under the 1971 Paris Revision of the 1928 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Labor support moral rights because they provide recognition that a work is part of an author's character and personality and therefore any unauthorised change to the work could reflect badly on the author. The right of individuals to protect the integrity of their work and the right to have their work attributed to them are at the core of moral rights. The right to be able to protect a work from derogatory treatment has also been addressed. `Moral rights' is defined to mean the following three rights: the right of attribution of authorship, the right not to have authorship falsely attributed and the right of integrity of authorship. I am pleased that the government has done this backflip at the last moment. It is now moving substantial amendments to its original bill. It is now taking what we believe to be a more bipartisan and inclusive approach to the introduction of comprehensive moral rights legislation for all Australian artists by moving the amendments the opposition will be supporting today.</para><para>In conclusion, on behalf of the opposition I would like to thank the government for its cooperation in adopting the majority of Labor's concerns in relation to the inadequacy of the initial bill. I also place on record the work of the previous shadow minister for the arts, Duncan Kerr, and the shadow Attorney-General, Robert McClelland. The opposition would also like to acknowledge the work—and I must stress this—of the Arts Law Centre of Australia, especially Delia Browne, who is a respected moral rights expert. The centre's ongoing work to achieve moral rights for Australian artists has beenbrought to fruition in the amendments that we are accepting today. Labor will be supporting the circulated government amendments. We welcome the introduction of moral rights for Australians and this legislation, to the extent that it does that. </para><para>Can I also indicate that there will be some amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. We are disappointed that we are not in a position to have given them greater consideration. They were presented to us at about 11 a.m. this morning, less than two hours ago. There has been absolutely no consultation with the opposition on these amendments. We are not aware, for instance, of the extent, if any, of any consultation that the Democrats have undertaken with indigenous artists in forming these amendments. We understand the spirit and direction they want to take, but I think this legislation demands more than a less-than-two-hour consideration of amendments such as the ones that are to be moved by the Democrats. The issues of moral rights for indigenous artists are serious issues. We think it would be appropriate for the government to instigate an inquiry into moral rights for indigenous artists, and such an inquiry would be supported by the opposition. We cannot support Senator Ridgeway's amendments if he decides to go ahead with them today. We cannot support them at this stage but, as I signalled earlier, this area does require attention and will be given attention by Labor in government. As I say, there probably is a very good case for an inquiry into this area in the interim.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>21062</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats see today as a very important day for the Australian arts community. I believe that Australia is a step closer to fulfilling our obligations under the Berne convention. I would also like to be able to say that I am pleased about Australia meeting a debt to our indigenous arts community by recognising their very particular moral rights at both the individual and collective level. I will talk more on that, in the committee stage. I would like the chamber to note that I am attempting to shorten my speech during the second reading debate in order to talk more specifically about indigenous moral rights. Perhaps it may well come about, as part of the government's undertaking today, that they will address a number of issues that I raise. Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats congratulate the government on its amendments and are pleased to be able to support the package of amendments tabled today to introduce moral rights into the Australian Copyright Act. </para></talk.start><para>Special congratulations are also due to the Arts Law Centre of Australia and most especially its Director, Ms Delia Browne. She has worked tirelessly bringing this legislation to fruition. Without her dedication and passion on this issue over the last decade, the arts practitioners of Australia would surely be seeing a very different set of amendments being considered in this chamber. Credit also needs to go to Tamara Winikoff of the National Association of the Visual Arts, Jose Borghino of the Australian Society of Authors, Sue McCreadie and Ian David of the Australian Writers Guild, and Richard Harris of the Australian Screen Directors Association. Every one of them has worked hard to negotiate these amendments and reach consensus amongst themselves, the artists they represent and the government. In reaching that consensus, much ground has been conceded by the arts sector, the film and television sector and the government.</para><para>The Australian Democrats are particularly mindful of the concerns still held by the arts sector as to how the bill in its form today will work in practice. In recognition of the other strengths of the bill and the overall benefits that legislative moral rights protection could bring, the ASA and the Arts Law Centre have put those concerns to one side, and recommended the enactment of the bill, which we are happy to support. However, I would like to put those concerns on the public record. They relate to the sections of the bill that deal specifically with the agreement that was negotiated by the film and television sector with the government and, in turn, how that agreement will impact on the rest of the arts sectors. Those sections are 195AM, 195AN subsection (4), 195AW, 195AZM, 195AZN and 195AZO.</para><para>It is the Democrats' understanding that the agreement reached between the film and television sector was only ever meant to apply to that particular sector and it was on that basis that other art sectors felt it appropriate not to be directly involved in those negotiations. It is also my understanding that the government has developed amendments which will establish two consent procedures that will operate side by side for the film and television sector and also for the rest of the arts sector. This is borne out by sections 195AW and 195AWA. Whilst it is clearly not an ideal situation and will create some anomalies, all parties to that agreement have entered into this outcome in good faith, and the Democrats commend them for that.</para><para>The effect of these consent provisions will be that already published novels, plays and musical works which at some point in the future become incorporated into a film or television adaptation will be subject to the consent provisions that apply to the film and television sector. In effect, it means that the duration of the moral right of integrity of authorship in relation to a novel which is adapted for film will die with the author and not continue for the life of copyright protection, that is, another 50 years. That is something that will create a situation where the right of integrity of authorship will vary from one novel to another, depending on whether they have been adapted for film and TV or not.</para><para>The Australian Democrats will therefore be watching very closely to see how those provisions operate in practice and to what extent other measures to protect the rights of authors are able to operate to good effect. In particular, the Arts Law Centre and the ASA are placing great faith in section 195AWB, which provides that consents are invalidated by duress or false or misleading statements. However, the reality that consents with waivers recently became common practice in contracts for sectors of the arts industry only heightens the need for all parties to the negotiations surrounding this bill to make sure that the good faith with which those agreements have been entered into is not allowed to dissipate.</para><para>The Australian Democrats also want to give credit to the government for the significant advance in its position on the operation of moral rights in relation to public art. We welcome these new amendments in 195AT. We believe they will assist greatly in fostering the development of a public art code of conduct. The Democrats therefore welcome these amendments. We endorse them with the reservations I have mentioned. We hope that the good faith of the parties will continue into the future so that all authors and our arts industry as a whole will benefit from this consensus outcome. </para><para>I note the comments from my colleague in the opposition in terms of the indigenous moral rights provision that I have put forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It needs to be said for the record that, whilst there have been attempts to deal with these issues over a long period, I do not think it is fair to say that consideration of this issue has been left to the last two hours. Clearly, this is an issue that has been raised time and time again by indigenous people. It is an issue that I raised with the shadow spokesperson for arts some four weeks ago. At that time I did not have to hand a copy of an amendment. That has now been provided. It simply needs to be stated for the record that consultation did occur. Whilst the ALP is not prepared to support that, I would hope that it is prepared to support a further inquiry and specific actions by the government to ensure that indigenous moral rights are dealt with adequately.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>21064</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the interests of facilitating the passage of this and other bills in this hour, I will speak more briefly than I would otherwise have. As Senator Ridgeway has indicated, the issue of copyright is a significant and important one and, in a way, it is a shame that we cannot have a more fulsome debate on the broader issues. I do want also to flag some other matters to put it in the broader context of the need for ongoing reform in the area of copyright. </para></talk.start><para>This particular legislation goes part way to doing that. It has taken a fair while to appear, and I think we need to continue to make the point that there are other areas where we need action, particularly if we are to honourall the obligations we have made in international law in relation to human rights, culture and other areas. These include things such as directors' copyright, resale royalty rights—which is particularly important for indigenous artists whose works are now being sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars when they were bought for maybe a couple of hundred dollars a matter of years ago—comprehensive legislation protection for indigenous copyright, both individual and collective, and also the issue of performance copyright, which is an economic right rather than a moral right and therefore, in that sense, not necessarily appropriate for this legislation. But the broader issue of copyright reform and the need for further action in relation to that needs to be acknowledged. </para><para>At the moment the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill provides that authors of literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work shall be granted moral rights protection in their work in which the copyright subsists, but performers in sound recordings are not included in that. Certainly my view is that we need to include accreditation to and preservation of integrity in performers' audio and audiovisual work. This was something that was mentioned in the present government's pre-election arts policy `For art's sake—a fair go', which indicated it would devise workable performance copyright legislation. I trust the government is still working to deliver on that commitment. </para><para>It is important that performers be given a legal right to receive equitable remuneration for the reproduction, public performance, broadcasting and communication to the public of their recorded performances. The World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, adopted the World Performances and Phonograms Treaty<inline font-style="italic"></inline>in Geneva in 1996, which protects all of those performers' rights in sound recordings. The treaty has provided important economic incentives for performers, yet under the current copyright law in Australia there is no protection for performers. The only right performers currently have is where a sound recording of a performance is used in a film and the recording was not initially authorised for that purpose. </para><para>Under the copyright law there are two copyrights relevant to the music industry, neither of which give rights to performers on sound recordings. One of those is a musical work in a work comprising both music and lyrics, and the owner of the copyright there in the musical work is in the songwriter. The second copyright is the sound recording which is a work comprised of a series of recorded sounds and the sound is on a disc or a record. The owner of copyright in a sound recording is the person who paid for it, which is usually the record companies. The largest owners of these copyrights, of course, are the major record companies.  </para><para>As a result of the copyright, the owners have the right, among other rights, to play the work publicly, to broadcast or to copy the work, most usually through the selling of CDs and so on. When either copyrights are played publicly or broadcast, the venues such as entertainment centres, pubs, hairdressers, restaurants, radio stations, cinemas and so on have to pay for the right to do that. They pay two licence fees. The fee for the musical work goes to APRA, which distributes that income to songwriters, and the fee for the sound recording goes to the PPCA, which distributes that income to the owners of the sound recordings and artists entitled to an artist royalty. </para><para>Any payments performers currently receive under their contracts with record companies and/or from the PPCA are based on their contribution to the recording costs of sound recordings, not linked to their performance per se. Although the record company pays the initial recording costs, the record company recoups those costs from the performers. That is the artist's royalties. So, in effect, performers are paying for the costs of recording. That is not so for composers. As a result of the copyright entitlements in the act on the musical work, composers are paid a royalty, known as a mechanical royalty, on every record from the first record sold. </para><para>Recognising performers' copyright would give performers with recordings the same rights and economic stream as other copyright owners; it would not be an equivalent income stream but the same rights to some economic stream. In contrast to the existing rights under the act, performers would have rights in relation to a range of uses of authorised recordings for performances and moral rights. It is my view that performers are entitled to equitable remuneration in recognition of the value of their performances. I am sure all of us could list—and I would if I was not rushed for time—any number of well-known songs where the performer, whether it is a singer or other musicians, clearly contributed to the success of that recording yet they have no copyright under law; only the writer of the song does. </para><para>Because performers have no legal rights for negotiating directly with end users of recordings on which they have performed, they have no opportunity to establish income streams which are independent of the maker of the first recording of a live performance. So if performers are granted legal rights to their performances, they will be entitled to receive payment for the use of their recorded performances. Performers would receive remuneration for the reproduction, broadcasting and public performance of their recordings, as do the composers and the owners of sound recordings currently. </para><para>Because performers have no rights, they have extremely limited income streams, and I think that this point needs to be made. If we are looking at trying to encourage or generate economic incentives for the arts industry and the music industry, some guarantee of income stream—some right to that through the work of the performer—is absolutely crucial. The average income for an Australian musician—a non-composing one—is well below average weekly earnings. I think addressing something such as performance copyright would go some way to improving the opportunities for people who wish to pursue activity in the arts industry and the music industry. </para><para>I do urge the government, in their ongoing efforts to improve, reform and update copyright law, ideally to address all of those issues I outlined at the start of my contribution, but particularly performance copyright. As a former musician of absolutely no note whatsoever, I could be seen to have an interest in that. Certainly, from my previous experience and involvement in the music industry, I am well aware of the sacrifices people make, the very limited opportunity to earn a decent living and the fact that performers of whatever type—whatever instrument or voice—make an integral contribution to the value of a sound recording. Their contribution and the rights attached to that recording should be enshrined in law, as it currently is for the composers of those works.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>21066</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It has been a long haul in the issue of moral rights. I was shadow minister for the arts—I cannot actually remember when; it may have been the mid-nineties—and this was an issue then when Labor was in government. It is a tough issue; it is not easy, and I am delighted that it has been the coalition government that has finally brought legislation into this chamber to deal with the issue of moral rights. </para></talk.start><para>I think I read about six folders of material on moral rights, and I realised what a complex question it is. There are arguments and views on all sides. I visited the Arts Law Centre and I know that they have had a particular role to play in this issue over many, many years. Labor had 13 years and they got to exposure draft bill stage, I think, and here we are with a bill and with some action. That is what the public are coming to expect from the coalition government: rather than rhetoric, it is actually a government which does something. </para><para>Delia Browne from the Arts Law Centre has brought her knowledge and experience to this debate and has contributed enormously, as has been said by the Democrats and the Labor Party. She also brought to bear her skills in consulting and has brought consensus among the various interests within the arts community. Anybody who has read anything on this area realises that there are various views even within the arts community about the issue of moral rights. So our congratulations ought to go to Delia Browne for the contribution that she has made to this debate and to this bill. </para><para>The bill is another important landmark in the government's ongoing program of copyright reform. It establishes for the first time a comprehensive regime for the protection of the moral rights of Australian authors, artists and film makers. It implements the coalition's commitment at the 1996 election, reiterated at the 1998 election, to develop legislation to ensure greater respect for the integrity of creative endeavour. </para><para>There has been increasing criticism that Australia's implementation of its obligations under the Berne convention is fragmentary and incomplete. This bill will address those criticisms. This bill is not just about fulfilling international obligations. More importantly, it is about acknowledging the great importance of respect for the integrity of creative behaviour. At its most basic, the bill is a recognition of the importance to Australian culture of literary, artistic, music and dramatic works and of those who create them. The government recognises the concerns of users of copyright, such as broadcasters, advertising agencies, film makers and newspaper publishers, that moral rights will unduly hamper their existing practices. However, if a user of a work respects the rights of the creator, the user will not need the author's permission in making use of that work. Thus, if a user acknowledges, where reasonable, the authorship of the work and, where reasonable, avoids treatment that is prejudicial to the reputation of the author, there can be no objection by the author or the creator. </para><para>The government's intention is that as a result of these amendments the broader film industry consent provision currently in the bill will only apply to the extent that a work is actually included in a film. If a work is never included, the restricted consent provision we are introducing today will operate to limit the range of acts and omissions to which the consent may be sought. The existing consent provisions reflect the outcome of close to two years of negotiations with the film industry, represented by the Film and Television Group, a body with representatives from all sectors of the film industry and established by the industry to develop a unified industry position on moral rights. </para><para>The bill is another initiative from a government committed to reshaping copyright for the 21st century and beyond. We have addressed the main issues of controversy and have worked hard to accommodate as far as possible the views conveyed to us.  </para><para>I wish to respond to a couple of comments. Senator Ridgeway received a letter from Senator Alston dated yesterday, and I wish to read into Hansard the relevant part of that letter: </para><quote><para>However, I will ask my Department to give serious consideration to the principles underlying your proposals in the context of its development of legislative amendments and other measures to address the issues you raise. I have asked my Department to bring forward a final proposal for the consideration of myself and my fellow Ministers early in the new year. I undertake to ensure that you—</para></quote><para>that is, Senator Ridgeway—</para><quote><para>are consulted in my Department's deliberations, including on draft proposals and legislative amendments. I will also ensure that my Department consults with representatives of appropriate peak Indigenous bodies. </para></quote><para>I wanted to put on the record that commitment that the minister has made to Senator Ridgeway. </para><para>With regard to the comments Senator Bartlett made about actors being granted moral rights in relation to films, the bill deals with moral rights in works and films as required by the Berne convention, of which Australia has been a member for many years. Performers' moral rights are dealt with in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty concluded in 1996 and not yet in force internationally. The government has consulted affected interests on the possibility of legislating for the obligations under that WIPO treaty, including performers' moral rights. Further consideration will be given to this issue following a diplomatic conference taking place in Geneva as we speak to adopt a protocol to the WIPO treaty to cover performers' rights in films, TV programs and other audiovisual productions. I hope that addresses some of the concerns that Senator Bartlett had. </para><para>In closing this debate, I want to again say that it is easy to run away from the tough tasks. It is easy to put it off and keep having consultations. It takes a government that is committed to appropriate reform to bring in these sorts of reforms to address, to the best of our ability, the issues that have concerned both sides of the industry—the artists and those who use the works of artists—and to accommodate the very differing views. The bill, with the changes that are being moved, forms a balanced package of rights that will represent a great advance in the recognition of, and respect for, the creativity of authors, artists and film makers. It is a workable scheme. It deserves the strong support of this parliament. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>21067</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>21067</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

I think it does need to be put on the record that we have been encouraged to move these amendments as a result of the strong support we have received from indigenous artists and representative organisations across Australia. I intend to refer to some of the comments that have been forwarded to me in recent days. </para><para>First, I think it is important to explain why indigenous Australians feel so strongly about the need for steps to be taken to have their cultural rights recognised and protected in the non-indigenous legal system. Ms Terri Janke, a well-known indigenous solicitor and a person who can be described as an expert in relation to intellectual property rights, was commissioned by ATSIC and AIATSIS to prepare a report on how indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights could be advanced in Australia. That report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Our Culture: Our Future</inline>, was released last year. It is the culmination of many years of community consultation and research by Ms Janke. It has been described as a groundbreaking analysis and blueprint, and it has guided the Australian Democrats in the development of our amendments on indigenous moral rights. </para><para>The author of <inline font-style="italic">Our Culture: Our Future</inline>, Terri Janke, explains that indigenous art and cultural expression is interwoven with indigenous identity and that they both reinforce and define the other. The protection of indigenous cultural expression in all its varied forms is therefore a key means by which governments can demonstrate that they value those indefinable qualities that distinguish Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I will not go into detail about what Terri has to say about that, but the Australian Democrats drafted these amendments with the recommendations of the Janke report.  </para><para>I note the response from the government—an undertaking to look at these issues again in the new year—but I think Terri Janke's comments capture some of the main principles that need to be reflected in our national laws. Those principles include that art is the primary vehicle for indigenous cultural expression. It can take many forms, but it is through our art that we express our identity and our history and transmit culture to our children. Indigenous artwork is also a means by which customary laws and practices are learnt, reinforced and respected. Indigenous art is not just something of aesthetic beauty; it has layers of meaning, some of which the unpractised eye is oblivious to, and it should be respected and revered. Indigenous cultural expression is part of indigenous heritage. It is not owned by individual artists; they are custodians of the knowledge and wisdom it incorporates and reflects, which is the heritage of the community from which it originated countless generations ago. </para><para>The second last point is that indigenous moral rights are therefore collective rights that are inalienable from their community of origin, no matter who buys an art work, no matter who dances a corroboree. They are required to pay respect to the appropriate community whose culture is embodied in that work. They are required to uphold the right of integrity and the right of attribution of that group or the individual nominated by that group to exercise those moral rights. Indigenous moral rights carry with them a weight of individual responsibilities. As someone authorised to paint your community's dreaming, an artist takes on many responsibilities as a custodian which carry with them grave and very harsh penalties if breaches occur, regardless of who carries out those breaches.</para><para>It is these principles which the Australian Democrats and I personally believe are long overdue in our national laws. It is these principles that need to be incorporated into our copyright act and other legislation, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, to ensure that indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights are fully recognised, understood, appreciated and protected. These outcomes are critical to the practices and maintenance of indigenous cultures in Australia and therefore the very identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</para><para>Our amendments will recognise Australian indigenous cultural work, which includes literary, dramatic, musical, artist, artistic and cinematographic works. These works are distinguished from other works by their significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Perhaps the most important feature of indigenous moral rights contained in our amendments is the recognition that these rights are both collective and individual. Each community determines how they deal with that, and I will leave that discussion for another time.</para><para>The story in all of this relating to the need for adequate protection of indigenous moral rights is perhaps best illustrated by the recent actions of the International Olympic Committee in relation to its own web site. This is a story that I think has been untold and unheard of in Australia. I have been informed by the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Association that the site has been displaying and promoting significant Aboriginal works as free downloads to be used as computer wallpaper without having sought the artists' consent. Since the IOC is based in Switzerland, Swiss law applies, which requires substantial legal costs in both Australia and Switzerland. Under Swiss law, the artist has the moral right to decide whether, when and how the work may be altered and whether, when and how the work may be used to create a derived work. This gives the indigenous artists another claim not yet available in Australia; that is, to protect the integrity of their important cultural works. To date, NIAAA reports that correspondence with the International Olympic Committee has demonstrated its unmitigated contempt for indigenous Australians' rights in pursuing the case. </para><para>NIAAA is demanding, on behalf of those artists, that the downloading of the art works cease, that damages be paid for copyright infringement, that additional damages be paid for breach of moral rights and that the payment of licences for approved usage be made. In addition to that, NIAAA is also demanding that an official letter of apology from senior IOC directors be presented to the artists who have had their works abused and that this letter be posted on the IOC web site. The clear message from this example is that many people, both in Australia and overseas, continue to regard indigenous cultural expression as a resource that is open to use by anyone. If these things were to happen here, our laws would be inadequate. There is no protection. However, in this case indigenous people are able to go offshore and use Swiss laws to at least try to assert the protection of their rights.</para><para>The urgency for adequate protection against what, to many indigenous communities, is a form of sacrilege has been accentuated by the exponential growth in the demand for indigenous cultural works in both Australia and internationally. The indigenous culture industry is currently estimated to be worth some $85 million per annum. The famous auction house of Sotheby's grossed in excess of $4 million at a single auction of indigenous fine art this year, a record figure for an industry that is barely four decades old but has the unique claim of originating from the world's oldest living cultures. It is not surprising that this vibrant sector of the national and international fine arts market is described by specialists in the industry as the raging bull of Australian art. But how long will indigenous cultures continue to win such accolades if they are left to flounder with a system of laws that do not even begin to recognise their fundamental characteristics and provide appropriate measures of protection? In a year when Australia reflects its pride in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures by showcasing them at the Sydney Olympics, how is it that members of the government can dismiss outright all efforts to extend basic legal protections for these cultures? As Patrick Dodson said recently:</para><quote><para>We can have no more of a schizophrenic national behaviour where the people celebrate existence, while those who are guided by the political pragmatism of the day deny us the rights to our country and the rights to maintain our spiritual strength. </para><para>We have to take matters beyond a faint recognition of the existence of Indigenous people and the things that are important to us, to an embracing, by a mature nation, of that which makes us Aboriginal—our unique identities, our laws and languages, our responsibilities to the country and the rights to maintain our spiritual strength.</para></quote><para>It is a sad fact that in the year 2000 every indigenous community contemplating entering the art market faces a double-edged sword—the commercialisation of part of their culture and the associated potential economic returns versus the loss of any control, on the part of the community which owns it, over how that work is used, displayed, copied, modified and so on.</para><para>There is a need for legislative recognition, and I would have hoped that the government would have seen fit to bring that forward today. Even this morning, with the Prime Minister's own commitment to reconciliation, it seems to me that even in practical terms this is a very simple and easy thing to do, and so far the government has not come on board. There is a need, I think, to recognise that this is a market open to abuse of indigenous peoples and there would inevitably be not just dispossession in the historical sense but also in the very real, modern and contemporary sense of art that is an expression of identity itself. I do not want to refer too much to other cases other than mentioning the Carpets case from 1994. People may remember that as one dealt with by the Federal Court and one where indigenous artworks were appropriated and used as part of images that were reproduced in the manufacture of carpets. </para><para>In closing, I would like to list the indigenous arts organisations which have wholeheartedly supported the amendments for indigenous moral rights, which I tabled today. This list includes very well-known individuals as well as organisations which are operating from or representing remote indigenous communities across the country. The very broad support base that these people represent provides some indication of the importance of these amendments and what they hold for indigenous arts communities: Mr Djon Mundine of the National Gallery of Australia; Ms Hetti Perkins, the Curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts at the New South Wales Art Gallery; the board and artist membership of the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Company-operative; Mr Kevin Frances of NIAAA; Ms Justine Saunders, an actor; Mr Geoff Clark, the Chair of ATSIC; Ms Cathy Craigie, a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council; the coordinators of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in Yirrkala; Bangarra Aboriginal Dance Theatre; Delia Browne of the Arts Law Centre; Anna Ward of VISCOPY; Jose Borghino of the Australian Society of Authors; and Tamara Winikoff of NAVA.  </para><para>I think that people have clearly expressed their views as to why these amendments ought to be supported. Whilst I understand that the government is not prepared to support them and that the ALP have clearly put their indication on the table, I am disappointed because there is an opportunity to do something real, to do something that has been outstanding for many, many years. It seems to me that, whilst there is a commitment on the part of the government, there needs to be much more than that. I think that there must be a commitment to make sure that legislation is put in place in the new year to guarantee indigenous people protection for their artworks and culture. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21074</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a couple of points in response to Senator Ridgeway.

Those people have been contributing to the ongoing debate, they have been making some pretty important points, and their voices on this issue need to be addressed. </para></talk.start><para>But can I say to Senator Ridgeway: you really have not done these people any good service this afternoon and you really have not brought any credit to yourself, either. The issue is an important one. It needs to be handled properly. To give us less than two hours notice of a batch of amendments, I think, really betrays the fact that what we have here is something that is very much more in line with a cynical manoeuvre of playing politics rather than an intention to get an outcome. You cannot expect to come in here with less than two hours notice on an important issue such as this and then criticise others for not supporting your amendments. These amendments are important. They need to be addressed. We needed more time to address them, but to give less than two hours is a bit rich, and you yourself understand that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator Ridgeway</name></talker><para>—Two weeks. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—We have had these amendments for two hours.

Senator Ridgeway's performing that sort of manoeuvre, cynical as it is, really reflects on a whole group of people who have been concerned about this issue and who have not been in his loop over the last few hours. The speech he just gave would have been prepared before 11 o'clock this morning. He would have known before 11 o'clock this morning that he would be moving these amendments. Was there any attempt to consult with Labor? No. I think that reflects very badly on Senator Ridgeway. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We are concerned to get an outcome on issues such as this, but it is unfair to people on our side of politics who have been concerned with the issue for this to be sprung on us in the last two hours and for Senator Ridgeway to then go on to say, `This is really disappointing. Labor has disappointed us again.' This is just playing politics at the base level. He knew full well what we would do if he sprang these amendments on us at the last moment. He knew full well what would happen if he sprang them on us in a debate which is listed as non-controversial. There is no capacity for divisions at this time of the day. I think what he has really done is let down the people he has worked with—the Djon Mundines and others. He let them down because he did not embark upon a healthy consultative process.  </para><para>I am one who has been involved in this issue for quite some time, even from the time I was Minister Assisting the Treasurer in financial matters and Minister for Consumer Affairs. I would have liked to have been consulted by Senator Ridgeway on these particular amendments. I would have liked to have had some time to address them. I am disappointed in him in that he has sprung these on us at the last moment, knowing full well that he would not get a positive response. </para><para>I can anticipate that Senator Ridgeway will now put out a press statement saying, `Labor betrays indigenous Australians.' I say that that would be totally unfair. We could put one out saying, `Ineptitude of the Democrats,' or, `Who's going to keep the Democrat bastards honest?' and so on. We could indulge in that, but we will not. </para><para>I say to Senator Ridgeway: the best way to progress these issues is not to spring them on people at the last moment. It is probably more important to embark upon a consultation process than to prepare his speech and press statement. Hopefully next time we can actually get this right. As I said, I am in a sense personally offended, because this is an issue that has been very close to me for a long time. Other people in the Labor Party have been addressing it for a long time as well. We would have liked to be in a better position to consider these amendments. To spring them on us now is a base, cynical manoeuvre. I do not say that with any degree of spite; I say that with a sense of frustration. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>21075</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not comment on the remarks of Senator Bolkus as to Senator Ridgeway's motives. All I will say is that the coalition has concerns about the amendments. First, there is a concern about the definition of `Australian indigenous cultural work' as it stands. That really needs a lot more work. There are some issues pertaining to the constitution. There are some issues of the trust, there are fiduciary issues and there are some issues about the obligations and duties of representatives. </para></talk.start><para>The time we have had to consider these amendments has not been long enough. I think we had the amendments a bit longer than did Labor but not long enough to address the issues that have been presented as they have been. We do not have a problem with the issue of recognition of indigenous cultural and artistic rights—I think Senator Alston's letter indicates that—but I point out that the bill in its current form will address some of the concerns Senator Ridgeway raised, irrespective of whether they are indigenous works of art or works of art undertaken by non-indigenous people. The specific issues that he raises in his speech really need to be addressed much more carefully and in a much more detailed manner. This bill has been around for a while; it did not just appear yesterday. Amendments of the sort that are before us really need much greater and much more careful attention. For that reason the coalition will not be supporting the amendments put forward by the Democrats. </para><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>21075</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (IMPROVED MONITORING OF ENTITLEMENTS TO PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21075</page.no><id.no>R1153</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>21075</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 27 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>21076</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am conscious that we have made very little progress this lunchtime on the passage of the bill, so I was going to suggest to the parliamentary secretary, Senator Patterson, that, given the timing, I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech rather than delay the Senate for 20 minutes by reading it.

The bill also attempts to reduce the incidence of doctor shopping—the practice of a person getting multiple prescriptions from different doctors. The opposition support these two goals. We agree with tightening up the eligibility arrangements. However, this should not be at the expense of the privacy of an individual's health information. </para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a $3.8 billion program. It is a significant government program that provides the community with reliable and affordable access to necessary and cost-effective medicine. Under the scheme, the Commonwealth pays about 82 per cent of the cost of PBS listed drugs. Pensioners are required to pay only $3.30 for each script, which makes sure that they have access to the medicines they need at an affordable price. Considering the substantial benefits payable through the PBS, its entitlement arrangements should be properly administered to make sure only eligible people receive the benefits. The government must also be vigilant in making sure that the process of listing a new drug on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is properly administered and that access to low cost pharmaceuticals continues. </para><para>The opposition has serious concerns that the government's implementation of the final report of the review of PBS listing arrangements will weaken the PBS listing process, particularly in the short term. Decisions to place new drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are made on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. No new drug can be made available on the PBS unless the committee has recommended it. </para><para>This committee undertakes rigorous assessments of the cost effectiveness of new drugs before it advises the government on whether the health benefits and costs of a new drug warrant its inclusion on the PBS. In the period 1994 to 1997, the PBAC reviewed 326 major applications. Of these, 182 applications were for new listings on the PBS and 51 were for applications for major changes in indications, conditions of use or prices applying to drugs that were already listed. The remainder were resubmissions or a review of the basis of its pricing negotiations requested by the manufacturers. </para><para>The work of this committee is highly involved and, therefore, it is critical that it comprises people with the necessary experience in interpreting pharmaco-economic analysis and balancing those considerations with other factors, such as clinical need, equity of access, rule of rescue and the total costs to the health care system. The committee's work is not straightforward. Interpreting the data and getting the balance right rests on the committee members possessing the right mix of skills and experience. It is estimated that it takes approximately 18 months for new members to develop that necessary experience. </para><para>Considering the volume of submissions and the complexity of the decisions before the committee, it is very concerning that the government is intending to overhaul the membership of the committee and replace up to six of its members, including its chair, Professor Don Birkett, on 31 December. This, we believe, will create a vacuum on the committee, especially considering no transition arrangements are in place for the new chair. The opposition do not oppose reform in the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee or placing limits on members' terms. However, transition arrangements must be put in place first so the committee's expertise is not lost. Senator Tambling's own report states:  </para><quote><para>The introduction of an overall limit that applies to the number of years any one member could serve would ensure that membership was regularly turned over in future. A possible disadvantage of this system is that some highly valuable members could be retired prematurely. Their departure could create a gap in experience and expertise that may be affected during a transitional period until suitable replacements could be found and gain the necessary experience. </para></quote><para>Senator Tambling's final report goes on to state: </para><quote><para>The role of the Chair is particularly important to the PBAC. This is primarily due to the need to show consistency of decision-making over long periods of time. This is accentuated by the inherent comparative nature of the work of the committee. There are significant advantages in these circumstances in having a PBAC Chairman with full working knowledge of the practices of the Committee and as a repository of corporate knowledge as to how the PBAC has tackled similar decisions in the recent past. </para></quote><para>Clearly, Senator Tambling is ignoring the findings of his own report. </para><para>The Australian system of listing drugs for subsidy is recognised as a world leader and, consequently, proposals to alter the committee must be properly considered and not rushed through the parliament. As the former head of the department of health and now Professor of Health Policy at La Trobe University, Professor Stephen Duckett, pointed out on ABC Radio last Friday: </para><quote><para>Australia is a very small country, and the number of people with expertise in pharmaco-economics is very, very limited. So arguments about new blood and so on really just don't make any sense. What they're trying to do is get rid of the people who know what it's all about and who are being very rigorous in the application of the value-for-money principles. </para></quote><para>It is irresponsible for the government to move these amendments to the PBAC without first putting in place those proper transition arrangements. That is why the opposition will move a second reading amendment to adjourn debate on the bill and refer the amendments to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration and report by 28 February 2001. </para><para>These changes to the PBAC need to be properly considered and transition arrangements need to be put in place. The opposition sees no need to rush the government's PBAC amendments through the parliament. Interim arrangements are already in place for the six committee members whose terms expire on 31 December. What the government does need to do is to put in place transition arrangements. These transition arrangements are required for the changes recommended to both the composition of the committee and members' terms. The government would, therefore, be better off, we think, withdrawing its PBAC amendments until those transition arrangements are put in place. </para><para>I will now turn to discussing the primary aim of this bill, and that is to make sure that only eligible people have access to the PBS. The PBS scheme does not currently require a person to prove their eligibility. Concessional patients must produce a health care card, but for the general benefit no proof of eligibility is currently required. It has therefore been difficult for pharmacists to determine the entitlement status of a customer or to recognise doctor shoppers. The desirability of tightening the legislative requirements to enable dispensers to check a customer's eligibility is therefore recognised, provided that this is done in a cost-effective way. </para><para>This bill will require doctors and other prescribers to put the patient's Medicare number on each prescription. This will allow pharmacists to check who is eligible for the PBS and assist the HIC and pharmacists to identify doctor shoppers. When fully implemented, the government will not pay pharmacists unless they have checked the person's Medicare number and expiry date before dispensing the medicines. In addition, if the number is incorrect when compared to the HIC data, pharmacists will be responsible for tracking down the customer in order to correct their Medicare number or obtain the balance of the payment for the pharmaceuticals. The bill permits pharmacists and doctors to retain the Medicare numbers for future use for the same patients but requires them to maintain the privacy of this information. The bill creates various offences for disclosing or misusing Medicare numbers.  </para><para>There are a number of groups of people who may not have Medicare cards but who are eligible for pharmaceutical benefits, including people with disabilities in the care of a guardian, people who are itinerant, some Aboriginal people, visitors from overseas countries with which Australia has a bilateral agreement, and a person in an emergency situation or someone who has temporarily lost their card. To make sure that in the implementation of this bill access to subsidised PBS drugs is not denied to these eligible people, the scheme will be required to include a number of exemptions. These exemptions, we think, should be made clear to the parliament before the bill is passed. </para><para>While the opposition supports the aims of this bill, the effectiveness of the measures, I think, is questionable. Under the new scheme, it will not be necessary to have your Medicare card to have a prescription filled. It will only be necessary to quote your family's Medicare number and the expiry date of the card. Agents can still collect a prescription if they also know the Medicare card number or at least can quote the same number as appears on the prescription. This measure will not be effective against doctor shopping if there is no data matching. Doctor shopping involves consumers obtaining large quantities of subsidised drugs for recreational drug use, sale for profit, or sending to friends overseas, by presenting prescriptions from different doctors to different pharmacists for the same drug. This bill may not, therefore, make much impact in either controlling use of the PBS by ineligible people or abuse of the PBS by the doctor shoppers. It is, therefore, doubtful that the bill will save the Commonwealth the large amounts of money claimed. This saving might also be offset by the increased costs incurred by implementing these requirements. </para><para>The opposition's privacy concerns relate to whether the mechanism used in this bill, the public exchange of Medicare numbers, is foreshadowing the government's overall approach to medical records and the development of a unique patient identifier by the Health Insurance Commission. So long as health privacy legislation does not exist, it is premature to be introducing a unique patient identifier, and there is every sign that the Medicare number on people's cards has been effectively used in this way under this bill. There are ways to overcome this problem and make sure that each person can have a unique patient identifier that is confidential and does not appear on the card itself. But this requires a lot more thought than the government has given to this issue so far. </para><para>The second privacy concern is how the government will use this information once it has been collected. The bill is unclear about this issue. There are currently specific Privacy Commissioner guidelines about the use of pharmaceutical data and matching with medical benefits data. During briefings, departmental officials have indicated that the data collected based on Medicare numbers will not be matched against existing MBS and PBS data, but there is nothing in the legislation to stop it. There would be problems with this approach, because there are ambiguities about the numbers on cards, and one cannot be sure who the medicine has been purchased for. This point needs to be clarified, and I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary, in reply, could indicate to the Senate how the rules will operate for collecting data based on Medicare numbers and matching this against other HIC data as allowed for by this legislation. </para><para>These measures are being introduced separately from the legislation planned to implement the Better Medication Management Scheme. The BMMS promises to develop an electronic system for patient medication records that can be accessed by doctors, pharmacists and patients. The government has still not properly explained why it is introducing these two e-health schemes separately. The government is, we believe, creating one unique patient identifier to check a patient's eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and has flagged separate legislation to create another identifier to allow doctors, pharmacists and patients to access medication records as part of the Better Medication Management Scheme. Australians are going to have multiple unique patient identifier numbers, and none of them will be covered by a national health privacy regime.  </para><para>Personal health information should not go on line until the rules as to how the information is to be used are properly explained. The transition to electronic health records must be managed sensitively and be accompanied by strong privacy laws. The confusion surrounding unique patient identifiers needs to be cleared up. Government plans for electronic health records and unique patient identifiers need to be very clearly spelt out. As I said at the start, the opposition supports the two primary aims of this bill: to ensure that the subsidised use of pharmaceuticals is available only to those who are eligible and to significantly limit the doctor shopping that is occurring. Whether these measures will have the desired effect, however, is questionable.</para><para>Finally, I wish to move a second reading amendment which will address concerns about the need for transitional arrangements and concerns about how the government is proposing to implement changes to pharmaceutical benefits. I understand that that matter will be considered when we resume debate on the bill later today.

In a ceremony this morning at Parliament House, the Journey of Reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians continued with the passing of the baton from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to the new foundation known as Reconciliation Australia. This significant occasion, witnessed by 300 indigenous and community leaders, saw the culmination of nine years work by the council with the presentation of its final report to the Australian government and the announcement of the board of Reconciliation Australia. The Prime Minister today announced that the proposals contained in that final report would now be considered within a spirit of immense goodwill and a desire to achieve the maximum level of agreement.</para></talk.start><para>The nine directors of Reconciliation Australia are Ms Jackie Huggins, the deputy director of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Unit of the University of Queensland; Mr Mark Leibler, senior partner of Arnold Bloch Leibler in Melbourne; Ms Shelley Reys, managing director of Arrilla Aboriginal Training and Development, Sydney; Mr Dick Estens, chairman, Gwydir Valley Cotton Growers Association; Dr Djiniyini Gondarra, chairman of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress, Nhulunbuy; Mr Campbell Anderson, chairman, Business Council of Australia; the Hon. Fred Chaney, AO, deputy president of the National Native Title Tribunal; Mr Joseph Elu, chairman, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation; and Mr Michael Long, vice-captain of the Essendon Football Club. </para><para>This independent foundation aims to give effect to the council's Australian declaration towards reconciliation. While there will be debate about what form reconciliation should take from here, there can be no doubt about the overwhelming goodwill within the Australian community in support of reconciliation. We have witnessed many events in the nation's capital cities and in rural and remote locations, in places like Bega, Moree and Alice Springs, with public displays of the enormous generosity of spirit between indigenous and non-indigenous people. Most people want better life outcomes for indigenous people, who remain the most disadvantaged group in our society. That is why the Howard government is committed to practical reconciliation initiatives to overcome disadvantage, particularly in the areas of health, housing, education, employment and economic development. I am pleased to inform the Senate that $5.5 million in seed funding will be provided to Reconciliation Australia to ensure that the momentum towards reconciliation continues. The Prime Minister has also announced that donations to Reconciliation Australia will be fully tax deductible from today. </para><para>The government also announced today the site of the proposed Reconciliation Place within the parliamentary triangle in Canberra. Reconciliation Place will, among other things, acknowledge the history of the nation's first people, our shared history and common bonds, the story of the separation of many indigenous children from their families and the significant achievements of indigenous Australians. The design of this national symbolic place will be determined through an open competition which will be announced early in the new year. It will be located on the east-west promenade in the parliamentary zone linking the National Library of Australia and the National Science and Technology Centre on one side to the High Court of Australia and the National Gallery on the other side. We are thus addressing the symbolic as well as the practical.</para><para>Finally, I would like to congratulate the council for its significant contribution to the Australian nation over the past decade.

That has been the same for the Networking the Nation program, which is giving real telecommunications services to country people. It was opposed by the Labor Party at every single stage.

I point out, of course, that under the system we inherited, people who underestimated their income ended up with a debt at the end of the year, but for people who overestimated their income and would have been entitled to more money, there was no provision for that to happen at all. We have now changed the law so that, if you underestimate, you have a debt but, if you overestimate, the taxpayer owes you money. That is a much fairer system. We want to make sure, by providing assistance to families in their first experience—for some of them—of the estimation of their income, that they do not fall into debt.

This joint operation between Dutch authorities and the Australian Federal Police commenced over a year ago. The Australian Federal Police deserve at the very beginning to know that they have the government's congratulations and I would like to think they have that of the parliament as well—but I cannot speak for members on the other side. They successfully foiled the importation of a very large shipment of amphetamines believed to be destined for Australia. Intelligence indicated that a crime syndicate, allegedly arranging to have the drugs sent to Australia, was planning to do so in machinery parts. In a coordinated operation, search warrants were executed, I think the day before yesterday, both in Holland and in Australia. Dutch police have now seized 3,000 kilos of cannabis, 200,000 MDMA tablets, 100 kilos of cannabis resin, nine firearms with ammunition and a large amount of cash. Much of this would have landed on Australian shores had it not been for this operation. A total of 57 premises were searched in Holland and 14 people arrested. The Australian Federal Police executed search warrants on premises in Queensland and Western Australia and, over this operation, have arrested four people and seized over 50 kilograms of MDMA over the past 12 months. The operation was conducted by one of the mobile strike teams funded under the National Illicit Drug Strategy. </para></talk.start><para>Despite our distance from source countries, we are not immune from the operation of these syndicates. To them, borders between countries are simply irrelevant. To beat the crime syndicates, law enforcement agencies are now pooling their resources and intelligence to take the fight right up to the primary organisers of the drug trade. The critical factor for the success of the current operation is the information that was fed back to Holland by the Australian Federal Police following the two major MDMA seizures that occurred in Australia in January this year. I am advised that this information greatly assisted the Dutch authorities. The plain facts are that Australia is now recognised as a major player in the international arena. Equally—and something members of the opposition might like to take into account—as the Federal Police Commissioner says, the Australian Federal Police have never been better funded, never been better resourced. We put the resources into the Australian Federal Police and, in particular, into the international cooperation efforts to fight transnational crime, and we have been reaping the rewards just as other countries have. Countries want to form partnerships with our law enforcement agencies because of their reputation for professionalism and effectiveness. They actually want to form partnerships with us.</para><para>Some other examples that I could go on with would be the arrest of two major Australian based drug traffickers in Hong Kong and the seizure of 20 kilos of ice; the arrest of two people in the United States in possession of 780 kilos of compressed cannabis; the arrest of four major drug traffickers in Malaysia and the seizure of 113 kilograms of methamphetamine and 37 kilograms of precursor chemicals; and the recent operation in Fiji. Two years ago the Prime Minister said that he wanted the Federal Police to become a police force second to none, and I think I can say that we have done it. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Safety</title><page.no>21088</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21088</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Senator Ian Macdonald.

There are certain very serious conditions listed for automatic entitlement to the payment. As Senator Bartlett does know, with cystic fibrosis there is great variation in the impact on the care that is required for those children. Some require much greater care than others and it therefore has to be assessed on a case by case basis; they are just not automatically entitled. I do not seem to have the figures here, but a substantial number of children who have cystic fibrosis have been accepted since the arrangements were changed. I think that, for most people who are looking at it closely—including the paediatric specialists that we consulted during the review—it is believed that the current arrangements are fair. There is, of course, an arrangement where there will be a further review. At this stage, there will not be any speeding up of that. But I do write back to parents in these terms when they have a concern about the matter. They also have the right, of course, like anybody else entitled to social security, to a review of the decision by the original decision maker, a review by the review officer—a senior officer in the department—and, if they feel the need to go further, they have the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the AAT and even the Federal Court. There are plenty of appeals in the process, as you know very well, Senator. I have no intention to be unduly tough on families who are providing care for children with cystic fibrosis, but the fact remains that the advice that comes to us is that you cannot say that all children with cystic fibrosis require the same level of intensive care, which is what the list of automatic acceptance means for this payment. There are a considerable number of children who have been entitled to that allowance since the arrangements were changed.</para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21090</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, the present qualification criteria for carers allowance require that, if the condition is not listed as severe disability, children must suffer a developmental delay before they qualify for the allowance. Surely it is because of the vigilance of parents who provide hours of physiotherapy daily to their children who have cystic fibrosis that these children are not developmentally delayed, even though they may well not live through to adulthood. The concerns continue to be raised by the carers association because of this point. Minister, will you give consideration to the families whose children will die of this condition and acknowledge that cystic fibrosis is a severe disability; at the very least, will you develop special needs criteria for sufferers while you still remain a minister? Is not the point of this that, while people have the opportunity for assessment and appeal through all those processes, given the burden that parents already have, why should they have to go through all these steps to get their entitlement? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21090</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have great sympathy for any parent who is trying to raise a child with a serious disability. But as the senator knows, there are great levels of disability, from minor to profound, with various levels of severity between. It is always going to be difficult for any determination of where the line is drawn. There is not a line anywhere that excludes children with cystic fibrosis from eligibility for this payment. It is decided on a case by case basis. That surely is fair. Senator, you would know, I hope, that the reason children with cystic fibrosis are increasingly not developmentally delayed is that research has shown what early intervention by professionals and by the families can do to achieve a much longer life for these children.

I assure Senator Crossin that, as in all other complaints, the government is acting in the interests of the patients. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>21091</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth-State Cooperation for Protection Against Violence</title><page.no>21091</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Correctional Facilities: Privatisation</title><page.no>21091</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Telecard</title><page.no>21091</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Extradition Detainees</title><page.no>21091</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>21091</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Senator Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a number of answers to questions to incorporate into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.

It has no operational role. The operational elements of the nation-wide counter terrorism capability are provided by the police services or, if the police are unable to deal with a situation, the Defence Force may be called out to assist. SAC-PAV, therefore. has no direct role in either the Sydney Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games or the World Economic Forum. SAC-PAV has supported Games security to the extent of providing some training for police and facilitating several counter terrorism exercises. Security at the Olympic and Paralympic Games is the responsibility of the NSW Police Service and the other State police services in relation to the Olympic football games being played in their States. The Victoria Police are responsible for security at the World Economic Forum.</para></quote><para>—————</para><quote><para>On 30 November 2000, Senator McKiernan asked me a supplementary question about the privatisation of correctional facilities.  In my reply, I stated that I would ask the Attorney-General's Department to some information about past practices in government run prisons.  The Department has provided me with the following examples from the 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons which illustrate where Governments have failed to provide appropriate correctional facilities.</para><para>The 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons found examples of brutal penal methods in Government run prisons. These methods were referred to by Mr Justice Nagle, the Royal Commissioner, as a `regime of terror', and as `...brutal, savage, and sometimes sadistic physical violence'. </para><para>The Royal Commission found that in Grafton Gaol, until 1976, there was systematic beating of prisoners upon their arrival, euphemistically termed a `reception biff'. Three or four officers wielding rubber batons' usually administered the beatings. The Royal Commission also found that prisoners were subjected to extreme violence for days, weeks or on an ongoing basis, where mindless beatings were inflicted for trifling `offences' such as glancing out of the yard in which a prisoner worked.</para><para>In its investigation of Bathurst Gaol the Royal Commission found that the gaol had no glass in the windows and that prisoners spent about 18 hours a day in their cells. Rain and sleet frequently wet prisoners' bedding, and there was no heating in the cells despite the extreme cold experienced in Bathurst. The brutal history of Bathurst included officers' retribution for a sit-in which involved a systematic flogging of a large number, if not all, of the prisoners in the gaol. In 1974, in response to a prison riot, prison officers were issued with arms, and without having been so ordered, began firing on the prisoners. Subsequent medical examinations revealed that approximately twenty prisoners were wounded by gunfire, some of them seriously, with one becoming a paraplegic. The shootings were in direct contravention of instructions from headquarters.</para><para>The Royal Commission identified that these publicly run prisons suffered practices that were `utterly opposed to normal standards of decent human conduct'. </para></quote><para>—————</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner</inline> (Hansard p19850) asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, without notice, on 28 November 2000:</para><para>(1)	Does the minister recall telling the Senate on 12 October that the costs of the AFP investigation into the Reith telecard fraud from May to October totalled $15 440, an average of $3000 a month?</para><para>(2)	Can the minister confirm AFP evidence at estimates last week that the total AFP cost, as at 10 November, had blown out to $72 223? </para><para>(3)	How has this impost on the taxpayer blown out by almost $57000 in less than a month, particularly given that the number of staff on the case seems to be approximately the same as during the five-month period from May to October?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vanstone</inline> - The answer to the honourable senator's question without notice is as follows:</para><para>(1-3)	In my response to Senator Faulkner I indicated that as to the make-up of the costs, I would seek advice from the Federal Police.</para><para>I am advised that the costs incurred as at 10 November 2000 are comprised of:</para><para>$68351.70 for employee expenses which include a total of 746 hours incurred by officers from the Head Office Investigations Team, Southern Operations and AFP London Liaison Office.

Is the Minister also aware that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, requires segregation of convicted and unconvicted prisoners, and that Victoria is the only Australian state which does not provide that facility?  Given that the federal government has the constitutional power to ensure that State governments provide that remand and sentenced prisoners are separated, what is the Minister doing to correct that situation in Victoria?</para><para>As a supplementary question, the honourable Senator asked whether the Commonwealth would consider finding some other place for these detainees to go to, to comply with our international obligations, given that the Extradition Act 1988 does not specify that extradition detainees need to be detained in the state in which they were apprehended.  </para><para>In the course of my answer, I undertook to provide further information.  Additional information in response to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</para><para>The first point is that the two men in question are being held in custody for legitimate law enforcement purposes.  Their custody over the past two years has been ordered and authorised by judicial decisions at various levels.  They remain in custody pending the outcome of challenges under the Extradition Act 1988 (the Act).</para><para>Given the absence of federal prisons, the Commonwealth's extradition legislation utilises State and/or Territory law with respect to the confinement of extradition detainees.  Accordingly, persons detained in Australia under the Act are housed in State and/or Territory facilities and their conditions of custody are essentially matters for State and/or Territory authorities.  The circumstances of the custody of the two Mexican detainees in question at the Port Phillip Prison is therefore a matter for the Victorian authorities.</para><para>I am advised that Australia's international obligation with respect to the segregation of convicted and unconvicted prisoners under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not an absolute one, in view of Australia's reservation that the principle of segregation, while accepted, "is an objective to be achieved progressively".  Accordingly, no clear reason exists for the federal government to consider intervening in the affairs of the State to provide that remand and sentenced prisoners be separated.</para><para>It is not possible for the Commonwealth to move the detainees in the way suggested by the honourable Senator.  I am advised that the Act makes provision for the transfer from one State or Territory to another of extradition detainees before the commencement of extradition eligibility proceedings by a Magistrate, but not after.  In this case, extradition eligibility proceedings in respect of the two Mexican detainees concluded on 17 December 1999 when a Victorian magistrate found both were eligible for extradition to Mexico in respect of all offences for which extradition is sought by Mexico.  While the two men are entitled to exercise (as they currently are) rights of review and appeal under the Act against the Magistrate's eligibility finding, there is no power under the Act to transfer them outside Victoria.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Zambia: Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative</title><page.no>21094</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>21094</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Senator Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have further information in answer to a question that was asked of me by Senator Woodley yesterday relating to Zambia and the HIPC rules.

Of course, we had a look at the DOTARS annual report and found that Quantum had been asked to determine issues that affect regional and rural Australians, feeding into the government's so-called Regional Australia Strategy.

When Senator Hill was asked in question time today whether it was appropriate for a government department to commission research which indicated political party voting intentions, what was Senator Hill's only device to avoid the question? He refused to answer the question. He said the question was hypothetical, therefore he would not answer it. This is worst answer that Senator Hill has given in this parliament since he has been a minister.

This is now becoming stock in trade for this government. This is the Liberal Party after free political information that should be paid for by the political party machine. This is the Mark Textor approach writ large using the department as a stooge.

The reality is that the response I got completely disguised the nature of this report when it finally came to light.

That is why rural and regional estimates hearings go so long. What is interesting is that in the House of Representatives the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, was asked whether he was aware of this report and he said, `No, I have not seen it.' What does this mean? Does this mean Minister Macdonald has actually got the report which he admitted he had today—and in fact he had a brief—and he has not advised Minister Anderson? That is a bit strange. Anyway, the key points of it have permeated through the coalition's election policy. We see the amount of money being poured into Gwydir not just in Roads to Recovery, or `Roads to National Party recovery', but in relation to a whole lot of other things as well. This Minister Macdonald—who has become somewhat of a joke, I have to say, not only on this side of politics—also said that he had released the report. Wrong. He has not released the report.

I will be getting advice in relation to the responses of the public servants, because I do not think they knew about it either. I do not think they understood it either. This is not unusual for this minister. The reality is—and a number of us have been in politics for a very long time—when you do not have a very good minister you just give him a very limited brief and say, `For goodness sake, don't answer any questions.' If you want to be competent in estimates you actually have to have a degree of acuity; you actually have to have some degree of perspicacity. Neither of these attributes can be attributed to Senator Macdonald.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the time remaining to me, let me turn briefly to some of the issues that were raised in this $200,000 Quantum research. Senator Faulkner has already talked about the federal voting intentions in Queensland; it is quite explicit in relation to this. We also have the quote that we used today: a reference to Jeff Kennett realising too late that his credentials were not very good in rural and regional Australia. I do not think that is an appropriate use of taxpayers' funds. We have also got—and this is extraordinary; this is what the government spent $200,000 on:</para><quote><para>We believe that this suggests a risk that Government may become irrelevant in the minds of country people ... </para><para>At this stage, `don't know' response levels to questions are not yet growing significantly which suggests that the frustration and anger have not yet become indifference ...

You could stop anybody in regional Australia where you come from, Madam Deputy President, and they would be able to tell you that, but this government spent $200,000 of taxpayers' money finding out the bleeding obvious. Further, Minister Macdonald did not give this information to Minister Anderson. Now, I know relationships are not terrific between the two ministers, but I would have thought that on something that was relevant to rural and regional Australia he might have slipped him a copy. But he did not. I repeat what Senator Faulkner said: this is a disgrace and I call on the government to publicly table this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>21099</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What the Labor Party seems to be very confused about in relation to this report is its timing.

The article specifically mentioned some AMR Quantum Harris market research undertaken by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. What it did not say, and what apparently was not known by the Labor Party, was that the Department of Transport and Regional Services had been conducting extensive market research since August 1998—that is, pre the Victorian election and certainly prior to Mr Howard's bush trip. The argument that this research was driven by Mr Howard going to the bush was also drawing a pretty long bow. It seems that the Labor Party cannot get their chronology straight on this at all. This research that has been going on since August 1998 was to determine the extent to which rural and regional communities are aware of and know how to access federal government programs. That is a pretty legitimate type of research. You need to be able to target information to rural and regional Australia and people in the bush need to know how they can access services that will be of assistance to them. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The researchers also looked at the most effective media channels for communicating the message. Is there anything new about that, I ask you? Certainly with rural and regional communities there are barriers to effective communication and it is essential that research is conducted to be able to identify what those barriers are and to be able more effectively to help those in rural and regional Australia. To suggest at this stage that the research is somehow or other not a legitimate exercise seems to me to be drawing a very long bow indeed. On the last day of sittings, it is very little more than a diversionary tactic, a fairly typical one that we have come to expect in this place when Labor is otherwise having a bad time wallowing around in a policy vacuum. You have absolutely nowhere to go and nothing else to say, so what do you do? You try to dredge up things. What does the Labor Party do? It tries to dredge up some sort of report and to draw some inferences from it. Well, I do not think it is going to wash.</para><para>The research, when you do look at it, is being used to inform the development of a proper communication campaign for theRegional Australia Strategy. The Regional Australia Strategy, as most in this place would know—if indeed those on the other side have been listening—aims to better coordinate and present public information to regional Australians, to provide better access to Commonwealth programs and to facilitate the two-way process between the Commonwealth government and regional communities. That, in itself, is hardly surprising: that a two-way process actually delivers a better policy.</para><para>Of course, it really does not sit very well for the Labor Party to be criticising the government about its record on administration of regional policies. If you look at Labor's record on administration of regional policies, you now understand why the Labor Party has suddenly decided that there is a great panic to win the bush vote and why you have Country Labor up and running all over the place. Labor's main regional policy, which they crowed about, was called—somewhat amazingly—the Better Cities Program. The Better Cities Program was criticised broadly in many reports, especially by the ANAO. That office criticised the Better Cities Program because it had a lack of measurement of results against any specified outcomes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>21100</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, often says his is not a poll driven government. The document that we obtained yesterday shows not only is he a poll driven Prime Minister; he is sticking the taxpayer with the costs. It is all very well for Senator Hill to take the first part of my question basically on notice today. But in the supplementary he was asked whether it is appropriate for governments to poll for voter intention. What did we get? One of the lamest excuses in history: `Oh, that question is hypothetical. I must obey standing orders and resist any temptation to answer the question.' Senator Hill has led the Liberal Party in this chamber for nine or 10 years and today he was asked to show just a little leadership, and he refused to show any leadership.</para></talk.start><para>If it is okay for governments to poll for voting intentions, then we have set a new low standard in the history of this parliament and the government of Australia. We have a government that spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, many of them covering the dubious boundary of partisan political viewpoint. We have a government that spends millions of dollars on public opinion polling, be it quantitative or qualitative. Let me say for the record that I do not regard it as being illegitimate for the government to use public opinion polling to assist it in coming to policy decisions. But in this instance it is a government in panic. In this instance it is a government that knows it is on the nose in rural areas, so it not only seeks to find out what some of the solutions might be; it also looks to their voting intention. </para><para>Let us have a look at page 6 to see what it says. It is broken into three categories—`Inner Queensland', `Outer Queensland' and `Country Queensland'—and it has across the three categories: `Labor—34 per cent, 39 per cent, 34 per cent'. It has: `Liberal—29 per cent, 18 per cent, 13 per cent.' `The Nationals—5 per cent, 2 per cent'—and cop this one—`Country Queensland, 3 per cent'. It has the Democrats at five per cent in `Inner Queensland', three per cent in `Outer Queensland' and three per cent in `Country Queensland'. One Nation: three per cent in `Inner', eight in `Outer' and a staggering 17 per cent in `Country Queensland'.</para><para>If you want to know why they are doing so well, it is because of the embourgeoised National Party, whose spokesman we heard from earlier in this debate, who surveys rural Victoria from East Melbourne, who is so unbusy in his activities he can lend his brother a staff member for a considerable period of time. The National Party is the problem. You do not need to spend $200,000 to know why the coalition is on the nose in the bush: the National Party is the reason. People are sick of sell-out merchants. They are sick of these weak, spineless National ministers going into cabinet and being rolled. The current Treasurer really should not be paid what he is being paid, because it is just so easy to roll over the Nationals. He can do it in his sleep. He gets up in the morning, he goes into cabinet, gives them a couple of biffs—it is all over. The National Party have sold the bush right out.</para><para>Of course, this sort of surveying has been done in a number of ways. Apart from surveying voter intention, the other trick of this government is to get their lapdog pollster in and give him the work. There is never voter intention in any of his work that is given to government—that is all put in the back pocket and sent on to Robert Menzies House—and Textor, the Liberal Party pollster, has been up to this for years. In some ways I do not really want to put a stop to it because, even though the Liberal Party are getting his polling on the cheap by commissioning government departments to use him, he is such a bozo pollster that we do not really have to worry about him. We actually have to keep him in place, so there is no point in attacking him here. But Senator Hill had a chance today to say whether voter intention polling is a legitimate tool of government. We say we do not think it is. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>21101</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is pleasing that the three Labor speakers who have spoken, Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray and Senator Mackay, are still in the chamber.

The Report makes 30 recommendations relating to the role, function and composition of the National Crime Authority; the reference system; powers and penalties; accountability and parliamentary supervision; and complaints.</para><para>The Government wishes to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee for conducting the evaluation of the National Crime Authority.  Both the Government and the Parliamentary Joint Committee are confident in the ongoing capability of the National Crime Authority to continue its role in the fight against organised crime.   </para><para>While acknowledging the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee and agreeing with many of its recommendations, the Government is of the belief that some of the issues raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee can be achieved by means other than those proposed.  However, the Government will pursue a number of amendments to National Crime Authority Act 1984 where this is necessary to implement the agreed recommendations.  This will result in a more effective and efficient National Crime Authority. </para><para>The recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, together with the Government's response to each recommendation, are set out below:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1: That the National Crime Authority commence regular reporting on a comprehensive range of performance measures so that the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the community will be better able to assess its performance. (para. 1.129)</inline></para><para>The Government is progressing arrangements for improved accountability for Commonwealth departments and agencies generally. It has introduced an accrual budgeting framework and requires government departments and agencies to report on performance indicators and output/outcome measures. All departments and agencies, including the National Crime Authority, have developed performance indicators and output/outcome measures in preparation for this year's budget. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2: That the National Crime Authority's base funding be urgently increased to ensure its ability to work with maximum effectiveness across the full range of organised crime activity.  (para. 1.182)</inline></para><para>The Government is committed to an effective national approach to dealing with organised crime and will continue to support Commonwealth law enforcement agencies appropriately. National Crime Authority funding is a matter for the Government to consider in the budget context. This Government has adopted a supportive approach to the performance of the National Crime Authority. Funds appropriated for the National Crime Authority have included substantial amounts to cover specific projects. Budgets for agencies such as the National Crime Authority generally now comprise one off elements for specific work covering a number of years as well as recurrent funding. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3: That a clear statement of the role of the National Crime Authority be included in the statute as an objects clause.  (para. 2.119)</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the National Crime Authority's role can be further clarified, but this can be done adequately without introduction of an objects clause into the National Crime Authority Act as suggested. The National Crime Authority's role can be expressed in the National Crime Authority Act with clarity and certainty by amendment to existing provisions in the context of the matters raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee in their report.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4: That the area of inquiry of the National Crime Authority reflect that its role is to counter criminal activity which is systematic and complex and which may, but not necessarily, be trans-or multi-jurisdictional.  Where the area of inquiry involves intra-state investigations, such inquiry should only proceed by mutual agreement with the relevant State or Territory and on a fully funded basis. (para. 2.124)</inline></para><para>While the National Crime Authority's role is to counter criminal activity that is systematic and may be multi-jurisdictional, there should be delineation between State or Territory police investigations and investigations carried out by the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority was established as a national agency and where it undertakes investigations within one State or Territory, it does so because that investigation has national significance. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth fund such investigations. It should also be noted that the States and Territories make a significant contribution through the secondment of staff. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5: That the statute be amended to provide that the Inter-Governmental Committee may refer matters for special investigation by the Authority which are framed in broad terms as to the characteristics of the criminality to be investigated.  (para. 3.107)</inline></para><para>The framing of references in broader terms is consistent with the decision of the Federal Court that references may be valid without specifying the offenders, the particular conduct, transactions or the time frame. As the High Court refused leave to appeal from that decision, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to make substantial changes to the provisions of the Act dealing with references. </para><para>The reference model is not intended to be used as a basis for a general investigative power. It is the framework under which the National Crime Authority can use the special powers that are not available to police forces with general investigative powers. Each reference, therefore, requires some factual basis to justify the use of the National Crime Authority's special powers to enable the Inter-Govern-mental Committee to make a decision regarding the use of those powers. There is, however, a problem with current time constraints and it is proposed that the National Crime Authority Act be amended to allow the National Crime Authority to investigate related activity occurring after the date of the reference.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6: That, as a check and accountability measure within the system of broadly framed references, the National Crime Authority must first form the opinion that there is a reason to believe that ordinary investigative methods are unlikely to work before it can invoke its special powers.  This incorporation of the `reason to believe' test into the references scheme is subject to the adequacy of the balances for enhanced scrutiny contained in this report.  (para. 3.107)</inline></para><para>A "reason to believe" test is not required, because under the National Crime Authority Act as it stands, the Inter-Governmental Committee must consider, before approving a reference, whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matter are likely to be effective. Such a test would only be necessary if references were not to be the means of instigating a special investigation. Given the response to recommendation 5, the incorporation of a "reason to believe" test, is unnecessary and could leave the Authority open to costly legal claims of dubious merit.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7: That the National Crime Authority itself, not a Director of Public Prosecutions, should make the decision about whether to indemnify a witness who claims self-incrimination.  To protect against improper use of this power, each such decision must be referred immediately for examination by the Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. (para. 4.72)</inline></para><para>The Government does not agree with the specific recommendation that the National Crime Authority itself not the Director of Public Prosecution should make indemnification decisions. It is not appropriate that a discretionary power to undertake not to prosecute be given to a law enforcement agency. However, the Government agrees with the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the current arrangements allow witnesses to frustrate the investigation process by refusing to cooperate, including asserting that self incrimination means they cannot answer questions. </para><para>The Government believes that there is an alternative solution to the problem identified by the Parliamentary Joint Committee. Amendments will be sought to the sections of the National Crime Authority Act, which provide for undertakings as to use of incriminating evidence. The proposed amendments will provide automatic immunity from use of self incriminating evidence against the witness. The effect would be that, where a person claimed the privilege, they would still be required to give the evidence but it could not be used in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. However, any evidence identified as a result of that answer (derivative use) would be permitted. The provisions will be consistent with those in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8: That no privilege against self-incrimination should attach to summonsed documents.  (para. 4.72)</inline></para><para>The Government supports this recommendation and will seek to clarify this provision because the law has changed fundamentally since the introduction of the Act.  The privilege against self-incrimination applies to statements made by the person claiming privilege.  It also applies to documents that the person is required to produce, but only so far as the documents equate with testimonial evidence.  Consistent with the common law, the privilege against self-incrimination would not apply to the fact of the existence of the documents (but immunity would apply to their contents). </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9: That the application of client legal privilege be clarified.  (para. 4.92)</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with this recommendation.  Subsection 30(3) of the National Crime Authority Act, which preserves legal professional privilege in relation to questions or requests for documents made to a legal practitioner at a hearing, requires clarification in accordance with the law on legal professional privilege.  It is unnecessary to establish expressly all the circumstances in which legal professional privilege applies.  The provisions need only state that the provisions of the Act do not affect the law relating to legal professional privilege.</para><para>It is also proposed to seek repeal of paragraph 29B(2)(e)(i) of the National Crime Authority Act, which provides an exception to the prohibition on disclosure under section 29B for a legal practitioner.  This exception is in addition to a legal professional privilege exception and an exception for the purpose of obtaining legal representation.  Its scope is uncertain and it is anomalous to provide such an exception only to legal practitioners.  A duty arising from a professional relationship such as a contractual or fiduciary obligation of good faith may arise in any professional relationship but no exemption is provided in relation to other professions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10: That the National Crime Authority should be empowered to issue search warrants in narrowly defined circumstances.  Any decision made by the Authority in relation to an application for a search warrant should be notified to the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority as soon as practicable. (para. 4.106)</inline></para><para>The view of the Government is that to allow the National Crime Authority to issue its own search warrants is not appropriate or necessary. It does however, support consideration of a broader approach to the issuing of search warrants (such as the issuing of warrants by magistrates). Any extension of the power of the National Crime Authority in relation to search warrants that extends beyond the powers of police under the Crimes Act 1914 is not supported. </para><para>The Government will also seek to amend the National Crime Authority Act 1984 so that search warrants (and arrest warrants under section 31) include an express stipulation of `reasonable force'. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed concern about the absence of this stipulation in arrest warrants.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11: That the penalties for the offence of money laundering be increased.  (para. 4.119)</inline></para><para>The Government understands the concern of the Parliamentary Joint Committee that the Courts are issuing some manifestly inadequate penalties for the offence of money laundering but it believes that the determination of appropriate penalty is a matter for the Courts. The Commonwealth money laundering offence in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a penalty of $200,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 20 years or both, for a person who engages in money laundering of greater amounts than $200,000. The Government believes such penalties are sufficient. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12: That the penalties for non-compliance with the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be increased.  (para. 4.123)</inline></para><para>It is proposed to seek amendments to the Act so that: failure to attend when required to do so; failure to attend from day to day; refusing or failing to take an oath or affirmation; refusing to answer a question; refusing or failing to produce a document or thing; and contempt will have the same penalty as lying under oath.  The Act currently provides a fine of up to $22,000 or 5 years imprisonment for making false or misleading statements or, if heard summarily, $2,200 or imprisonment for one year.  Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Act delays the hearing process but, in the absence of greater penalties, there is no incentive to comply.  </para><para>In addition to increasing the penalties for the offences listed, the Government also proposes seeking amendments to the Act to give the National Crime Authority a contempt regime.  This regime, which would be broadly based on the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988, would enable the National Crime Authority to apply to a Court to have the Court deal with the contempt as if it were contempt of Court.  This amendment will further support the effective and efficient operations of the National Crime Authority.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13: That, pending the passage of the Commonwealth Criminal Code and as a matter of general guidance of what is considered acceptable, the meaning of `reasonable excuse' under sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 should be defined in the Act.  (para. 4.125)</inline></para><para>The Government will seek to amend the Act so that Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, which deals with criminal responsibility and contains comprehensive general defences, applies to offences under the Act.  The Government will also seek to remove the `reasonable excuse' defence from the offences in the Act, as the Code will require the proof of any mental element for offences as well as providing appropriate defences.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 14: That, given the substantial amendment of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 required to implement the Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations in this report, the Government should rewrite the Act to ensure that Parliament's intentions are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms.  (para. 4.143)</inline></para><para>The Parliamentary Joint Committee's recommendations do not affect the greater part of the National Crime Authority Act. However, in accordance with the Government's policy on statute repair, the Act will be examined during the drafting process of the proposed amendments to ensure that its contents are expressed in clear and unambiguous terms. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15: That, without restricting the manner in which the Authority may regulate the conduct of proceedings at a hearing under section 25 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, where the presiding member has permitted a person to attend a hearing who is not a member of the National Crime Authority's staff, witnesses should be so advised and be able to comment.  (para. 4.154)</inline></para><para>The Government will seek to have this provision amended as recommended, but not so as to give the witness grounds to refuse the presence of the individual.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 16: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should not also be chair of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board.  (para. 5.46)</inline></para><para>The Government intends to initiate a re-examination of this arrangement in the context of the broader issue of Commonwealth law enforcement coordination. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 17: That the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence be recognised in the statute as an advisory body to the National Crime Authority.  (para. 5.52)</inline></para><para>Government is considering, in consultation with the States and Territories, the role and functions of the Standing Committee on Organised Crime and Criminal Intelligence (SCOCCI). It is not appropriate that a body such as SCOCCI, which advises a ministerial committee, be recognised in the National Crime Authority Act.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 18: That sections 51 and 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 be amended to clarify that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has access to all information held by the Authority which is not of a sensitive nature.  (Para. 5.103)</inline></para><para>The Government does not agree with this recommendation. It feels that if an appropriate complaints mechanism is created, there is arguably less reason to give the Parliamentary Joint Committee wider access to information. However, the Government does agree that the Parliamentary Joint Committee could be provided with a greater degree of information provided operational sensitivities are protected. Amendments will therefore be proposed to allow the Parliamentary Joint Committee access to information on completed operations and to Ombudsman reports referred to it by the Minister.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 19: That an Office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority be created, subject to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, to investigate any aspect of the Authority's operations as may be required.  (para. 5.103)</inline></para><para>The Government does not agree with the concept of creating an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority to be subjected to the direction and oversight of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The National Crime Authority is already under the direction and oversight of the Minister and the Inter Governmental Committee. The notion that a Parliamentary Joint Committee supervises a statutory office would be inappropriate in our system of government. No other Parliamentary Committee has such a role.</para><para>Furthermore, the Ombudsman has the role of auditing the interception activities of the AFP and the National Crime Authority under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.  The audit and complaints investigation functions would complement each other, as they do with the AFP. </para><para>The Ombudsman would not be subject to the direction or oversight of the PJC in relation to the investigation of specific complaints, but the PJC would have access to such Ombudsman reports as referred to it by the Minister. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 20: That the Minister be required to table the annual report of the National Crime Authority within 15 sitting days of its receipt.  (para. 5.108)</inline></para><para>Currently the Minister must table the annual report within 15 sitting days of its receipt. The inter-governmental nature of the National Crime Authority requires that the report be circulated to members of the Inter-governmental Committee for comment before it is provided to the Minister. This process naturally takes some time but it is essential given the nature of the National Crime Authority.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 21: That the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be designated as the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority and be given responsibility for overseeing the operations of the National Crime Authority in respect of complaints made against the actions of all its officers, including seconded police.  (para. 6.57)</inline></para><para>The Government does not agree with the concept of an Inspector General of the National Crime Authority. However, the Government does agree that what has existed to date is an unsatisfactory system, with complaints to Ministers, the Parliamentary Joint Committee and police complaint bodies, none of which deals with the totality of the issue. The Government supports the establishment of specific procedures for the investigation of complaints against the National Crime Authority but considers that the Ombudsman should undertake this function. </para><para>That office already has jurisdiction in relation to the Australian Federal Police seconded to the Authority. It is also consistent with the systems of complaints against police in the States and Territories and will facilitate consistent processes for dealing with officers the subject of complaints. Some concern has been expressed that the statutory role of the police commissioners responsible for officers seconded to the Authority may not be adequately recognised. It is proposed that in respect of those officers, the Ombudsman be given jurisdiction to examine complaints against the National Crime Authority, with home jurisdictions to determine appropriate disciplinary action.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 22: That the proposed Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority present details on the outcome of the examination of complaints in relation to the National Crime Authority in an annual report to Parliament. (para. 6.57)</inline></para><para>As outlined in Recommendation 21, the Government intends setting up a complaint mechanism utilising the office of the Ombudsman. The ordinary requirements in relation to reporting by the Ombudsman should apply.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 23: That the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority be a judge.  (para. 7.26)</inline></para><para>The Government notes that under the National Crime Authority Act, a judge may be appointed as Chairperson. None of the powers of Members or the Chair are judicial. The National Crime Authority is an investigatory body, not an adjudicatory body. The Parliamentary Joint Committee recommendation arises from its view that the powers of the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority should be expanded, but the Government does not agree that there should be a significant increase in those powers. A requirement that a judge chair the National Crime Authority would significantly reduce the number of possible candidates with other qualifications necessary to the position including demonstrated management skills. No change should be made to the current qualifications for the Chairperson.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 24: That the provisions of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 in relation to the qualifications of Authority Members be retained. (para. 7.26)</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the recommendation. This provides more flexibility for the appointment of persons with necessary skills.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 25: That the term of membership of the National Crime Authority be four years, with the option for renewal for a maximum of another four years, subject to satisfactory performance.  (para. 7.47)</inline></para><para>The Government proposes to seek amendments to extend the potential maximum term(s) to a total period of 6 years.  This will provide some greater flexibility balanced against the safeguard of terms being capped.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 26: That subject to demonstrating appropriate aptitudes and qualities, a Member should be capable of appointment as Chairperson of the National Crime Authority for four years, subject to the aggregate term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.47)</inline></para><para>Under the National Crime Authority Act, there is currently no barrier to a member being appointed as Chairperson, provided that the member is qualified. The Government agrees that it should be possible for a member to be appointed as Chairperson. The aggregate term should be for no more than six years (see recommendation 25). Legislative amendments to achieve this will be proposed.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 27: That the Government present a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal for a review of the remuneration of the Chairperson and Members of the National Crime Authority in recognition of the substantial changes in their responsibilities arising from the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report. (para.  7.47)</inline></para><para>The Government does not believe the changes it proposes are sufficient to warrant a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal at this time. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 28: That the statute be amended to provide for the appointment of a number of part-time members, who would each serve a term not exceeding eight years.  (para. 7.50)</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the need to increase the number of persons who are able to exercise powers under the Act.  However, the Government does not agree that there is a need for part-time members who would differ from the full-time members only in relation to the nature of their appointment.   To enable the National Crime Authority to operate effectively and efficiently, there should be a number of persons who are specifically empowered to conduct hearings on behalf of the National Crime Authority.  It is, therefore, proposed to seek amendments to the Act to allow for the appointment of an unlimited number of hearing officers whose only function would be to conduct hearings for the National Crime Authority.  Such hearing officers would have all the powers, privileges and immunities of the full-time members of the National Crime Authority when they conduct a hearing, but no other function or role.  Hearing officers would increase the investigative capacity of the National Crime Authority and open appointments to qualified persons who could not otherwise accept a full-time appointment. </para><para>The Governor-General on the recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Committee would appoint the hearing officers for a maximum period of six years.  A number of minor administrative amendments governing leave and conflict of interest will be required.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 29: That attention should be paid to the geographical distribution of National Crime Authority members, with particular reference to Western Australia.  (para. 7.51)</inline></para><para>It is current practice in considering appointments to take account of geographical distribution. The appointment of part-time members should allow for their strategic allocation to ensure that the National Crime Authority maintains an effective national presence.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 30: That the National Crime Authority should employ a small core of staff investigators to complement the existing system of seconded police officers, the emphasis and priorities of this core being a matter for discussion with SCOCCI having regard to the Authority's needs for investigative personnel and the availability of seconded officers.  (para. 7.91)</inline></para><para>This is a management issue to be considered in the context of managing and allocating resources to effectively achieve the National Crime Authority's outcomes. There are complex issues involved in this recommendation, especially those regarding the possibility for corruption, which the Parliamentary Joint Committee in its report acknowledges.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DEPARTMENT OF THE SENATE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21108</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Register of Senior Executive Officers' Interests</title><page.no>21108</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—On behalf of the President, I present notifications of alterations to the Register of Senior Executive Officers' Interests, lodged between 23 June and 4 December 2000.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21108</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>21108</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—On behalf of the President, and in accordance with the usual practice, I table a report of parliamentary committee reports to which the government has not responded within the prescribed period.

On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. </para><para>This list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances, Senator's Interests and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</para><para>Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) primarily make administrative recommendations but may makepolicy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee.

It has been, of course, a slow process and there is still much to do.</para><para>There is much more to building a new state than just replacing the buildings and infrastructure destroyed during the militia rampage after the popular consultation on 30 August 1999.  </para><para>Four hundred years of Portuguese colonialism and 25 years of repressive Indonesian military rule left East Timor with a largely uneducated population, an impoverished economy, considerable health problems and with no experience of a system of government based on the rule of law.</para><para>East Timor is going to need foreign help in many areas, both financial and expertise, for a long time until the East Timorese can be trained to take over all the functions of running a modern state.   </para><para>The Committee believes that it is in Australia's interest for East Timor to become a viable nation; one that does not remain a mendicant state and one that can play a constructive role in regional affairs. </para><para>Timor Gap Treaty</para><para>An important source of income for East Timor will be the royalties arising from the commercial production of oil and gas in the Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation A.  The Timor Gap Treaty, which was negotiated between Australia and Indonesia, provides for a 50:50 split between Australia and East Timor (which replaces Indonesia) in Zone A. The East Timorese are seeking a greater share of the royalties under the Treaty.  Australia and UNTAET, which is acting for East Timor under its United Nations mandate, are currently re-negotiating royalties under the Treaty.</para><para>The Committee believes that Australia should act generously towards East Timor to provide it with the means by which it can develop a society and economy in keeping with the region. The revenues from oil and gas royalties would inevitably become the cornerstone of its future economic and social development.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that, in its negotiations with UNTAET on the future of the Timor Gap Treaty, the Australian Government should take into account current international law in relation to seabed boundaries, the history of our relations with the East Timorese people, the need to develop good bilateral relations with East Timor and the need for East Timor to have sources of income that might reduce dependency on foreign aid.</para><para>Human Rights Abuses in East Timor</para><para>The East Timorese people have suffered gross human rights abuse at the hands of the Indonesian military and militias throughout the period of Indonesian rule.  The massive violence and destruction of property that occurred after the 30 August 1999 ballot drew international support for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the perpetrators of the violence.  Indonesia objected to international interference into what it regarded as its sovereign responsibility and has been carrying out investigations of it own.</para><para>The Committee believes that justice should prevail, whether it is carried out by Indonesia, East Timor or by an international tribunal. Given the difficulties of getting hold of Indonesian suspects residing in Indonesia, it is preferable to let justice take its course through the Indonesian justice system. If, on completion of that process, the international community remained dissatisfied with the outcome, it should press for the establishment of an international tribunal to instigate its own proceedings against alleged perpetrators of the violence.</para><para>Australian policy towards East Timor</para><para>As required by its terms of reference, the Committee examined Australian policy towards East Timor, mainly from about 1974 onwards. However, as made clear at the beginning of the inquiry, the Committee did not examine the matter of the deaths of five Australian and British journalists at Balibo in October 1975.</para><para>It is easy to understand why many people thought that incorporation into Indonesia was the best solution for Portuguese Timor in 1975. The Portuguese had not prepared the Timorese for independence, the economy very small and most Timorese outside Dili and the larger towns were subsistence farmers. Timor would have been very dependent on foreign aid for a long time. Moreover, Apodeti members preferred some association with Indonesia while the two main parties, Fretilin and UDT fought a bloody civil war. The left-leaning Fretilin was of great security concern to Indonesia, which was very anti-communist, in case Fretilin attracted external communist involvement and support. Internationally, there was support of incorporation of Portuguese Timor into Indonesia. </para><para>It is always difficult, even in hindsight, to establish whether a different policy approach would have achieved a significantly different outcome. It is clear that Ministers and public servants generally agreed that Portuguese Timor should have been incorporated into Indonesia.</para><para>Mr Whitlam appeared, particularly in 1974, to take the view that the outcome was more important than the process. His comment to officers that `I am in favour of incorporation but obeisance is to be made to self-determination' supports that view. This approach was watered down to some extent in early 1975. Others, such as Senator Don Willesee, consistently gave greater emphasis to the process of self-determination than the outcome.</para><para>Through the whole period from April 1974 to the fall of the Whitlam government in November 1975, not once was the future of Portuguese Timor referred to Cabinet for consideration. </para><para>At the time of the Yogyakarta meeting in September 1974, it appears that President Soeharto was still diffident about incorporating Portuguese Timor in Indonesia. </para><para>A strong Australian position in favour of self-determination might have bolstered the non-interventionist element in the Soeharto administration as opposed to military elements that supported Indonesian action to effect incorporation.  </para><para>Even if that happened, there was no guarantee that the non-interventionist position could have withstood the events of 1975 in Portuguese Timor, that is, Fretilin and UDT calling for independence and the civil war between the two, as well as allegations of communist sympathies on the part of Fretilin. </para><para>When, on 17 August 1975, the Australian Ambassador to Jakarta, Mr Woolcott, sent his oft-quoted cable to Canberra arguing in favour of pragmatism rather than principle, it was probably too late for Australia to have changed the course of events. </para><para>East Timor has been a thorn in the side of Australia's relationship with Indonesia since incorporation. </para><para>Ever since the mid-1970s, there has been a thread running through East Timor policies of Australian Governments of all political persuasions: that greater emphasis should be placed on relations with Indonesia at the expense of East Timor. </para><para>Until the latter part of 1999, all governments have publicly played down reports of human rights abuses in the territory. They were prepared to accept Indonesian Government assurances and explanations at face value, and support them, even in the face of contradictory evidence. </para><para>The East Timorese people, having been colonised by the Portuguese, had a different heritage to the rest of the Indonesian people. Having had a taste of freedom in 1975, they were not prepared to accept Indonesian rule and, hence, their prolonged resistance. The brutal military regime that controlled East Timor over the next 25 years only served to reinforce their desire to throw off the Indonesian yoke. </para><para>Once almost 80 per cent of East Timorese cast their votes for independence, despite severe intimidation by pro-Indonesian militias, aided and abetted by the Indonesian military, the TNI, that act of self-determination rendered continued Indonesian control of East Timor unsustainable. </para><para>The subsequent horrendous violence and destruction wreaked on East Timor by the militias and the TNI made international military intervention an inevitable and pressing requirement. </para><para>The denial of self-determination to the East Timorese people in 1975 has now been rectified, albeit at a huge cost for both the East Timorese people and Indonesia. </para><para>Ironically, when, ultimately, Australia was forced by circumstances to change its policy towards East Timor, it was blamed by Indonesia for its loss of East Timor, resulting in a downgrading of the bilateral relationship, which Australia's earlier disingenuous policy towards the territory had been aimed at propping up.</para><para>Defence Co-operation with Indonesia</para><para>On 10 September 1999, the Government announced a review of the defence relationship with Indonesia because of the events in Indonesia, as a result of which there was a significant scaling back across a wide range of activity.  However, some staff college level exchanges and educational activities continued.</para><para>As it was the Indonesian military that sponsored the violence that occurred in September 1999, and had earlier been responsible for the many human rights abuses perpetrated over 25 years of Indonesian rule of East Timor, the question of defence co-operation became a sensitive issue in the inquiry.</para><para>The Committee believes that Australia has the capacity to assist the TNI become a professional force but until there is a clear indication that the TNI is prepared to move in that direction, Australia should not countenance renewing the defence co-operation program. </para><para>The Committee believes that before any additional defence co-operation measures are undertaken there must be a resolution of the refugee problem in West Timor and the neutralisation of the East Timorese militias, including prevention of their incursions into East Timor. </para><para>There must also be clear evidence that the TNI is dismantling the territorial command structure throughout Indonesia and that it is becoming a professional defence force rather than mainly an internal security force. </para><para>It has been the territorial command structure that has given the TNI the power to meddle in domestic matters both nationally and right down to village levels, and given rise to gross human rights abuses perpetrated in East Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia. </para><para>As Indonesia now has a democratic system, albeit in a fragile state, it would be anathema for Australia to support the TNI or any other element in Indonesia not working to strengthen democracy. </para><para>Relations with Indonesia</para><para>Undoubtedly, Australia's role in East Timor's independence has had a deleterious effect on relations between Australia and Indonesia. Some Indonesians still blame Australia for the loss of East Timor. Relations with Indonesia have remained strained.   </para><para>As close neighbours, the Committee believes, and re-affirms, that it is in the long-term interests of both Australia and Indonesia to develop a strong and enduring relationship. However, there is little point in being precipitate in trying to form a new relationship until there is a readiness on both sides to embrace one. Given Indonesia's loss of East Timor and the enormity of the political changes that have occurred since the downfall of President Soeharto, it is not surprising that there are many uncertainties in Indonesia at the moment. These domestic tensions have not been conducive to rebuilding relations with Australia. However, in time, the mutuality of interests should bring about a rapprochement in relations.</para><para>As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade pointed out during the inquiry, not all levels of the relationship have suffered the significant downturn experienced at the political level. The Department should continue to shore up support at these working levels as a basis for improving political relations in due course. It should also try to maintain trade and people-to-people contacts between the two countries.</para><para>The Australian Government and Parliament need to keep in touch with public opinion across the spectrum of Indonesian society. In the Committee's Interim Report of 30 September 1999, the Committee recommended a visit to Indonesia by an Australian parliamentary delegation to discuss issues of importance to both sides with Indonesian parliamentarians. Such a visit has not yet taken place. The Committee reiterates its call for such a visit and recommends that overtures be made to the Indonesian Parliament to seek their agreement to it.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21118</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I joined the committee late in relation to this inquiry into East Timor. I want to refer particularly to chapter 6 of the report, which essentially deals with the period of the Whitlam government and the Whitlam government's dealings on East Timor with Indonesia and our other allies. In some circles in Australia, former Prime Minister Whitlam has been often accused unfairly of being a willing and compliant collaborator with the Indonesian government when East Timor was invaded in December 1975. As you and I know, Madam Deputy President, Mr Whitlam has denied strenuously in print and in person before the committee that he gave a green light for the Indonesians to proceed. Mr Whitlam maintained, and provided evidence of the fact, that he had publicly and privately communicated to the Indonesian government that he was, as his government was, in favour of self-determination for the people of then Portuguese Timor.</para></talk.start><para>I might say, for the purposes of historical perspective, that it was a very worrying time throughout the world, particularly for people of a social democratic point of view. During the period Mr Whitlam was in power, we saw in a number of areas in the world an increase in the victories of people from the extreme left. It was with a great deal of concern that people observed the goings on in other parts of the world. In Portugal itself, which had been for some decades under a fascist dictatorship, a combination of socialists and communists came to power via certain young army officers. At that same time as the Spinola government was deposed, the situation was inevitably starting to deteriorate in East Timor. I might add that Mr Whitlam made a speech to the United Nations in September 1974 in which he declared his desire to see the end of Portuguese colonialism. It was not long after that that the new Portuguese foreign minister met with Mr Suharto in Jakarta and expressed—and this is a socialist foreign minister—to the Indonesians at that meeting that in fact East Timor should be incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia. It was at the same time that the North Vietnamese politburo decided to breach its peace accord and invade South Vietnam.</para><para>Whilst this situation was occurring in our region, our government, Mr Whitlam in particular, was trying to ensure that the ALP's policy of self-determination was directly, publicly and privately, communicated to the Indonesian government. As we know from history, in January 1975 the independence parties of UDT and Fretilin formed a coalition, which deteriorated later in the year. It broke down and a full-scale civil war began in August of that year. The Fretilin movement was aided by the fact that, when the Portuguese authorities left Dili and went to a ship offshore, they left behind thousands of guns and other bits of ammunition so that the movement would be able to have some advantage over the other parties in at least the prosecution of this civil war. </para><para>I recall at the time being concerned, as were many Australians, that, with the developments that were occurring in the world, we might have been witnessing on our own shores another Cuba. It was with that concern that former Prime Minister Whitlam conducted our foreign policy, seeking to make sure that our allies were up to date on the expression of our views. I was not then and am not now a fan of Fretilin. I am very suspicious of them, and I will continue to be suspicious of them until such time as I think their motives can be, at least historically, flushed out.</para><para>I do not want to say too much more on the report. It was a comprehensive report that the officers of the committee put themselves tirelessly to the task of preparing. All I will say in conclusion is that there was at the time a great deal of chaos and instability, not only in our region but also in Lisbon, which led to the December 1975 invasion by Indonesia. There was a lot of political instability in our own country, as we recall. I believe—and Mr Whitlam still testifies to this—that Mr Whitlam conducted himself with great honour and great diligence as our Prime Minister, and I believe that he is wrongly vilified by certain sections of the community for what they see as his attitude to that terrible period for Australian foreign policy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title><type>Delegation Reports</type><page.no>21119</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary Delegation to Brazil and Argentina</title><page.no>21119</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21119</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I table and present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Brazil and Argentina, which took place from 15 to 29 October 2000.

The Sub-Committee had also visited Brazil and Argentina as part of visit to South America earlier in the year. Their report provided a focus for the Delegation who was able to progress issues by reinforcing findings and emphasising recommendations during its meetings.</para><para>The Delegation found that an important issue in the relationship between Australia and Brazil and Argentina is simply a need for greater awareness of the respective regions and their potential.</para><para>Brazil and Argentina have not previously been an area of great focus - Both our regions have looked more to Europe and North America, and in Australia's case recently to Asia. We must now also look across the Pacific.</para><para>Australia's profile benefited greatly by the success of the Olympic Games. Complimentary comments relating to the Olympics were constantly made to the Delegation in both countries. The Delegation believes that the value of the Olympics in raising awareness of Australia can not be under-estimated and provides a window of opportunity that must not be missed for realising trade and investment potential and maximising tourism potential.</para><para>The Delegation was able to gain an insight into the economic and political situation in both countries. Economic recovery is occurring after the recession of the late 1990's, with Brazil particularly surging ahead. Significant economic restructuring has been occurring during the 1990s and governments in both countries have introduced strong fiscal measures.</para><para>Politically, constitutional democracy is now well entrenched in both countries. Argentina voted for a change of government in 1999 and while it currently is undergoing some political disputation, events are easily being controlled within the democratic system. In early October, Brazil held nationwide local government elections with a massive turnout of voters.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Meetings with key governmental figures</inline></para><para>The Delegation had the honour of meeting with Vice-President Maciel in Brazil and Acting President Losada in Argentina, with Ministers and many Senators and Deputies from each Congress. The enthusiasm with which the Delegation was received and the constructive dialogue at these meetings has contributed significantly in developing and strengthening the links between our respective Parliaments and the bilateral relationship with each country.</para><para>Many issues were discussed at the various meetings with these key governmental figures and these are outlined in detail in the Delegation's report. They included benefits of exchanges - particularly in parliamentary, educational, scientific and business areas; trade and investment; foreign relations and multilateral issues; agriculture and mining.</para><para>In Argentina, the Delegation also had the opportunity of raising a number of finance and taxation issues with Ministers and Committees of Congress that were causing concern for a number of Australian companies. The companies had discussed these concerns with the Delegation at earlier meetings.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Trade and Investment opportunity</inline></para><para>Trade and investment opportunities in Brazil and Argentina abound. At virtually every meeting and inspection the Delegation was able to discuss an area of opportunity and the mutual benefits that could accrue. Areas of immediate potential arising from the Delegation's meetings and discussions include:</para></quote><para>·	mining exploration and development,</para><para>·	oil and gas especially from significant recent privatisation,</para><para>·	agribusiness in many fields is receptive to new and innovative technologies,</para><para>·	information technology and telecommunications,</para><para>·	education services especially in tertiary, postgraduate and distance education, and </para><quote><para>aquaculture and viticulture.</para><para>These, together with other areas of opportunity, are also discussed in detail in the report.</para><para>Tourism offers huge potential, especially with Qantas commencing direct return flights to Buenos Aires in 1998. Tourism is very much a two-way thing with numbers coming from Brazil increasing significantly in recent years. The Delegation attended a joint Australian and New Zealand tourism promotion that showcased the potential on this side of the Pacific.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Particular highlights of the visit</inline></para><para>The Delegation's program for the visit was both interesting and diverse, allowing it to gain a broad insight into a wide range of activities, including:</para></quote><para>·	Seeing and understanding the electronic voting system operative in Brazil. The system had been successfully used for Brazil's recent nationwide local government elections.</para><quote><para>Visiting an ethanol plant and synchrotron light technology laboratory in</para><para>Sao Paulo State,</para><para>Seeing the successful introduction of Australian polymer technology being used for Brazilian banknotes,</para><para>Meeting and discussing with representatives from Australian companies about their experiences in successfully establishing and investing in Brazil and Argentina. Companies the Delegation met with included BHP, MIM/North, P&amp;O, Village Cinemas, Qantas.</para><para>Observing a cattle auction at the Liniers cattle market and gaining an understanding of the size and scope of the beef industry in Argentina,</para><para>Learning of the breadth of agricultural research undertaken in Brazil and Argentina and of the many close links and collaborations with Australian researchers.</para><para>The Delegation visited INVAP at Bariloche. INVAP is the company that was awarded the contract for the design and construction of the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. It is also involved in a range of business activities in other fields including, the development and construction of scientific satellites, the design and production of high-technology medical equipment, and industrial and other projects including high speed data transmission by satellite.</para><para>The Delegation was pleased to be able to inspect the facilities of INVAP's space laboratory and observed work being undertaken on construction of their next satellite due for launching later this year and its payload of a multispectral camera. We also visited the RA-6 research reactor.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Acknowledgments</inline></para><para>Many people contribute to make a Delegation's visit a success. The report lists and thanks a range of people who contributed to the overwhelming success of our visit to Brazil and Argentina. However, a number of people are worthy of particular acknowledgment.</para><para>Ambassadors Garry Conroy in Brasil and Sharyn Minahan in Argentina, and Trade Commissioner Gerard Seeber in Sao Paulo assisted the Delegation with comprehensive briefings and invaluable support and assistance. In addition, the staff of the Embassies in Brasilia and Buenos Aires, and at the Austrade office in Sao Paulo, also provided great assistance especially Edward Sellars, Sarah Roberts and Radek Divis. </para><para>The professionalism and commitment of the Ambassadors and their staff was particularly evident to the Delegation. Australia can be very proud that it has representatives of this calibre who will be involved in realising the opportunities and potential that exists between Australia and Brazil and Argentina.</para></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>21121</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>21121</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>21121</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

I would like to give the committee some idea of the terms of reference of the research that we have been referring to recently as it underpins the Regional Australia Summit and therefore resulted in the Roads to Recovery legislation that is before us. I will read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the terms of reference of Quantum Market Research:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Undertake research and market testing of branding elements to be used for the <inline font-style="italic">Regional Australia Summit </inline>response package in regional Australia. The consultant was also required to concept test proposed text, graphics, logos and taglines and provide an indication of the effectiveness of these elements in achieving communication objectives. This research fed into the overall regional Australia campaign and helped define the communication approach, particularly promotional tools, mechanisms and target audiences.</para></quote><para>We heard about that today. It continues:</para><quote><para>It also enabled the Department to improve its understanding of regional perception and attitudes and to communicate the government's programs and services appropriately. Staff with relevant expertise were not available in the Department.</para></quote><para>And thus Quantum Market Research were given the tender. The minister came in earlier and cited a letter he had received from Quantum saying that they had not undertaken any research in relation to the research on page 13 of the report, which goes into very detailed information, or on page 6, which talks specifically about Queensland. In the introduction on page 1, Quantum have said that the findings are drawn from a number of sources—inter alia, Australia Scan. If you turn to the table which was referred to in question time today, it is headed `Federal election voting intentions: Australia Scan'. If you go to the appendix to this suppressed report, it makes it quite clear that Quantum used Australia Scan to conduct the research that we have referred to:</para><quote><para>Australia Scan is a research service which Quantum Research has used to keep their finger on the pulse of what is going on in the hearts and minds of Australians.</para></quote><para>Clearly, in relation to the minister's previous contribution, I hope that he does have the intestinal fortitude, in his contribution to this bill, to correct the record in terms of what seemed to be an inadvertent—maybe he had not read the appendices or the full report; certainly Minister Anderson does not seem to have been given a copy—misleading of the Senate. I hope he is now in a position to change that.</para><para>Going directly to the bill, I want to ask the minister a number of questions and also put a number of issues on the record in relation to a somewhat misleading second reading contribution from the minister. First of all, I go to the issue of interstate distribution, which is totally critical to exactly where the potential for pork-barrelling is in this bill. There is a clear difference between how the government has used the funds and how they were previously distributed under the Labor formula of 1991—I think the minister said 1994, but it was in fact 1991. In terms of the interstate distribution, the funding is provided over the period 2000-01 to 2004-05 and was determined in a two-stage process. The minister has discretion over the timing of payments to local government authorities over the four years. </para><para>The first stage was the interstate allocation of the $1.2 billion. The government has applied a new formula to these allocations. Despite repeated attempts to seek answers from Minister Macdonald, the only information available on the new formula is the assertion that it is based on road length and population and has been adjusted using unspecified factors—an issue which I traversed extensively in my contribution in the second reading debate. The existing allocation formula—that is, the 1991 formula—used for the identified roads components of financial assistance grants to local government has applied since that period; that is, the financial year 1990-91. The new Roads to Recovery Program allocation formula will apply only for the purpose of this bill.</para><para>I have a table which shows the impact of the Roads to Recovery Program formula relative to the existing Labor 1991 identified roads component of FAGs. For example, under the old 1991 Labor formula, the Northern Territory would have achieved 3.2 per cent. Under this new formula—and `new' is not my word; it is the word of Minister Macdonald—the Northern Territory has 1.6 per cent of the available money. In the minister's home state, we have another major disparity. Under the old Labor Party formula of 1991, Queensland would have got 18.7 per cent of the total funding available. Under this formula, they have 20.9 per cent. So here we have clear differences in relation to the two formulas.</para><para>In answer to my direct question `Is it a new formula?', Minister Macdonald, somewhat uncharacteristically in relation to estimates, gave us the answer yes. I would appreciate more answers like that from Senator Ian Macdonald. I repeat that the question was: is it a new formula? Minister Macdonald said yes. As I said before, you cannot get any more emphatic than that. I also asked him about how this new formula worked—and this is the real extent of the government's fiddling with the formula. He said that the interstate distribution of funds was based on a formula involving 50 per cent road length and 50 per cent population. So far so good; but he then admitted that the formula was—and I quote from the estimates—`adjusted to get a fair and equitable result'. When further questioned on the basis for these adjustments, the minister would say only that they were undertaken by the government and were solely a govern-ment decision.</para><para>As late as yesterday, we had the Prime Minister asserting in a radio interview on 6PR that the formula was Labor's formula, but this is just not correct, as provided by Minister Anderson and admitted by Minister Macdonald. Today, we have a <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> circulated from the Parliamentary Library confirming what is already obvious. Perhaps the minister will sit up and pay attention as the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> makes a comment on the minister's method of adjustment to this new formula. It states:</para><quote><para>When questioned about the adjustment, the Senator—</para></quote><para>that is, Senator Ian Macdonald—</para><quote><para>replied it was based on `the judgements people make'.</para></quote><para>You can almost see the raised eyebrows in the Parliamentary Library at that pearl of wisdom. The digest confirms the variations to the historic state allocation percentages that I have outlined previously. The digest also makes a number of other observations:</para><quote><para>Clause 7 requires the Minister to make conditions relating to the payment of funds under the Bill. It is not clear whether the text of these conditions must be published in the Gazette. ... Presumably they are to be published ... but as a matter of drafting this could be spelt out clearly, as for example is the requirement for publishing a funding list under clause 5. </para></quote><para>This is an excellent example, identified by the Parliamentary Library, of our assertion that this is a rushed and sloppy preparation in relation to this bill. The digest's concluding question is:</para><quote><para>Does the Bill allow the Commonwealth to influence the choice of roadworks to be funded?</para></quote><para>It notes that the opposition already has evidence of members on the other side ringing local councils, attempting to lobby them and so on, and it notes that: </para><quote><para>... although it is not required by the Bill, the Commonwealth has said that:</para><para>Local government bodies must ... provide the Minister with a proposal for the expenditure of their grant.</para></quote><para>That is from the second reading speech of the minister. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> concludes:</para><quote><para>... it is clear that there is no limitation on his or her—</para></quote><para>that is, the minister's—</para><quote><para>discretion as to timing and amount of individual instalments, provided that all funds are paid by 1 July 2005.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>There is no impediment to the Minister taking a position, for example ... he or she will not release any funds until 2005.</para></quote><para>Exactly. The drafting of this bill does not secure adherence to the spirit of its intention. Further, again from the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>:</para><quote><para>The fact that under clause 7 the Minister is similarly unrestricted in his or her power to make funding conditions, could also in theory give the Minister some influence but since these would presumably apply to all local governments, they would be of general application and not capable of targeting particular projects or proposals.</para></quote><para>So what we have is a general catch-all phrase by which the minister can exercise considerable discretion. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest </inline>also<inline font-style="italic"></inline>makes the point that this is a move away from financial assistance grants—that is, untied agreements—to specific purpose payments—that is, tied payments. I would like some response from the minister before I go on to the next issue that I would like to raise, so at this point I will conclude my remarks and seek some response from the minister in relation to those issues and some clarification in relation to the provisions that have been raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>21123</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will ignore all of the vicious personal attacks that Senator Mackay has again made on me in the guise of asking questions.

The formula used for this allocation is based on the current state grants commission formula used for the distribution of the identified road component of FAGs.

It is very clear what the intrastate formula is. It is the states grants commission's formula for distributing the untied road identified grants of the financial assistance grants act. That act was introduced by the previous Labor government, supported by the then opposition, and has been actioned by each state government—most of which, regrettably, are Labor state governments. They appoint states grants commissions which then determine a fair and equitable formula for the distribution of moneys to each and every council within a state. That formula, which has been used for almost 10 years now, is the formula used for distribution of moneys intrastate under this bill.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>21125</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I notice, yet again, that the minister refuses to answer questions relating to the Deputy Prime Minister's press release on this bill. I do not think he will answer, so we will leave it at that and go to another issue. The bill requires the minister to gazette conditions that apply to the payment of the grants. These conditions are of three types. I will just run through this so the minister can be up to speed in relation to it. Section 7(2) sets out the conditions that must be included. It requires the money to be used for roads and be properly accounted for, that councils maintain their levels of other road expenditure and that signs be displayed in relation to projects funded under the act. Section 7(3) sets out conditions that may be included: conditions requiring councils to repay amounts to the Commonwealth in the event of a breach of the conditions and conditions requiring the council to comply with the guidelines issued under the act. Section 7(4) provides that sections 7(2) and (3) do not limit matters that may be dealt with in the conditions. Section 7(5) gives the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. This section appears contrary to the description in the explanatory memorandum that states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In varying any conditions, the Minister will have to ensure that the compulsory conditions in subclause(2) are maintained. </para></quote><para>Minister, clarification of this section is required. In its current form, it gives the minister unfettered power to change all conditions for the allocation of funds. We believe—and I would like your comments in relation to this and, obviously, the Parliamentary Library would as well—that this bill provides for, in effect, the introduction of tied grants of specific purpose payments. We believe this is a retrograde step and will provide capacity for Minister Anderson to potentially interfere with local road funding priorities.</para><para>But I come back to the section in the bill that I would like a response to; that is, section 7(5), which is at variance with the other sections—sections 7(2), 7(3) and 7(4). What precisely is meant by this section? Our contention is that it gives the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. In fact, it is very clear in the legislation that that is what is meant by that section. Minister, I would appreciate it if you could provide a response to that matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>21126</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator, I did not understand the part of your question that dealt with specific purpose payments or tied grants. If you want to pursue that, please ask your question again when I finish answering this. The minister may, by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> revoke or vary any of the conditions. That is in subsection (5) of section 7. That, of course, means what it says: that the minister is able to revoke or vary any of the conditions that are referred to. I would assume the legal interpretation—and I will get some advice on this; my legal knowledge is now 10 years rusty—would be that there must remain conditions that require the money to be used for roads expenditure. But I assume the precise wording of those conditions can be revoked or varied by the minister and would then have to be replaced by other conditions that require that the money be used for roads expenditure and, similarly, conditions that require that the expenditure be properly accounted for. I assume that subsection (5) means that, initially, the minister may say, `You have to account by getting in the state auditor-general to account for it.' He may then at a later stage say, `That hasn't been practical, so I'll vary that by deleting reference to the state auditor-general and require, for example, the Commonwealth Auditor-General to account for the expenditure.' That is how I would interpret subsection (5).</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>21126</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that, Minister. I would repeat that my final question was in relation to the fact that section 75 seems to give the minister the power to vary or revoke any of the conditions by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>, and I look forward to clarification on that. I think you have essentially confirmed that, however. I will move on to some other questions on which we would like a response and which are based on representations made to us by a number of councils. I know that Senator Hutchins and Senator O'Brien made similar comments in relation to representations they have received, and I have certainly received the same representations. Minister, will local government be able to draw on funds for the preparation of strategic plans for their local government roads projects? It has been put to me by a number of councils that the reporting mechanisms will represent a significant imposition, particularly in relation to small councils. It is worth noting—and I notice that Senator Hutchins raised this yesterday—that the government seems quite content for funds to be spent on signage that highlights the government's involvement, but councils have put to us that they are concerned about the real administrative costs in relation to it.</para></talk.start><para>While you are thinking about that, Minister, will you also answer the question of whether local government will be able to draw on RTR funds for the additional financial imposition of funding applications and annual reporting? It has been put to us that this is also a significant impost on small regional councils. Minister, how much flexibility is local government going to have to request a staggered payment or lump sum payment of funds? For example, if a particular council wants to undertake a planning study of local roads needs in their area over a 12-month period, will they be able to roll over year one funding into subsequent years? I will leave it at that and come back to other questions later.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21126</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We respect and understand local governments. The whole purpose of this bill and this initiative from the Howard government is to get money to councils for use in upgrading and maintaining local roads. We have made a massive commitment of $1.2 billion, and we want to see it happen. We think local governments are the best people to get this work done efficiently and expeditiously, and everything we do follows that intention. Why would we do otherwise? We have committed the money and we have distributed it in the most fair and open way possible, one that has been universally applauded by local government—and I stress `universally applauded'—because local government understand the formulas, they understand how fair they are, they know they have been working on those for years and they are amused that some people involved in this debate yesterday simply did not seem to understand how things currently work. But that is fair enough; I will leave that. </para></talk.start><para>The only real condition we have on this whole thing is that the funds must be spent on roads. Under the current act, I will call it the Labor act, the 1994 act, the moneys the Commonwealth gives to local authorities are identified as roads grants. They are calculated on a formula that the state grants commission relates to roads. But, having received the money, the councils can then spend it on anything. They can spend it on a publicity unit or a social worker or whatever, and that is the way that act is set out; we are not trying to change that. But with the Roads to Recovery Program, we are insisting that the funds be spent on roads. To do that, we are asking councils very reasonably to explain to us what they are going to do. These conditions have not been put together yet, but I think we will be saying to councils, `We want to know what you were going to do before this money came along, and we want to know what new or different things you are going to do or what things you are going to bring forward,' just so that we can be assured that they are not cost shifting and transferring some money that they were going to spend on local roads to another program and then using this money to do what they intended to do anyhow. So the conditions will relate to that.</para><para>Senator Mackay asked about the timing of the payments. The act provides that the amount be payable in one or more instalments and that the amounts and timing of the instalments are to be determined by the minister. We have indicated publicly that we want to get out the first instalment in February if it is at all possible. We have indicated that it will probably be a quarter of an annual payment that will go out in February. We have also indicated—and I think the bill says—that, where there are only small amounts involved, we can pay the total amount in full, up-front. But we want to help local government, and we will work with local government, to get that money out in the very best way possible. We will continue the excellent working relationship we have with both the Australian local government executive, its president and vice presidents, and the state local government associations with whom we work very cooperatively and well. We will be working with them to make sure we get this money out in the best possible way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21127</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that, Minister.

The bill contains a condition outlining the needs for signage acknowledging the government's financial support. What criteria and guidelines have been issued for the signs required to be displayed at works funded from the new program? Will funding be withdrawn if these signs are not displayed? How much will each sign cost and how much has been allocated in the program to cover signage?</para></talk.start><para>I had a very interesting meeting with a Victorian council, the Macedon Ranges Council. On Tuesday, 5 December, I met with the mayor, Councillor Noel Harvey, and the CEO, Lydia Wilson, to discuss roads, petrol and other related issues. They provided a number of interesting points in relation to the situation facing Macedon council. These points inter alia have been raised with us by a number of councils, but it does provide a good snapshot of some of the difficulties. The information that they provided us was that Macedon council has seen the cost of sealing and asphalt tenders rise by around 40 per cent. Of this 40 per cent, companies are attributing a 30 per cent rise to increased fuel costs based on the petroleum levels in the bitumen products used. The council advised me that the average bitumen reseal rate has increased from $1.75 per square metre to $2.35 per square metre. Due to the increased sealing costs, Macedon will be forced to reduce the percentage of resealed roads from five per cent to 3.7 per cent. This is in the context of the council's targeted reseal percentage of 18 per cent. Their contention is that there will be a budget shortfall of approximately $130,000 in 2000-01 for Macedon shire council. As a result, council's annual RTR allocation of approximately $1 million will be reduced by about $130,000 due to the increased petrol costs and the consequential increase in the cost of bitumen, leaving a revised yearly total of $870,000 before even considering new projects. </para><para>The question that they were keen to pursue is whether the government would allow the council to wait until such time as petrol prices reduce, thus allowing them time to get a better deal, particularly on bitumen. They also said that the cost of running the council's car fleet has risen by $30,000, obviously excluding costs associated with heavy plant.</para><para>Finally, the council raised some quite legitimate concerns about competition in any tendering process for roads, based on the limited number of contractors with the ability to provide the service. A senator made the point yesterday about rural and regional Australia. This council in particular has two contractors they can use. This is a major roll-out of infrastructure, and they are concerned to ensure that fairness is entrenched in the contracting process because, with such an amount of money being available, there is a possibility that costs will go up over a short period. This certainly happened pre-GST with the building industry, where we saw a consequential fall.</para><para>We suggest—and I will be interested in your response, Minister—that this is an issue that the government could refer to the ACCC for some kind of watching brief. Obviously across all states a small number of contractors, particularly in rural Australia, will stand to benefit from the injection of funds through the RTR program. The opposition believe it is something for which the ACCC could be given a watching brief. This is obviously within the bailiwick of the Treasurer, so I ask the minister whether he would be prepared to take this up with Mr Costello and give the ACCC some kind of watching brief in relation to the issue of contractors.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21128</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suggest to Senator Mackay that if she wants answers to specific questions, which obviously she does, she should ask them one at a time.

I must say in passing that I am pleased to note that Senator Mackay recognises that petrol prices will fall, because at some stage the world crude oil price will fall—I do not know when that will be, and perhaps it is a brave thing to say—and the exchange rate will vary. Senator Mackay knows as well as I do that the price of fuel is directly related to those, and that is what it is all about. I agree with Senator Mackay; I think they will fall. On the issue of whether councils can delay, this is really a program that councils will run. All we want them to do is to spend money on much needed road works. Their programs are already in place, and they have this additional money. They have plenty of work to do. We know that, and they know that. Within reason, it is a matter for them if they choose to delay it a bit and hope to pick the world crude oil price. It is really up to them as to how they get the best value for their money. I think you will find that there is such a desperate need for road works around Australia that they will take their chances and do it as quickly as they can. But the choice, within reason, is theirs.</para><para>I think you made the point that, because world crude oil prices are high and the exchange rate bad, their current budgets for road funds are some way over the budgeted amount and they will have a shortfall in their current budget expenditure. If you were asking whether they can use this money to fill in their budget, the answer is quite clearly no. This is for new road works, so it is quite clearly no. If this program were not here, they would have to manage it some other way. Two weeks ago, this program was not here. This is new money for new works—additional works that we know all councils desperately want. </para><para>You raised the question about signposts. The conditions on signposting will be interpreted very flexibly as it is likely in many cases the works will be distributed over a number of geographical areas. The councils will be asked to give assurances, and the CEO will be required to certify that this condition has been complied with. The cost of the signs will be funded by the councils, which can use the Roads to Recovery program funds for this purpose if they wish to do it that way. It is normal practice for all authorities, including local governments, to signpost capital works in this way. Senator Mackay will be aware that all of the works done by state governments—certainly in works that are done under the Roads of National Importance program, the Black Spots program, the national highways program and the state arterial roads programs that all of the state governments run—are signposted. This will be no different from those. In fact, my experience as I move around the country—and I know from my own council's experience—is that they are all signposted in any case.

It works, in essence, by establishing an arrangement where doctors and other prescribers must write the patient's Medicare number on each prescription.  </para><para>The Government has also attached to this bill a range of amendments seeking to change the composition and terms of office of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (the PBAC).  I'll discuss those measures later because I'd like to spend most of my time considering the principal part of this legislation.</para><para>The main measures of this bill are designed to tighten eligibility for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Scheme costs the Government $3 billion a year and is one of its most successful programs. Through its operation, the Government pays about 82 per cent of the cost of listed drugs. </para><para>More than 500 different medicines are covered by the scheme. About 129 million prescriptions are issued through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme each year.</para><para>Both claims and payments under the scheme are administered by the Health Insurance Commission, which is also the body responsible for administering claims and payments of Medicare benefits.</para><para>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the scheme to our health system. The Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme is one of the most crucial elements of our health system. We must be extremely careful about any changes we make to the current system, even if those changes are only at the very edges.</para><para>Considering the cost, size and importance of the scheme it is essential that we ensure only eligible people receive benefits. Eligibility is confined to residents of Australia and to visitors from the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Malta, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, where we have reciprocal health agreements.</para><para>The measures in this bill would make it more difficult for ineligible people such as overseas visitors and people who have non-resident status to obtain drugs at a subsidised rate.</para><para>When fully implemented, the Government will not pay pharmacists unless they have checked the person's Medicare number and expiry date before dispensing a prescription. Furthermore, if the number is not correct when compared to Health Insurance Commission data, pharmacists will be responsible for tracking down the customer in order to correct or verify the actual Medicare number. </para><para>The Bill allows doctors and pharmacists to retain Medicare numbers for future use with the same patients. It does also require them to maintain privacy and obtain the consent of patients regarding the retention of the numbers. </para><para>The legislation establishes various penalties for misusing or disclosing Medicare numbers. There are provisions allowing the correction of numbers during the phase-in but after that, the rules become quite a bit stricter.</para><para>The complexity of Medicare eligibility has made the proposal quite detailed. It includes a range of measures to provide for exceptions, the details of which will be spelt out fully in regulations. </para><para>There are a number of groups of people who do not have Medicare cards but who are eligible for pharmaceutical benefits - including people with disabilities in the care of others, visitors from countries with which Australia has a bilateral agreement and people without a card in an emergency. </para><para>There has been general support from all parties for the objective of ensuring people don't get pharmaceuticals they aren't eligible for. There is some concern however, particularly from pharmacists and consumers about several aspects of the scheme. </para><para>The major concern regards the mandatory requirement for Medicare numbers to be put on prescriptions. Some people are particularly concerned that the Government has put the cart before the horse by effectively using the Medicare number as a "unique patient identifier" without putting an adequate privacy regime in place first. </para><para>The Bill allows doctors and pharmacists to keep Medicare numbers and prohibits their misuse. We support this as a means to protect privacy but we will have to look closely in the future to ensure that any further expansion of the powers do not raise more privacy concerns.</para><para>The Bill also does not clarify to what purpose the data collected by the Health Insurance Commission can be used. There are currently specific Privacy Commissioner Guidelines about using pharmaceutical data and matching it with Medicare numbers. There is a case for the guidelines to be reviewed but any review needs to occur in the context of a national approach to health privacy.</para><para>This legislation forms part of the Government's overall plan for health medication. The Government has foreshadowed further legislation to implement other aspects of its overall plan and says that further privacy measures will be dealt with at that stage. We welcome the commitment to ensuring the privacy of patient's medical records. </para><para>We do have some concerns about some practical aspects of this scheme and whether it will achieve its intended objective. It will not be necessary to have your Medicare card to get a prescription filled. It will only be necessary to quote your family's Medicare number and the expiry date of the card. Agents can still collect your prescription if they also know your Medicare card or at least can quote the same number on the top of the prescription.</para><para>There is the distinct possibility that this will leave open most of the currently used methods for ineligible people to obtain a prescription and have it filled. Those methods include borrowing a card, using a stolen card or impersonating another person. Given concerns recently about the various numbers on particular cards being used inappropriately, one wonders how safe this measure would be.</para><para>The problem of "doctor shopping", that is - obtaining multiple scripts for the same complaint, will not be solved by this measure.</para><para>The Health Insurance Commission estimates that in 1998-99 more than 8000 people were engaged in doctor shopping, costing an average of $21.68 for each prescription filled. The measures in this bill however, will do little to stop doctor shopping. People will not need their Medicare card to get medication. They will only have to quote the number and the expiry date. </para><para>People who are ineligible will be able to access pharmaceuticals in exactly the same way they did before this legislation was suggested—they could impersonate someone they knew or borrow or steal a card.</para><para>The central issue of this bill revolves around privacy and fraud prevention. How is the Government planning to use the Medicare numbers it collects under the new system? Will they use that data to curb doctor shopping? If they do that, how will they then deal with the various privacy concerns? </para><para>Unfortunately the Government seems to be willing to use Medicare numbers as unique patient identifiers without first establishing the all-important privacy regime.</para><para>Several practical difficulties also arise because currently a number of family members can share the same Medicare card number. The records held by the HIC will show the total use by all the people on the card and this could possibly lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn about the appropriateness of any pattern of use. </para><para>Labor's alternative would be to use a unique patient identifier system based on the Medicare card, which would avoid several of the difficulties inherent in the Government's approach. Patients would each have a separate number instead of one per family and there would be a separation between the number used for claims and the patient identifier used to connect health records. </para><para>Many pharmacists also have major concerns that they will carry the penalty for any incorrect information being supplied to the HIC about prescriptions issued.</para><para>There is a lot of concern about the timing of these measures. Pharmacy and doctor groups do not believe that this time frame is realistic and would like to see it moved back at least six months. These are legitimate concerns, especially when you look at the small amount of publicity the Government has undertaken with regard to this measure.</para><para>Currently it is proposed to implement the policy in three stages, with full mandatory observance, being required by July next year. </para><para>Stage 1 establishes the privacy regime and gives explicit permission for Medicare numbers to be collected, placed on prescriptions and stored. This stage comes into effect as soon as the legislation is given assent.</para><para>Stage 2 of the bill requires that Medicare numbers be collected and put on prescription by pharmacists and other suppliers for the purpose of identifying entitlements to pharmaceutical benefits. Currently the Government plans to have that stage apply from January 1 next year, less than 16 working days away.</para><para>The third and final stage applies from July 1. It actually prevents payments to pharmacists or other suppliers in relation to dispensing prescriptions for pharmaceutical benefits if there has been a failure to comply with stage 2 of the process or where the number endorsed on a prescription does not match the number registered at the Health Insurance Commission.</para><para>That is an extraordinarily short time frame, especially when you consider the extra amendments included. I'd like to know a few things about the education campaign the Government is implementing to warn people about the possible introductions of these measures.</para><para>I'd like to know what consultation and feedback the Government has had from pharmacists, who will shoulder the job of implementing most of these measures. </para><para>What is the Government telling the public about the changes? What information is the Government disseminating in the lead-up to this change? </para><para>I'm sure it is reasonable for the Government to wait until the legislation actually passes before initiating a full publicity campaign. But they are running pretty close to the wind. </para><para>We're less than a month away from the startup. And, given the understandable lethargy of these sorts of things over Christmas, I don't imagine much will be happening between when we pass the legislation and January 1.</para><para>The reality is that if we pass this legislation as it stands, from January 1 the public will have to provide pharmacists with their Medicare number as well as their prescription in order to verify that they are eligible to receive their full PBS benefit. </para><para>If the patient cannot do that, they will be forced to either pay the full cost of the medicine or go back home and get their number and go back to the pharmacist and present their prescription for a second time.</para><para>I imagine there will be a lot of confused and annoyed people out there when this measure is put in place.</para><para>I also want to discuss briefly the proposed changes to the composition and terms of members of the PBAC that the Government is presenting. The PBAC is responsible for assessing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals and deciding whether a particular pharmaceutical should be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>Under the changes a health economist would be added to the current Committee membership of up to three general practitioners, one community pharmacist, one consumer representative and one clinical pharmacologist.</para><para>The changes also propose that each member of the PBAC for a term of not more four years and for a continuous period of up to eight years. No member would be reappointed if it resulted in them serving for a total of more than 12 years.</para><para>In addition the chair of the Committee may not be appointed for more than eight years. The final proposal is that any period a person who is a member of the current Committee, should be treated as a period during which the person was a member of the new committee.</para><para>It is this proposal that has caused serious concern for senior members of the current committee, as well as various academics and some clinicians. It is perceived that this measure is a way of dropping certain members of the committee, thus weakening its independence.</para><para>We would like to have more time to consider these changes. They are quite major changes and should not be hurried through. We would like more time to negotiate a balanced approach to these changes. In our opinion, this process has been rushed.</para><para>In conclusion let me reiterate our support of the general thrust of this Bill. It is a reasonable approach to a problem that does need addressing. That support we have shown however, does not come without any concerns. </para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the pillars of our public health system. We need to take measures to ensure its integrity. But while doing that we need to make it clear to everyone that uses it that any information that we collect from it will be used properly.</para><para>The Labor Party wants to see a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that reduces fraud and works effectively. In doing that however, we must ensure that it does not come at the expense of privacy.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>21132</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I comment on the <inline ref="R1153">National Health Amendment (Improved Monitoring of Entitlements to Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2000</inline>, I want to discuss a related issue—a general health issue—and to remind the Senate that this morning the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation handed over the document <inline font-style="italic">Declaration towards reconciliation </inline>to the government and that the council will now hand over its role to Reconciliation Australia. One of the issues raised this morning was practical reconciliation. What more practical reconciliation can we have than adequate funding of the health system so that at the federal level Aboriginal Australians can enjoy the same level of funding as non-Aboriginal Australians. Again, I want to put on the record findings from research by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. I think the findings speak for themselves, because it is from Commonwealth funds that primary health care dollars come. The states put in what I guess could be described as the `acute end' by the time you end up in one of their hospitals. For every Medicare dollar spent on non-indigenous Australians, the records and information show us that only 27c is spent on an Aboriginal Australian. For every Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dollar accessed by non-indigenous Australians, indigenous Australians access 22c, and for specialist treatment it is 12 cents in the dollar for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I acknowledge there are a number of other Commonwealth programs, including the Aboriginal community health care programs; but, if you add it all up, the Commonwealth puts in 67 cents in the dollar for every non-indigenous Australian—in other words, we get a dollar; they get 67c when, in fact, looking at their health needs, it should be about $1.20. </para></talk.start><para>I wanted to make those points and support the comments made by Senator Crossin this morning relating to the education bill that went through this place earlier today. There again we see the way in which this government sorts out its priorities—tens of millions of dollars spent on the very wealthy end of the private school system when Aboriginal children do not get an opportunity to even go to secondary school. We are not talking about highly remote communities with small populations; we are talking about primary schools with 200, 250, 300 or 500 kids with no secondary school for them to go on to. </para><para>Coming back to the bill in front of us, we support the thrust of this legislation and are pleased to see that the government has removed the more contentious points in it and now hopefully will have a rapid passage through this place. We support the inclusion of Medicare numbers on prescriptions for pharmaceuticals under the PBS. The PBS is a scheme that stands us in good stead with any scheme anywhere in the world. We have one of the best schemes for Australians as far as access to medications is concerned. If you look at the health systems in other countries, you will see that medicines are so expensive in places like the USA that treatable illnesses often get to the point where people die from them due to not being able to afford the drugs that they need. So we do need to protect the PBS, and it is a protective measure to include the Medicare numbers on prescriptions. There is evidence that people doctor shop for a range of reasons—some simply because they have an addiction to a particular form of medication but others because they want access to cheap drugs in order to onsell them. So being able to track in this way will hopefully reduce any misuse of the PBS and see us further able to protect the health of Australians.</para><para>I also wish to note that the government's amendments which make minor changes to the composition of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee are also supported, and this is where the controversial measures disappear from and, as I said, we are pleased to see that. We support some of the amendments at least. I wait with interest to hear the debate on the opposition's amendments. But broadening the base from which recommendations can be taken, I think, is a good idea. Currently, only the AMA is able to make recommendations to the minister for vacancies. I think it is quite appropriate that we broaden this to include the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and others. We will deal with this as we get to the amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>21133</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators for the contributions they have made to this important debate and indicate that the <inline ref="R1153">National Health Amendment (Improved Monitoring of Entitlements to Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2000</inline> is in two parts.

I think there has been some negotiation with the government about accepting those. Before going into a lengthy explanation of the intent of the amendments, perhaps Senator Tambling is in a better position than I am to explain where we are at in terms of the government's position. That might truncate the debate. The ALP amendments effectively seek to be a bit more prescriptive than the government's to retain the link between the nominations to the committee and the recognised professional bodies.</para><para>Under the government's amendments, we were concerned that the link between the professional bodies and the nomination process has been removed. We think that has been one of the strengths of the system and I think that was noted in the report of Senator Tambling's review of the PBS. We think, therefore, that that is worth retaining. The government's original position seems to provide too much flexibility for the minister. Given the intense political pressures that are applied in terms of this committee, we think that is unwise. As I say, we think that the link between the professional bodies nominating for the committee is a good one and that the minister's discretionary power ought to be limited to three of the 12 positions rather than the larger number that it would be under the government's amendments. In general, we looked to be a bit more prescriptive—to retain the prescriptive practices contained in the original act—and that is why our amendments are directed towards that end.

I remind the chamber that, by the time we return next year in the second week in February, there will have been a further increase in fuel prices as a result of the GST. Either way, the result of the tax application to fuel will be a reduction of 2c a litre in the price of petrol next year if the inflationary spike is removed. Instead, motorists are facing a further breaking of the Prime Minister's word that the GST would not affect the price of fuel in this country. There will be a further breaking of the Prime Minister's word in February next year before the parliament resumes. I will be moving a second reading amendment to enable senators to vote on this important issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The federal parliamentary Labor Party's caucus committee, the petrol price inquiry, has travelled to 23 different locations throughout Australia to hear evidence from community organisations, transport operators, service station operators and local councils—amongst many others—about the unfairness of the impact of the new tax system on fuel costs. These are the same Australians who pay more in petrol tax because their petrol prices are higher. These people have not been fooled by the government's attempt to return only some of its windfall gain on local roads. Of course, Australian motorists deserve more than road funding from this government: it cut road funding in 1996 by hundreds of millions of dollars. Page 3-156 of Budget Paper No. 1 of the 1996-97 budget shows just one decision—`reduction in national highway system funding'—with over $620 million of funding cut out in that year and in the three subsequent years. So the government is not really increasing road funding; it is just putting back some of the funding that it cut out some years ago, but it is taking a massive petrol tax windfall off motorists. </para><para>These motorists have been speaking to Labor's fuel price inquiry. They are telling us that what they want is lower petrol prices, because the Liberal and National parties, particularly the Prime Minister, refuse to listen to them, have refused an inquiry into the issue and refuse to honour the broken promise, the absolute commitment that the Prime Minister made, that fuel prices would not rise. They are aware, as the government appears not to be, that this broken petrol promise is making life all that harder. We have heard from a number of peak motoring organisations at our hearings. It is also important to note, as we approach the Christmas-New Year break, that this is a peak travel time for motorists.

They attempt to make names for themselves back in their electorates but they do not do anything about the issue. We will be moving a second reading amendment this afternoon. It says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>"... the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households and calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001".</para></quote><para>This will be the Senate's last opportunity to express its concern on this issue, which is the priority issue of policy concern amongst Australians at the present time.</para><para>I move to the issue of the GST in some further detail. We have heard many times from the government that it would simplify the tax system. The Treasurer in his press release of 13 August 1998 stated:</para><quote><para>The introduction of the Australian Business Number, coupled with the simpler and more flexible payment arrangements, will substantially reduce the number of dealings business has with the Australian Tax Office.</para></quote><para>The overwhelming majority of Australians, and certainly small business, know that that is simply not true. It is just fantasy. If you talk to anyone in small business at the present time, battling their way through the business activity statement and gritting their teeth, they will tell you it is very far from simple and is very costly to administer. Prior to the introduction of the GST, we heard a lot about simplification. But with this legislation comes at least an acknowledgment from the government that its GST and associated tax changes have instead made the tax system much more complex for small business. Some of the more significant changes in this bill allow the tax commissioner in certain circumstances to cancel an entity's GST registration, it allows the tax commissioner in certain circumstances to change an entity's tax period from monthly to quarterly and it gives the commissioner the ability to pay out a refund from a business activity statement rather than to take it off current or future tax liabilities such as company tax. These changes should not really be counted as benefits for business but rather are removing what is, frankly, the absolute idiocy of the earlier arrangements. </para><para>There are some 48 other changes, plus numerous minor technical corrections. This is a lot of simplification, it is a lot of roll-back, but Labor support this simplification because of the numerous complaints we have had from small businesses who have been unwittingly caught up in the web of administrative problems created by the new tax system. For example, this bill will finally provide an escape clause to those who are not only tearing their hair out over the business activity statement because they were erroneously registered for the GST but who must pay GST even though their prices have not increased. According to the president of the National Tax and Accountants Association, Ray Regan, the GST is effectively coming directly from the pockets of many small businesses and it will likely bankrupt them because of the significant impact on cash flow.  </para><para>The Tax Ombudsman has received complaints about this issue. In fact, she has had about 80 complaints about the ABN and the GST registration process. She has reported:</para><quote><para>Many complaints relate to timeliness, while others come from people who have experienced difficulty getting the ATO to remedy processing errors. For example, some entities were registered for GST when they had not asked to be. However, this bill does not provide for retrospective cancellation of GST registration. </para></quote><para>This is puzzling to the Labor opposition, and we would certainly like an explanation from the minister when he comes to the chamber on why it is not retrospective. Ray Regan is concerned that, as many businesses have decided to play it safe by registering for the GST and erring on the side of caution, they are now unnecessarily plagued by the business activity statement and its attendant complexities. I might say that many registered in order to play it safe because we had not had the complete package of legislation relating to the GST in the parliament prior to the 1 July start-up. As I said in my opening remarks, with the amendments we are dealing with in respect of the GST in this legislation, the total now comes to 1,650 amendments, six months after the introduction of the GST. These businesses should not be punished for attempting to do the right thing. That is why the amendment to the legislation in respect of registration should be made retrospective. </para><para>This bill also proposes to amend the law to enable the commissioner to ensure that a business activity statement refund is not automatically offset against a current or future tax debt. Currently this situation is causing considerable problems for business. Acting on the current law, the tax office has reduced GST refunds for businesses by deducting company tax bills even when they have not fallen due. This should not occur. It creates cash flow problems for small businesses and the potential for prolonged interaction with the tax office to find out what has happened to the GST refund. One case I have been made aware of concerns a small business which submitted a business activity statement on 21 August and was entitled to a GST refund in the order of $92,000. The subsequent advice from the tax office was that the refund was put into the owner's account. However, on checking with his bank he discovered that the refund was reduced by $12,000, and he was left to find this out for himself. On checking with the tax office, he discovered that the tax office had taken his company tax out of his anticipated refund. Unfortunately, he had already separately payed his company tax bill. It has now been paid twice. This is a ridiculous situation. It should not have been allowed to occur, and with the passage of this bill it should not occur again.</para><para>There is also an administrative change with regard to the monthly BAS. This involves increasing flexibility to cancel monthly remittances of the GST. As things stand, people cannot change from monthly to quarterly until they have completed 12 months as monthly remitters. Again, this is a ridiculous situation, and the bill will fix that. However, the quarterly system itself is still not a simple one. In fact, its complexity led to the deadline being extended. The National Tax and Accountants Association conducted a comprehensive survey of accountants and tax agents and over 2,000 accountants responded. It showed that an estimated 400,000 BAS returns will fail to meet the extended deadline. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses cannot cope with the BAS, and in the wake of this survey the tax office has extended the deadline further. Of course, they did not even recognise the problem raised by Mr Regan and have just quietly extended the deadline by around three weeks. People still miss the deadline; indeed, there will be many who have still not lodged. </para><para>The first quarterly payment was such a disaster that the second payment, which had already been granted a two-week extension until early February, has now had that deadline extended until the end of the month of February. So the so-called smooth implementation of the GST is just a bad joke and a very bad taste in the mouths of many small businesses and their accountants. Although this legislation addresses some GST related problems, there continue to be many more. Obviously Labor are happy to support removing some of the GST problems. This is roll-back. This is roll-back by the Liberal and National parties, and in particular Treasurer Costello. And we support this roll-back. It is a logical thing to do and it is consistent with Labor's pledge to make the GST simply and fairer. </para><para>I notice that National Party Senators Boswell and McGauran scuttled out of the chamber when I referred to their appalling record on fuel prices in this country. The National Party have been trampled on by the Liberal Party in respect of this issue. I just want to give a couple of examples to the chamber before I move the second reading amendment. We did a survey of coalition senators. I am disappointed that Senator McGauran is not here. The survey was conducted of unleaded petrol and LPG prices, and this is from the Shell web site as of today. Senator McGauran has recently, after a prolonged period of 10 years, moved his office from Collins Street in Melbourne to the country—he does represent rural Victoria—to Benalla. In Benalla today unleaded petrol was 99.9c with a GST component of 9.08c. That is compared to Melbourne, where unleaded petrol is 91c and the GST is 8.27c. In Benalla, where Senator McGauran has suddenly decided to relocate, liquefied petroleum gas is 59.9c and the GST is 5.45c. That illustrates the enormous impact and the differential in respect of petrol prices in rural and regional areas and the city.</para><para>In New South Wales, which Senator Sandy Macdonald represents, in Tamworth West LPG is 56c and the GST component is 5.09c. In Sydney today the price of LPG varies, but it is around the low fifties. In Townsville, which Senator Ian Macdonald represents, unleaded petrol is 93.9 cents and the GST is 8.54c. In Rockhampton unleaded petrol is 92.2c and the GST is 8.38c. In Brisbane unleaded petrol is 81.2c and the GST is 7.38c. So that illustrates again the significant disadvantage that people in rural and regional Australia are suffering. They are suffering as a result of the GST. A percentage tax on a higher base rate leads to a widening of the differential and is a significant disadvantage to people in rural and regional Australia. In my home state of Tasmania, which Senator Newman also represents, in Launceston unleaded petrol is 101.5c today and the GST component is 9.23c. Senator Watson is also in Launceston. In Hobart unleaded petrol is 97.4 cents. That just again illustrates the major city and rural and regional divide. The National Party, of course, have done nothing for rural and regional Australia in respect of petrol.</para><para>I have to make a comment about the Australian Democrats' position on this legislation. Of course, they are responsible for the GST, along with the Liberal-National Party. I did read your minority report, Senator Murray, on the taxation laws amendment bill. Senator Murray describes the situation that has resulted and the problems that have emerged in respect of the GST as `mischief'. He says:</para><quote><para>The mischief that the amendment seeks to remedy is the situation where a parent entity claims an input tax ...</para></quote><para>I must say, Senator Murray, that for you and the Australian Democrats to describe the problems of the GST as mere mischief just understates the horrors that small business are experiencing in respect of the GST.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—It's a mischievous comment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—It is a mischievous comment, that is right.

We were referring to one amendment in there and one amendment only. Let me move from that to the bill in substance. The <inline ref="R1168">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2000</inline> includes amendments to 14 different acts which cover a wide range of activities. The vast bulk of the provisions in this bill are non-controversial. I do note that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill, as they do support the GST and as they will support the GST when they go to the election, because they are certainly not going to repeal it.</para></talk.start><para>One of the more significant amendments in the bill is the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to cancel an entity's GST registration where it has applied to the commissioner for cancellation before it has been registered for 12 months. My understanding is that that is a much desired amendment by small business and not-for-profits which have registered for GST purposes only to realise that they would have been better off staying out of the system and being input taxed.</para><para>This bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at the behest of the Democrats, and I would like to briefly discuss a couple of the issues raised in the submissions and during the hearings. We decided to refer the bill to the committee after receiving representations from the Association of Heads of Australian University Colleges and Halls. That organisation was concerned about the impact of a very innocuous looking amendment in schedule 6 of the bill. That amendment has the effect of applying an associate's test to the non-profit subentity provisions of the GST act.</para><para>The concept of a non-profit subentity was established to allow non-profit organisations—churches, schools, sporting clubs—to identify separate parts of their businesses as separate entities for GST purposes, even if those parts of the businesses were not separately incorporated. The purpose of deeming the entity as separate for GST purposes was to allow it to avoid the compliance burden of being a part of the registered entity. It was thought that the non-profit subentity would then be input taxed just like any other unregistered small business. The problem which has arisen is a scenario in which the parent entity—that is, the main club or school—purchases goods or services, pays GST to the supplier, claims the input tax credit based on the supply but gives those goods and services to the subentity, which then takes them out of the GST system. The ability of the parent entity to claim the input tax credit means that no GST has effectively been paid, but the subentity can on-sell the goods without charging GST. The amendments in this bill would require parent entities to value all gifts to non-profit subentities and to remit GST based on those values.</para><para>An example of the problem that the bill is trying to remedy would be as follows. The local school purchases uniforms and pays GST. It claims the input tax credits and gives the uniforms to the school shop. The school shop is a non-profit subentity, and the shop sells the uniforms to students effectively GST free. Item 18 of schedule 6 to this bill will apply an associates test to the parent entity—the school; and the subentity—the shop. Division 72 of the GST act deals with associates and provides rules which ensure that supplies without consideration to an entity's associates attract the GST and that supplies to an entity's associates for inadequate consideration are properly valued for GST purposes. The provision of new section 72-92 will result in supplies between non-profit subentities, or between a non-profit subentity and its parent entity or association with the parent entity, for a nil consideration or a consideration substantially below market value, therefore attracting GST. Therefore, parent entities will be required to put a value on every supply provided for less than its full market value or for nil consideration to and between its non-profit subentities and to account for the GST. </para><para>There are two issues here. The first is the actual GST that would need to be remitted. That is not the major concern because, by and large, the revenue involved is relatively small. The sorts of examples that were given were things like allowing the use of meeting rooms and providing free use of photocopying and computer facilities. I do not envisage that the amount of GST on those sorts of transactions would be substantial, and the tax office could not confirm in our committee hearing that at that level they would be substantial. The second issue is, of course, compliance and the fact that this amendment will mandate the recording of all these often quite minor transactions with bodies that are often not commercial in nature. We are concerned about that compliance problem. One of the suggested partial solutions to the compliance problem was to alter the amendment to only catch the direct resale to the public of goods and services that are being gifted by or transferred at undervalue by the parent to the non-profit subentity. The problem with that solution is that it does not deal with the scenario where the parent entity purchases goods or services, claims input tax credits and gives those goods or services to the subentity, which then uses the goods or services to produce other goods. That would leave a reasonable gap in the law which we believe could be exploited.</para><para>The amendment that I will be moving when we reach the committee stage will have the effect of allowing a parent entity to make gifts to non-profit subentities to a limit of $5,000 per subentity each year. It is our hope that the threshold provided by the amendment would allow the ordinary run-of-the-mill operations of not-for-profit organisations to continue without there being a necessity to record and account for things like the use of meeting rooms. The amount of $5,000 was roughly derived by us to allow for about 20 meetings each year in meeting venues in central city locations—I know that it is an arbitrary figure, but that is how we arrived at it. I am thinking specifically of church synod offices, and I am advised that that would cover large numbers of these subentities and would serve to remove these activities from the parent's business activity statement preparation. </para><para>I regret that the government will not, I understand, be supporting this amendment, and I regret that the opposition will probably not be supporting the amendment either. The amendment would have the effect of alleviating some of the burden of compliance that item 18 of schedule 6 will unnecessarily generate. It is a great pity that the amendment will probably be lost, despite the fact that it is one with low revenue consequences but very high compliance cost benefits through reductions in compliance costs. On this issue, the government is adopting an unnecessarily harsh and inflexible approach encouraged by the tax office. The Democrats and the not-for-profit sector represented at the hearing acknowledge the problem that the government is trying to remedy and that the tax office is concerned about, but we think we have found a reasonably simple way of alleviating the compliance burden which avoids creating a gaping hole through which tax revenue could escape.</para><para>The other issue raised before the Senate economics committee was the application of the goods and services tax to food supplied to boarding school students. Although it was raised at the hearing, it is not really part of the bill, but I draw attention to it because it was raised at the hearing. While it is not an issue raised directly by the bill, a couple of submitters to the inquiry raised the issue of GST applying to food supplied to children at boarding schools. At present, unless those supplies of food are subsumed in accommodation—which is GST free in schools—those supplies are ordinary taxable supplies and attract GST in the same way as restaurant or take-away prepared food. The simple question is: should food supplied to students in primary or secondary boarding schools be GST free or not?</para><para>There are a number of arguments for and against making food supplied in boarding schools GST free. In brief, the arguments for GST-free treatment are as follows. Food is GST free in hospitals, community and aged care centres and child-care centres—in other words, in institutions; education is GST free in philosophical and principle terms; and basic food is GST free. Therefore, food supplied as an integral part of providing education should be GST free. If the children did not board at school, the parents would be able to provide them with food purchased GST free and then prepared at home. The revenue forgone is low—it is only approximately $1.5 million per annum. The only significant argument in favour of applying the GST to such supplies is that the food provided is prepared food by definition—that is the GST versus no GST distinction—and it therefore follows that it should be consistently applied to boarding schools. </para><para>The issue has apparently arisen because of a change to draft guidelines issued by the ATO. The original guidelines stated that food and accommodation are one supply. The guidelines were withdrawn, and food and accommodation must now be treated separately. I understand that the separate treatment must occur from 1 January 2001. I would strongly recommend that the government extend that deadline until 1 July 2001 and that they consult further with the sector. Since the amount of revenue involved is low, I see no reason why the ATO should not make that recommendation to the government and that the government should not respond to that recommendation. </para><para>As I mentioned, the issue is not directly dealt with by this bill. Partially for that reason, and partially because of the fact that I am confident we would not have the agreement of either the government or Labor to change the treatment of those supplies, we will not be pursuing an amendment at this time. However, Minister, it is within your ability to extend the concession until 1 July and consult further. Our spokesperson on schools, Senator Allison, is currently reviewing a number of issues relating to schools in this area, several of which have arisen out of ATO rulings. The taxation of food provided in boarding schools will be considered by her in that context.</para><para>In terms of the remainder of the bill, the Democrats are supportive. I have always dismissed the idea that major tax legislation should not be amended and that it is a mess because it is amended. Every Labor tax initiative I have ever seen was amended, and it is just nonsense to pretend otherwise. I know why you make the argument. You enjoy making it, and I suppose we enjoy refuting it. I am glad that the government do amend legislation if it is found to be weak or poor in any effect. We are rapidly running out of time to deal with legislation this year, so this bill is urgent. Before I sit down I should deal with Senator Cook's second reading amendment as moved by Senator Sherry. This really is not a serious amendment. It has been brought on three times. It has been rejected twice. The first line of the amendment reads: </para><quote><para>... but the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households—</para></quote><para>I return to the remarks I made the first time it was dealt with. I would like to know what taxation regime anywhere in the world does not have a serious impact on the households in the country. It would be a strange taxation system which had a minimal or a negative impact. Every taxation system has a serious impact, so this vague statement is meaningless. Does Senator Cook refer to price increases as a result of the imposition of the goods and services tax? If he does, he should say so. Or is it a reference to GST generally or just on petrol; or is it a reference to the income tax regime; or to bracket creep, which was instituted by his government; or is it a reference to the fact that taxation takes a slice of everybody's pay packet? The taxation regime covers every aspect of taxation in our tax regime, so that line of the amendment should have been corrected. However, we have still got it. What part of the total tax system, much of which the Labor government had a hand in, does Senator Cook refer to? That first line of the amendment is simply too vague and too meaningless for us to understand. The second part of the suggested second reading amendment does deserve serious attention. It reads:</para><quote><para>... and calls on the Government to remove that effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001. </para></quote><para>The indexation affects not just petrol but all fuels. It also affects cigarettes, beer and spirits. We have indexation, courtesy of the Labor Party. It is a continuing policy supported by the government, so it is a bipartisan policy. There is no suggestion from Senator Cook or the Labor Party that indexation should not be continued. He is suggesting that one part—the fuel excise indexation adjustment—should be dealt with: only that portion of it occasioned by the GST spike and not by other forms of inflation. If you are going to make that recommendation, you should tell us what the costs would be. The other day I told you what the cost would be. The overall cost, as regards fuels, would be approximately $350 million, which is about 0.8 cents a litre. However, if it is applied to the entire GST indexation spike on excise, you end up with a cost of $600 million, of which about $50 million would be for beer, about $30 million for spirits and about $170 million for tobacco.</para><para>I tell the Labor Party: I think it is a legitimate policy proposal that the GST indexation spike on excise could be considered for removal, but it has to be considered across all excise and it can be considered only when the government tell us whether there is going to be enough revenue to do it. Until such time as we know what the consequences of the GST returns are, we are not going to know whether the surplus exceeds government estimates by such that they could afford it. It is only when we know we can afford it that we can consider the serious policy, and then when we consider the serious policy it is up to the government to recommend it. However, I acknowledge it is a serious policy proposal and it would kill two promises with one hit. It would go some way to meeting the government's promise on fuel, which we and others believe they underperformed on to the people of Australia. I recognise that it is not going to do that much for fuel. If you asked the motorists whether they would accept any cut, they would take a small cut.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Particularly at this time of year.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Particularly at this time of the year.

We all recognise that, if you adopt that policy, it will be giving a free kick to spirits and tobacco. We have to work out whether that is justifiable. As I said the other day, my own belief is that the pricing of cigarettes has reached the stage where any further price increase, in revenue generation terms, would be negative because the price effects are affecting consumption in the way they are.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The net summary of my evaluation of the opposition's second reading amendment is that the first line is vague and nonsensical; the second two lines are of interest but they do not refer to the entire GST indexation spike effect on the range of all excises, not just petrol; and, of course, they do not refer to how it should be funded. If you have excess GST revenue and the government show that—which of course they have not because they put out their reports so early that we do not know that, although the Democrats think they will have enough money—it might be a rather nice present to give people in the new year. I offer the view that the Democrats would consider that seriously. My party room has not come to a view on that but, certainly, we would be interested if the Labor Party and the government were interested. With those remarks, I look forward to the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>21144</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendment that I will be moving in the committee stage is to remove the current threat to the Regional Forest Agreement Private Forest Reserve Program in Tasmania, where $60 million from the regional forest agreement and the Natural Heritage Trust Fund has been set aside, including $10 million from the Tasmanian government, to pay landowners to protect land of high conservation value rather than to have it woodchipped. Landowners moving to do that, who are of course acting in the community interest—because these woodlands or forests have rare and endangered species or ecosystems—have discovered that, on the one hand, they are being given money to protect those woodlands or forests for the next 20 years and, on the other hand, they face a capital gains tax. Close to half of the money will be taken back by the federal government, which established the scheme and which is the primary funder. That was never made public at the time the scheme was put forward as part of the RFA package. The Prime Minister never made it clear that this was subject to capital gains tax when he announced the program in Perth, in Tasmania, in 1998. I know this scheme has the real potential to fail in its intention to protect woodlands and forests of high conservation value on private land in Tasmania. </para></talk.start><para>The amendment I have simply says that `this program will not be subject to capital gains tax' and that it ought to be passed to remove doubt over this scheme, which is being implemented but is way behind schedule at the moment. It also should be passed to remove doubt from those landowners who are considering whether or not to log their block instead of keeping it. The longer that this is delayed, the more the damage that will occur. It is, therefore, not just an amendment but it is quite an urgent amendment, which I hope the Senate will support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>21145</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will say a few brief words to sum up, but there will be an extensive debate on most of the matters that have been raised in the second reading debate.

The current law allows the GST registered provider of a fringe benefit to claim input tax credits on acquisitions related to providing that fringe benefit. However, if the cost of providing the fringe benefit is not fully deductible under income tax law the amount of input tax credits available is reduced accordingly. Therefore, as an example, if in the provision of a fringe benefit only 60 per cent is deductible for income tax purposes, the provider of the fringe benefit will be entitled to only 60 per cent of the input tax credits that would otherwise have been available. The bill contains a measure that will ensure that this reduction in input tax credits also applies to the provision of all meal, entertainment and entertainment facility fringe benefits. While this provision is intended to apply to all entities, some tax practitioners have questioned whether the amendment will apply to an entity that is exempt from income tax. To put this beyond doubt, the government is amending the bill to make it clear that the reduction in input tax credits applies to the provision of all meal, entertainment and entertainment facility fringe benefits regardless of whether the provider is exempt from income tax.</para><para>The next amendment corrects a drafting error in the bill. The bill contains a concessional measure that gives the Commissioner of Taxation the discretion to refund a net business activity statement credit rather than apply it to a tax credit—that is, where the debt is due but not yet payable, taxpayers comply with an arrangement to pay the debt by instalments or the commissioner has agreed to defer recovery of the debt. Due to a drafting oversight, the bill does not contain an application provision that backdates the amendment to 1 July 2000. Therefore, the government is amending the bill to ensure that the measure giving the commissioner the discretion to refund a BAS amount rather than apply it to a tax debt applies from 1 July 2000.</para><para>The bill contains provisions that will prevent insurers from rearranging the payment of excesses so that they can claim input tax credits for payments they have not made. These provisions provide for an increasing adjustment in such circumstances. An increasing adjustment increases the net amount owing to the Australian Taxation Office and therefore claws back the tax benefit the insurer obtained. In further consultation with the insurance industry, it has expressed concerns about being able to calculate the increasing adjustment under the new provisions. Therefore, the government is amending the bill to provide a different way in which to determine the amount of the increasing adjustment. The method was proposed by the insurance industry as being a workable alternative that will still achieve the intended policy result. The industry also pointed out that it is reasonably common for insurers to refund insurance excesses in certain circumstances. If an insurer has had an increasing adjustment on an excess which is then refunded, the increasing adjustment should be reversed. The government is therefore amending the bill to provide for a decreasing adjustment in such circumstances. A decreasing adjustment decreases the net amount of GST owing to the tax office. Full details of the amendments to the bill are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

Australians are renowned not only for Olympic prowess but also for their love of swimming and the beach. Every summer Australians flock to the beach or the pool with families and friends. Regrettably, it is during those summer holidays that the majority of drownings occur.</para><para>Although the rate of drowning has decreased in recent years, it is still a major cause of accidental death in Australia, and there have been a number of initiatives to try to reduce it. In the 12 months to 30 June this year, 296 Australians lost their lives through drowning. There is no doubt that some of these people could have been saved if they and those around them had had better water safety skills and lifesaving skills. That is why the Democrats have such a strong commitment to water safety education and training. In particular, the Democrats believe that water safety skills should be targeted at those most at risk of drowning. Those risk groups include young children and young adults between 16 and 34 years of age. To reduce the rate of drowning, a comprehensive education program is needed that will teach children from a very young age the basics of water safety and will continue to reinforce the basics and will teach advanced skills such as resuscitation through to adulthood.</para><para>It is only through a sustained approach to education and training across all age groups that a reduction in water sport accidents and drowning deaths will occur. This is why the Democrats argued so strongly for water safety programs to be exempted from the GST during our negotiations with the government on the new tax system. As part of that negotiation process, the Democrats obtained agreement from the government to exempt lifesaving and first-aid courses from the GST. At the time of the negotiations, we understood that the exemption would cover the broad spectrum of water safety and lifesaving skills training provided by organisations such as the Royal Life Saving Society. Lifesaving and water safety education encompass a broad range of skills. These include basic water safety education, which should be provided at a young age, before specific lifesaving skills can be taught. The Royal Life Saving Society has developed and coordinated a seven-step program which introduces lifesaving and water safety knowledge in a staged program. </para><para>This comprehensive curriculum provides an appropriate and effective lifesaving and water safety program that can provide all Australians with the skills they need to keep themselves and others safe around water. The early stages of this program are designed to be taught to younger children when they are learning basic swimming skills. For young children, the focus is on water safety rather than on lifesaving and first aid training, which hopefully they will move on to. However, these water safety and personal survival skills courses form an essential, indeed compulsory, part of lifesaving training. No-one should attempt to rescue another person from the water unless they themselves are competent swimmers. Therefore, it was the intention of the Democrats at the time of the negotiations that all water safety courses would be exempted from the GST. However, the Australian Taxation Office has interpreted the wording of the exemption very narrowly and restricted it to those courses that have an explicit lifesaving or first-aid component. The Democrats did not intend the exemption to be interpreted this narrowly, and at the time of the tax reform negotiations were working on the basis of advice that the amendment would cover the spectrum of water safety and aquatic personal survival courses. It makes no sense to impose a GST on courses that teach young children how to keep themselves safe around water while exempting more advanced courses that build on and extend those essential skills. The Democrats would certainly not have agreed to the wording of the exemption if we had been advised at the time that this was how the ATO would interpret it. Therefore, to clarify our original intention we have moved this amendment, which makes clear that all courses teaching aquatic personal survival skills are exempt from the GST. I hope that all of the Senate will support this amendment in the interests of making our beaches, pools and waterways safer places for Australians to enjoy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>21151</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To clarify, is the government supporting this amendment from the Australian Democrats?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>21151</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps it might help if I made my own comments clearer. The government will not be supporting the Democrats' proposed amendment to the bill. The law makes first aid and lifesaving courses GST free. These courses are those principally involving first aid, resuscitation or other similar lifesaving skills, surf lifesaving and aeromedical rescue. The Democrats have proposed that GST-free treatment should be extended from courses that principally involve lifesaving to courses that involve personal aquatic survival skills. These skills are integrated into a multistage course that might include a future lifesaving component. The government acknowledges that, in order to save a life in the water, it is essential that a lifesaver have swimming skills. However, it does not logically follow that all water safety instruction leading up to lifesaver level training should, therefore, be GST free. In this regard, a course of study principally involving aeromedical rescue is GST free. But it does not follow that all pilot training that might lead up to future aeromedical rescue training should also be GST free. </para></talk.start><para>I must differ from my colleague Senator Murray on this issue. To extend the coverage of courses in this way would go beyond the spirit of what we believe was the government's agreement with the Democrats to make lifesaving and first aid courses GST free. In addition, the proposal would create an uncertain boundary line between standard swimming lessons and those designed specifically to provide individuals with lifesaving skills. We will not be supporting this amendment. It creates an uncertain boundary line. For example, the great tragedy that we have over Christmas is the number of deaths on our roads. Does it follow from that that driving courses should be GST free? I think Senator Murray would say no. The design of the tax package was to have as broad a base as possible but provide very extensive compensation in the way of large tax cuts and real rises in pensions and benefits and allowances. This creates an uncertain boundary line and will certainly lead to further pressures from other groups to extend that.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>21152</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am somewhat concerned that, on the one hand, we had a story from Senator Murray that the Democrats were advised by the government—whoever that was—that this area in which they are seeking a roll-back to the GST was covered in the agreement and, on the other hand, we are advised by Senator Kemp that the amendment moved goes beyond the spirit of the government's agreement with the Democrats.

It is outrageous that the Democrats let this through when you carried your deal with them in respect of the GST. It is absolutely outrageous.

Here we are coming up to this important part of the holiday period when our young people, in particular, are participating in swimming, and the government is seeking to knee-cap the aquatic personal survival courses.

It is just astounding.</para><para>It is not as though you are not aware of this, Senator Kemp, because the letter from the Royal Lifesaving Society of Australia goes on to say that the Prime Minister's chief of staff is aware of this issue, as is the Treasurer's tax adviser.

The Labor Party are going to support this amendment. We are not going to have a GST applying to aquatic personal survival. I cannot think of a better example of the roll-back momentum we want to develop in respect of the GST than removing the GST from aquatic personal survival.

That is the way we read it. As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, this bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation in certain circumstances to cancel an entity's GST registration where it has applied to the commissioner for cancellation before it has been registered for 12 months. We all welcome that. In its current form, the provision will operate prospectively. This amendment by the Labor Party will give the commission the discretion—I repeat: discretion—to retrospectively deregister an entity. </para></talk.start><para>We can see problems with retrospective deregistration, particularly for businesses that have charged GST and collected input tax credits since 1 July 2000. But the commissioner would never agree to that. So where a business has operated in that way we do not expect that retrospective deregistration would be granted. We have to give the commissioner some credit for having a few brains. We can envisage that there could be a small number of instances in which it would be appropriate to regard an entity as not having been in the GST system from 1 July 2000, even though they may have been registered. We accept the wisdom and the ability of the commissioner and his staff to determine appropriate circumstances in which to grant retrospective deregistration and when to decline it. As Democrats, we do believe in giving regulators discretion to independently assess particular circumstances. This is one of those instances where flexibility is desirable. It does not alter the government's intention; it just makes sure the commissioner has the discretion.

Item 18 of schedule 6 of this bill will apply an associates test to the not-for-profit subentity provisions of the GST act. That will mean that many quite minor transactions involving schools, churches, sporting clubs and not-for-profit entities generally will now need to be recorded and accounted for through BAS reporting. The sorts of transactions to which I am referring are things like providing the use of a meeting room to a school's sports club. As I have mentioned, we can see what the government is trying to do. We have therefore set a threshold so that in the minor area people simply do not need to comply. This amendment will allow a parent entity to make gifts of up to $5,000 per year to each of its subentities—remember, we are talking about the not-for-profit sector—without those gifts needing to be recorded. We think it would alleviate a substantial amount of the burden, particularly on the smaller not-for-profit entities, while at the same time protecting the revenue. We do not think the amendment amounts to any significant revenue loss to the government, nor will it result in a distortion of the playing field on the rare occasion when not-for-profit sector subentities are competing with for-profit providers.

The advice I have received is that the amendment, in the way it is drafted, does not achieve the objective that it sets out to achieve. The amendment, regrettably, has been poorly drafted: whereas we understand your aim, the amendment does not achieve that. That is the advice that I have received from the many experts that we have advising the government on this matter. Let me make a couple of observations. The nonprofit subentities provisions were introduced to allow certain nonprofit organisations the choice of treating some of their activities as effectively input taxed. This has been achieved by allowing certain nonprofit organisations the choice of treating separately identifiable units in their organisation as though they were separate entities for GST purposes. As a result of being treated as an entity, a nonprofit subentity is not required to register for GST where its annual turnover is below the registration turnover threshold. The `associate' provision of the GST act is to ensure that supplies from entities' associates for nil or an inadequate consideration are properly valued for GST purposes. However, the term `associate' for GST purposes does not take into account the existence of nonprofit subentities. This means that certain transactions to or from nonprofit subentities for nil or inadequate consideration escape GST consequences. There are a number of other technical matters I could raise. The government has looked closely at this, as we always do with anything Senator Murray puts up, but we will not be supporting it. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21155</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I could not let that escape without making a remark.

I do not think you are a scoundrel, but what I mean by that is: you do know that the Democrats did say to the government that we would like you to examine our draft amendment and take a technical view on it and advise us accordingly. The Treasury through the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer declined to do so. Frankly, it is therefore not appropriate for you to say that the amendment was designed badly if you won't even participate in the designing, even if you might disagree with the policy intent.

We would have been happy to supply our adviser to you in respect of the GST, because it would have been a very simple instruction: no GST. We cannot support it because I am advised by my adviser that, with the flaws in it, it would cause some considerable confusion and damage. It may be something that can be considered by us next year when we are confronted with the inevitable further GST roll-back amendments.

This is an issue that Senator Brown and I have had some discussions on in the past; in fact, I think Senator Brown asked me a question on this matter. There are two issues and I just wish to say that I think, just looking at the actual drafting of the amendments, there are some technical problems with the amendments you have moved. Regrettably, they do not achieve entirely the objective that you have set out. In fact, I think that on one interpretation they can provide for a double payment effect. But that is not a substantive matter.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown, you would be aware that the Premier of Tasmania has written to the Prime Minister requesting that the capital gains tax consequences of covenants issued under the Regional Forest Agreements Private Forest Reserve Program in Tasmania be amended. The existing capital gains tax treatment is claimed to be limiting the effectiveness of the private forest reserve program. Let me just say this to you, Senator Brown, and I think that this will be of interest to you: the government is carefully considering the issue of the CGT consequences for land owners of adopting covenants under the regional forest agreement and the private forest reserve program. The issue is the subject of consultation between relevant Commonwealth agencies and therefore it would be, in our view, premature at this point to proceed with any proposals. I think I can pre-empt the question you are going to ask me—`How quickly, Senator Kemp, can this be finalised?'—by saying that there are a number of parties to it and, of course, there are consultations but naturally it would be the Commonwealth's view that we would seek to finalise these matters as soon as possible.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>21156</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I should indicate to the chamber that, while I am certainly interested in the intent of Senator Brown's amendments, I am aware of the potential and particular problems, without necessarily accepting the extent of some of the claims and claimed difficulties.

If the situation continues under the current tax office ruling, it means that a $60 million program to protect the environment in Tasmania is going to have $20 million or $25 million siphoned off by the tax office. This is not a capital gain as far as landowners are concerned; for many of them it is a concession to the public interest. They know what the price for woodchips is. They would just as well get the 100 per cent tax write-off by flattening the trees in their back paddock or on their hilltop and having them taken off to the woodchip mill. But there are very important environmental matters involved. Part of the regional forest agreements the Prime Minister signed and has advocated since 1998 was that there was a balance there, and this is the important balance as far as private land-holdings are concerned. I can tell the government and the Labor Party that this scheme is going to be effectively undermined by the capital gains tax. I have had one landowner say to me that he wants to proceed because he wants to protect the block, but he is not going to pay the tax and will take it to the High Court if necessary, although he recognises that that will break him. </para><para>It is a terrible situation to have arisen. It should have been fixed. I might say to Senator Sherry that this is the place to fix it. This is a tax amendment bill. The Labor Party should be fixing it right here and now. As the Labor Party knows, all sorts of bills are amended to bring up a particular matter which does not warrant a specific piece of legislation, because of the urgency of the matter. I am extraordinarily disappointed with the Labor Party, and particularly with the Tasmanian Labor senators, who should have taken this matter up seriously and seen that tonight we were getting action and were not left to an unspecified timetable of talks between government officials and letters between MPs. On the ground, this whole scheme is failing for want of assurance on this matter. I thank Senator Harradine for having studied it. </para><para>I finally want to say that the minister's submission that this amendment is not satisfactory is not correct. The amendment is satisfactory. It does the job and, if there are technicalities which mean that it is short of the mark, let him say what they are. He will not, because the amendment is satisfactory. It is just a way of saying, `We don't want to deal with this at the moment. We want to go on to something else.' I have said my bit, and I will be continuing to raise this matter back home in Tasmania until justice is done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>21157</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the record, this amendment will provide that any consideration received by a person in exchange for placing a restrictive covenant on the person's land under the regional forest agreements Private Forest Reserve Program will not be regarded as capital proceeds.

In fact, the opposition has today tabled a private member's bill in the other house which would implement in legislative form Labor's policies in regard to future policy directions that might be followed in terms of trying to redress some of the most serious flaws in this legislation. The opposition was successful, with the Democrats, in having the Senate pass some 23 amendments to this bill, which covered issues such as the objects of the bill, the question of the enrolment benchmark adjustment, the strengthening of educational accountability, measures in regard to the Commonwealth assistance for capital projects, various listings for non-government schools and eligibility guidelines for assistance, and various other accountability measures in regard to information about grants, financial questionnaires and the like. These measures together would have made this bill a lot fairer than it currently is.</para></talk.start><para>The enrolment benchmark adjustment was clearly the most serious issue, and the government here has remained intransigent. The EBA is a policy which all sectors of the education community are arguing ought to be abolished. The minister is quite alone on this question. The effect of this policy has seen the removal of moneys from the public education system. It has seen the operation of Dr Kemp's ideology, if you like, in terms of his discriminatory attitude towards public education in this country. What the minister has done is to effectively make a rod for his own back. I think that in due course this will come to be seen by even the government itself.</para><para>I have explained in detail to the Senate my concerns about the unfairness, the injustice and the divisiveness of this bill, so I will not go to those issues in any length, but I do believe that this government will be obliged to change its position, just as it was obliged to change its position on the issue of Greenwich University. It did, Minister, on the question of Greenwich University because when I raised the issue of Greenwich University you, Senator Tierney and Senator Abetz said that the concerns that I had were not justified—all of you. You, Minister, made it perfectly clear that the government's view in regard to that outfit out there at Norfolk Island, this interloper, was justified. I ask you, Minister: can you now confirm for me that the Gallagher committee of inquiry report into this dubious entity has discovered that this government effectively has now dumped Greenwich University, that the opposition's concerns in that regard have been completely vindicated and that the government has effectively given a thumbs down to this university? I am sure, just as it has done in the case of the university out at Norfolk Island, it will in due course have to understand that, in terms of the states grants policy, its attitude is completely wrong. As I understand it, the minister is likely to announce very shortly that the committee of inquiry has found that, in terms of the standards and the quality, for reasons relating to the failure to meet the normal standards for an Australian university, the government will not be allowing the Australian qualifications framework to recognise Greenwich University. I believe that the same sorts of questions will arise about the government's schools policy and you will see that the government will be obliged to reassess its attitude.</para><para>As I understand it, the report on the state-Commonwealth committee into Greenwich has in fact vindicated all the concerns that I raised initially in the parliament and through the Senate estimates committee. These, as I said, were dismissed by the government as trifling and misguided. In fact, Minister, it was the actions of the government that saw this matter raised through the Senate Privileges Committee. I was asked to retract my statements in respect of questions about the quality of teaching, scholarship and research at Greenwich. It is now clear why I did not retract those statements and why I firmly believe that the government's attitude in terms of quality in education has been so badly misguided. This government, in the schools area, will I am sure equally have to face up to the responsibility it has for the damage done through its cavalier and callous attitude towards the education of our young. </para><para>The other issue I would like to briefly touch upon is the question of the Blue Gum School, which I raised on previous occasions. It was said by officers to you, Minister, at the previous hearing that the reason Blue Gum had not been allowed to receive Commonwealth assistance was that they had not applied. There were previous discussions here that they had not applied.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name></talker><para>—No, they were not registered; I did not say they had not applied.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—That was the first question. At the Senate estimates you said that they had not applied and in here you said they had not applied. Then you said that they were not registered. What we have been able to discover since then is that there is a somewhat inconsistent attitude on this issue in terms of the statements made by the minister's office and by DETYA officers to Blue Gum regarding applications for federal government assistance. The registry of guidelines indicated, according to the correspondence I have from the school concerned, that state registration was not an issue that became apparent to them until it was raised here. For instance, when I asked the question on 30 November concerning the school, Minister, you stated that the Commonwealth assistance was contingent on a school being recognised and registered by a state and territory. I believe the statement you made was: `Blue Gum cannot meet the provisions for that Commonwealth assistance.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>This statement, according to Blue Gum, is false. In accordance with the requirements of ACT school registration, Blue Gum School notified the Australian Capital Territory education minister in 1999 that it intended to open as a registered school in 2001, after operating highly successful preschool and kindergarten classes throughout 1998. The Blue Gum School lodged comprehensive documentation detailing its philosophy, educational program and so on with the education department, as required, in early August 2000. As was the usual practice, the ACT education department planned to finalise their school registration just prior to the official school opening next year. As I understand it, the statements that have been made resulted from conflicting advice which had actually emanated from DETYA or Dr Kemp's office to this particular school. The statement I have from the school says that they received different advice from different sections of the government on this matter. On the one hand they were told that they must get registration and on the other hand that they did not require registration. I am concerned about that matter, Minister. I am concerned that the department may not have got all the information in relation to this particular school. </para><para>I received a statement today from this school which says that the human rights office is investigating a religious discrimination claim by the Blue Gum School arising from the federal government's new SES schools funding model. It says that, under the new SES funding model, new Catholic schools in the Australian Capital Territory will receive $2,964 per student while comparable non-Catholic schools, such as Blue Gum, will attract only $1,947 per student—$1,000 less. It is claiming that it is blatant discrimination. It says that it is not fair, that it is not equitable, that it is not simple and that it is not transparent. It is arguing that this is a cynical exercise in vote buying. It is quite an interesting statement, Minister; I trust you have seen it or that your attention has been drawn to it. As I said, this school is taking its concerns up with the human rights office.</para><para>The fundamental position on these issues is that the government is seeking to blackmail 3.2 million Australian children. It is insisting upon this legislation going though without amendment irrespective of the demonstrable case, the overwhelming case, that has been made for why it is so unfair and so unjust. This government is holding 10,000 schools to ransom and, in doing so, it is bringing no credit to itself whatsoever. The Labor Party in government will address this. We will campaign on this issue in the run-up to the election, and we have made perfectly clear, by way of a private member's bill, the nature of our commitments, if those who are interested in this issue have not already understood the concerns that we have raised about this bill and the reason why we think it is so unfair, so unjust and so divisive. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>21160</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe we should insist on the amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.M.

In relation to the others, No. 2 goes to the definition of `ecological sustainability'. We are in a bit of a bind right now, because we have asked the Senate staff to prepare an amendment to replace the existing one with the definition of `ecological sustainability' which appears in the EPBC legislation. It is a bit more comprehensive, and I understand that the government may be in a position to accept that. I flag that as one that needs to be treated separately. No. 24 goes to the opposition amendment which was passed after amendment by the Australian Greens. It goes to the review of the operation of the act. We will be moving that amendment in amended form. There are, essentially, one or two words that need to be added. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The House of Representatives has already made an amendment to No. 24.

So I thought it would be opportune to at least give other parties an idea of where we are going whilst this is proceeding. So No. 24 will be circulated but strengthened to include a review of the adequacy of the penalties, together with a review as to whether CPI indexation should be adopted. The review is to make an assessment of CPI indexation, and we will come to the words when it comes to us. The other amendment which is also a live one is amendment No. 7. That is the amendment which, at this stage, lists the eligible renewable energy sources. I understand the government may be seeking to amend that to include—as well as everything else that is there—hot rocks, wave and ocean, co-firing and fuel cell.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendment that we do have a problem with is amendment No. 22. That amendment embraces the concept of indexation in this legislation. Indexation has always been our major concern. We have had a concern that the charges set may not be adequate enough to drive the renewable energy that the government claims it would. We have been pursuing indexation. We have been advised that, because of constitutional problems, the indexation provision is best suited in the charge bill, which is the supplementary piece of legislation currently before us, and that this amendment should not be moved to this particular legislation. So we will be considering that in respect of the charge bill.</para><para>The other major concern that we have had is the degree to which this legislation would force reliance on native forests. Our approach in that respect has been to move amendments to ensure disclosure of quite a number of things—for example, the eligible renewable power sources from which the power is intended to be generated, which is an Australian Greens amendment which we support; and the estimated average annual output of each source listed under the previous subparagraph of that amendment. We have also adopted the Greens amendment that the regulator must enter details of the application on the register of applicants for accredited power stations. Another provision is to ensure that there must be publication on the Internet within 30 days after the regulator registers a certificate. Basically, there is a whole regime to ensure disclosure of the renewable energy source and the level of dependence on such source. We felt that that level of transparency is extremely important in ensuring, before the event, that this legislation is not abused to access more than the available waste from forests. I have to say at this stage of the debate that that is still a continuing concern on our part.</para><para>We are also concerned that, in many ways, this legislation has become the victim of an industry power play. We share the aspirations, I think of everyone in this place, to generate a renewable energy industry, and we saw this legislation as a vehicle to achieve that. Our concerns as to whether it will do that have been ever increasing. One of the reasons they have been ever increasing is that we find that, over the last couple of  months, different energies have locked in behind a different aspect or another of the legislation to the extent that they may have led to a total ossification of the political process. We are keen to achieve some sort of circuit-breaker to that and to do so in a way that does protect against some of the concerns we have.</para><para>I have taken this opportunity to explain the course that we will be pursuing in this part of the debate, in part to ensure senators are aware of what we are doing but also to give the Senate staff some time to prepare the actual final words to the amendments. But, as I indicated, the changes to those amendments are major only with respect to amendment No. 24. It is a major addition in terms of scrutiny and review. We are moving the other amendments in an amended form. With respect to amendment No. 2, `ecological sustainabilities', we believe we are strengthening that amendment by picking up the EPBC amendment. With respect to amendment No. 7, we look forward to the government's amendments to that.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, before you proceed, I was thinking that, if the chamber was agreeable, we could put the amendments individually, starting at No. 1 and working through, so that we could actually get some out of the way, and then put the amendments that are to be amended.

We are being asked to consider amendments we have not yet seen to a piece of legislation which is very important to us. We were ready to debate the <inline ref="R1069">Gene Technology Bill 2000</inline> at 7.30 p.m. The agreement was that that was going to be given the rest of the evening. Suddenly we are now confronted with not only a new arrangement between the government and the Labor Party as to how they carve up the amendments which the government has not agreed to in the House of Representatives but also some entirely new amendments which we have not yet seen. I think under those circumstances we should report progress and come back to this when the amendments have appeared. I think that will save a lot of time. It is testing our forbearance—it is testing mine, I can tell you—to be dealing with this at all. I think instead of it being a shambles, which it is at the moment, we should have everything in front of us. As far as I am concerned—and I am sure as far as my Democrat colleague is concerned—we are happy to deal with the gene technology bill as well as this bill because they are both in the environmental bailiwick. The other parties are asking us to give proper consideration to new amendments while we are having to deal with the amendments in front of the committee. That is not feasible and it is not fair. The best I can make of this is that we report progress and come back to this after the gene technology bill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Are you moving that way, Senator Brown?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—I will move that way and see if the government and the opposition will agree to that.

Again, there are a large number of people who believed that at 7.30 p.m. we would come back to the gene technology bill. I have a feeling that we will be unjustifiably accused of speaking to exhaustion on that bill when there was no such intent on my part or, I believe, on the part of other persons intimately involved in the discussions on that legislation. The sooner we get to the gene technology bill the better. There are a lot of technical matters, and we need to be pretty wide awake.

The definition of `cloning' does not include the somatic cell nuclear transfer process, which is the Dolly process. An embryo formed by that process will not be completely genetically identical. The egg used is enucleated—by the way, I like to use the word `denucleated' rather than enucleated, but enucleated is apparently the more correct word—but still contains the extra nucleate material, including the mitochondria. The mitochondria contains up to one per cent of the DNA and RNA, hence an individual formed by somatic cell nuclear transfer will not be 100 per cent genetically identical. Furthermore, a scientist wanting to avoid such a prohibition could introduce a minor genetic change. Those matters, I thought, would have been or should have been obvious to the NHMRC and to the department of health. Clearly the government was misadvised in that respect.</para><para>I also indicate in passing that last night quite incorrect comments were made by the parliamentary secretary about my amendments which would prevent work being done in respect of either somatic cell nuclear transfers—and the cloning of a human being through that—or the obtaining of stem cells from an embryo. There was some suggestion by the parliamentary secretary that there was a great need for organs and other material for an ill person. The situation is that the earliest that organs can be obtained is when the human being reaches the foetal stage. That is the earliest they can be obtained; they can be obtained then right throughout life. In effect, the advice that was given to the parliamentary secretary—and I know it was not the parliamentary secretary's intention and it certainly wasn't the government's intention—was such that it almost approved of the abortion of the foetus and the transfer of organs from the foetus. That raises enormous ethical problems. But that is an aside. </para><para>Another point that I should raise concerns the advice that has been given in respect of what the states will do.

What concerns me about that is the type of advice that may be being given to the states by the officials of the NHMRC and others.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In a letter that I sent to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon.

It also prompts a question about the origin of the phrase "whole human being" in the Government's amendment to the Gene Technology Bill 2000 and the fact that the position that appears to have been adopted by the Health Ministers was based on misrepresentation of the position adopted by AHEC. If the Ministers meant to adopt AHEC's advice, then I submit that they have been badly misled as to the nature of that advice.</para><para>Yours sincerely,</para><para>Senator Brian Harradine</para></quote><para>The purpose of my amendment now is to give effect to the government amendment adopted last night. Unless there is a proper definition of cloning which will cover the cloning techniques that I referred to, then the whole thing is inoperative. I believe it is clumsy anyhow, because it relies on criminal sanctions for enforcement and I do not think that is the most effective way to go about preventing cloning of human beings in Australia. Nobody wants to see the state police charging through laboratories and getting evidence and all the rest of it. Whereas, if you had a licensing procedure—as in the amendment I put forward that was unfortunately defeated—you would simply look up the file when a scientist publishes the results of his work and ask, `Did he have a licence to do this or didn't he?' If he did not, then he or she or the institution would be liable. That is an aside. </para><para>I ask the parliamentary secretary—I know we had trouble getting answers the last time we met—whether the government believe that their definition of cloning is effective? Do the government believe that it is scientifically accurate that, if the identicality cornerstone is built upon, it might crumble and the whole structure fall to the ground? If the government feel that it is effective, I am not going to proceed with it. It is on their head. That is the trouble with this debate. I am afraid certain things will happen in this area in the next few years of which we will all be ashamed. If the government say that their definition, which includes the identicality cornerstone, is satisfactory technically and scientifically, I will leave it to them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21166</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate that this is an important issue, and I thank Senator Harradine for getting in before me with regard to getting the running sheet first because it forces us to deal with what is obviously a pressing and very important issue. If we can deal with the issues that have been raised, then I feel it will free the debate to a certain extent to enable us to make good progress throughout the rest of the evening. But I do appreciate the seriousness of the issues that Senator Harradine has been pursuing with me last week in the second reading debate and in the various committee stages, which at times have taxed us both, I am sure. As I said to him over dinner tonight, at times he posed a certain question to me about the definition of `whole human being'. I recounted the story to him that I have had a heart valve replaced and I have been circumcised, so does that make me less than a whole human being or perhaps genetically modified? I think I am no less a human being, Senator Harradine, for my operations that I have had to face. However, let me get serious with regard to the legislation and address the issues that Senator Harradine has raised relating to the necessity for comprehensive and proper legislation in this regard. </para></talk.start><para>The measures in the <inline ref="R1069">Gene Technology Bill 2000</inline> are interim until each state and territory has implemented appropriate legislation. As has been referred to in this debate, some states—South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia—have already enacted state specific legislation with the object of prohibiting human cloning, while others are in the process of developing legislation. It is important that the work done to date by those jurisdictions is built on to ensure that Australia has a national, comprehensive and effective prohibition on human cloning. I also appreciate the points that Senator Harradine has made with regard to the need for urgency in that area.  </para><para>The Commonwealth, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, will work with states and territories to develop a nationally consistent scheme which will comprehensively address human cloning. The NHMRC has already initiated a process of consultation with state and territory jurisdictions, and the development of the national system, which will ensure comprehensive coverage in this important area, will be undertaken carefully and inclusively. The government is aware that there is a great deal of public interest in the issue of human cloning. The inquiry currently being undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, referred to as the Andrews committee, has undertaken a wide public consultation process seeking views on human cloning, including therapeutic cloning. Both the Andrews committee and the NHMRC are expected to report on their findings in March 2001. With the comprehensive stakeholder consultation of the Andrews committee, coupled with the NHMRC's consultation with states and territories, the Commonwealth will then be in a strong and informed position to determine the need for further regulation in this area. Senator Harradine's comments are certainly very helpful in that regard, particularly with regard to the matter of priorities.</para><para>Senator Harradine is of the view that the office of the NHMRC has misrepresented the views of the Australian Health Ethics Committee on the subject of cloning of human beings. In particular, Senator Harradine believes that the Australian Health Ethics Committee did not identify a distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning, whereas the NHMRC has relied on such a distinction in briefing state and territory health ministers on cloning issues. I am advised that this is not the case. The report that both Senator Harradine and the office of the NHMRC were quoting was a December 1998 report from the Australian Health Ethics Committee to the Minister for Health and Aged Care entitled <inline font-style="italic">Scientific, ethical and regulatory considerations relevant to cloning of human beings</inline>. In this report, the Australian Health Ethics Committee did make a distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. In fact, this was written into the terms of reference provided to AHEC by the minister. Reference No. 1 reads: </para><quote><para>distinguish between the cloning of human beings and human tissue and identify the considerations for each technique;</para></quote><para>In its report, AHEC outlined and discussed considerations relevant to both the cloning of human beings and what is commonly referred to as therapeutic cloning. At the end of `Chapter 3—ethical issues' on page 31, the report states:</para><quote><para>A distinction has been drawn between the cloning of human `wholes' and the cloning of the component `parts' of a human being.</para></quote><para>The Office of the NHMRC has not misled, either intentionally or unintentionally, state and territory health ministers or state and territory departments of health on this matter. The guidelines were never intended to have a broader application than in the regulation of ART, for example, through the inclusion in the Gene Technology Bill. In terms of Senator Harradine's query about definitions, the government believes that its language is consistent with World Health Organisation resolutions on this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>21167</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Harradine on this and I have not clearly heard from the government any reason as to why his amendment should not be adopted.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>21167</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak to Senator Harradine's new amendment. I notice that he has changed the positioning of the definition. Senator Harradine's definition was originally intended for the front of the bill. The government put up an argument last time that it is more appropriate in the back of the bill in the miscellaneous section, so Senator Harradine has accommodated the government in that sense with his amendment. He has also moved closer towards what I believe the government should accept, because he has moved an amendment now only relating to the last section of the government's own amendment—that is, the reference to `genetically identical to the original'. Senator Harradine is asking this committee to accept the closing paragraph to read: </para></talk.start><quote><para>so genetically similar to the original as to be substantially identical.</para></quote><para>In identifying the problem that he had with the government's amendment and now proposing this change to the latter part only of the government's amendment, I believe Senator Harradine is also addressing an issue that I raised in relation to this same definition of the cloning of a whole human being, in that the process of transferring any gene or any string of DNA across would require a marker. It could be legally argued that the fact of that string of DNA coming across with the marker made it substantially different. I believe in moving in both of those directions: to place the definition in the area where the government believes it should be, and also accepting substantially the government's amendment and only amending that last section. I believe Senator Harradine has come up with an acceptable amendment and I commend it to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21168</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I state again for the record the fact that the Australian Democrats have for many years argued the need for government action on the issue of banning human reproductive cloning. So I find myself once again in an interesting position tonight, because my only concern is the relevance of this debate in the context of the Gene Technology Bill. I think the government has made an attempt to respond to some of the justifiable concerns brought forward by Senator Harradine in the context of this debate. He raised these concerns before the debate commenced last Thursday night and had his amendments available to us. The issue of a definition of human reproductive cloning is a complex one. It is one that we should spend more time on, and I do not mean this evening or in the early hours of the morning. I think that we should take into account the public consultations that have occurred and the work of the NHMRC and the AHEC. Senator Harris, I take on board your comments in relation to the definition. I know that Senator Harradine has worked hard to come up with a definition, and I acknowledge the government has, but I want to spend more time on this. This is not the time to be having this debate.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I again want to reiterate for the record that the Democrats have been very vocal on this issue for many years. I actually looked up an article that I wrote for the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in June 1998, where I said:</para><quote><para>... unfortunately he—</para></quote><para>meaning the Minister for Health and Family Services, Minister Wooldridge—</para><quote><para>has taken no action to prevent human cloning beyond the scope of existing regulation.</para></quote><para>So I acknowledge that there is a role for the parliament in determining in legislation that human reproductive cloning is banned. I am glad that the government and others in the chamber recognise the difference between human therapeutic cloning, and its potential and dazzling benefits, and human reproductive cloning. This is a debate I look forward to having. I tried many years ago, in fact on a couple of occasions, to have a Senate select committee inquiry into some of these issues, and I thank Senator Harradine for his support on those occasions. Labor and Liberal both voted against that proposal on at least two occasions. But this is not the time to come up with a definition of human reproductive cloning and it is not the bill in which to ban it. I look forward to a government commitment to introduce separate legislation to do just that. I find it odd that the government would argue against Senator Harradine's amendments earlier this week not only on the grounds of difficulties with the definition but on the grounds of relevance and then respond to that with an amendment that I would consider equally hastily drafted. </para><para>We know from the legislation that does exist in three of the states that human reproductive cloning is in essence banned and that the definitions that have been developed in a hasty fashion have caused problems—because of the nature of this technology, because of the fact that the science is happening so quickly. I am going to assume the bona fides of the government on this one. I am going to assume that Senator Tambling on behalf of the government is committed to banning human reproductive cloning in law. Certainly he has provided us much too much information about his own personal health experiences tonight—very interesting, Minister. I thought a knee reconstruction was good; but, no—you have certainly impressed us all. I am going to assume that the government is committed to this course of action. I do not think the government should have introduced `counter amendments', if you like, because I am not satisfied with the government amendments in their current form. Therefore, I do not see a need currently for Senator Harradine to amend those amendments put forward by government.</para><para>I actually think we should take some time out, we should wait for the report of the Andrews committee. I have already put on record some of my concerns with that committee process, and I have already cited some excerpts from the Academy of Science submission to that committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Through you, Chair, to Senator Harradine: I know that there are vested interests too. I think there are also vested interests provided by those witnesses who appeared before the committee and who are not scientists. But I am one of the first people to acknowledge that we should take science out of the realm of simply the experts, that the community has to be involved in any legislative debate on science policy and science matters. That is why we should return to the substance of the <inline ref="R1069">Gene Technology Bill 2000</inline> debate and we should be urging the government to adopt the amendments put forward by Senators Harris and Brown and me, on behalf of the Democrats, which actually give the public some reason to have faith in the national regulatory framework that we are trying to develop for GMOs. That is not to say I am against banning human reproductive cloning, because for a long time I have been in favour of such legislative action. But this is not the bill in which to do it; this is not the time frame in which to do it—certainly not 9 o'clock on the last night of the Senate session for this year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want us to include the community and I want it to be a much more well thought out process than what we have here, not because I doubt the commitment of those who are in the chamber, but I do doubt the commitment of the two old parties on this issue. That is why we find ourselves tonight debating this legislation when everyone else has either taken pairs to go home or has wanted to get their legislation, which they saw as more important or faster, over and done with. Chair, I have already put on the record that I am appalled—as is my party—by the way that this bill has been pushed aside, that the crossbench amendments have been dealt with in a peripheral fashion in an attempt to just speed this process up and rubber-stamp the Labor-Liberal deal. I think the public are much more concerned about the regulation of genetically modified organisms and GM foods. I think they are much more concerned than that. I am sure that anyone in this chamber who has looked at their emails over the past couple of days would know that.</para><para>So I would like to move on from the human reproductive-cloning debate, as much as I think it is important and as much as I have tried, since my first days in this place back in 1995, to debate these issues. So in some respects it breaks my heart that we cannot have a substantial debate about it at the moment. But I do recognise that we are dealing with legislation that is related but that it is not necessarily the best place in which to have this debate. So I put on record congratulations for Senator Harradine for raising the issues and for those people who support his amendments, but I find it a little odd that the government feels that it has had to offer a counter-argument, as opposed to giving a commitment to develop legislation that would deal with this issue in a much more comprehensive and publicly inclusive fashion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>21170</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will get back to the amendment that is before the chamber.

That is, that we did not think at the outset that it was appropriate that we seek to include in this legislation provisions along the lines suggested by Senator Harradine to deal with that complex issue of human cloning. We dealt with the issue the other night when we debated the government's amendment and rejected the first amendment put by Senator Harradine.</para></talk.start><para>I have to say I find myself somewhat in agreement with some of the comments made by Senator Stott Despoja about the position that was adopted by the government to try to clarify it, as it were, and, I think, to try to respond to reach some level of agreement with Senator Harradine. We were happy to support that because of the reasons that were specifically outlined, that the definition came from the NHMRC and was grounded in the area of that authority and it was a recognised definition from the World Health Organisation.</para><para>I understand that Senator Harradine believes that is inappropriate or insufficient, but that is a debate that needs to be had at another time in other legislation. I think we fall into the danger here of trying to draft legislation on the run. Rather, the various issues that have been raised in this bill and in all of the other amendments are ones, whether you agree or disagree with the various amendments being put forward by the various parties in the Senate, that have been out there in the public arena and before senators in one way or another for some time through the committee process and through the actual presentation of the legislation itself to the chamber. These are issues—as important as they may be, and as much as I respect Senator Harradine for the views that he holds on this issue, which I think are shared by all of us in respect of prohibiting human cloning—that have essentially been introduced into this debate on this legislation at the 11th hour.

But, frankly, I do disagree entirely with the impression that has been given to the states and the statement also that was made by the officer in the tabled document on the need to draw a basic distinction between cloning of whole human beings and therapeutic cloning. I think this is where the misunderstanding takes place. </para></talk.start><para>Therapeutic cloning is used by the Academy of Science as including the cloning of human embryos for experimentation or therapy but not the development beyond eight weeks, when they become foetuses. Quite frankly, that is certainly not what AHEC was saying. The parliamentary secretary referred to the distinction that was made between the cloning of human beings and human tissue—that is what the Australian Health Ethics Committee was about—and human tissue is not a human embryo. So I think there is a complete misunderstanding; obviously in the mind of Dr Morrison there is a misunderstanding. My worry is that that misunderstanding is going to go to the state people that will be involved. Furthermore, that is made perfectly clear later on in that document where it talks about a distinction being drawn between the cloning of human wholes and the cloning of component parts of a human being. That did not mean cloning human embryos; they were cloning human parts. As a scientist friend of mine who today sent me a very interesting document about that said: </para><quote><para>As "whole" and "part" are antonyms, there is no scope for having entities which are in between, or neither whole nor part. It will be ridiculous, both semantically and biologically to classify an embryo, irrespective of whether it is a single cell zygote or late blastocyst of hundreds of cells, as a part.</para></quote><para>I will leave it at that. </para><para>I think it is necessary, however, to reiterate what the Australian Health Ethics Committee in its report of December 1998 recommended in its advice to the minister for health, that advice being on human cloning, that there be legislation in accordance with the NHMRC 1996 guidelines for assisted reproductive technology. Now, 11.1 of these guidelines prohibits developing a human embryo other than for an approved ART treatment. Of course, that is a problem, but it cannot involve this piece of legislation because this is GMO legislation. The developing of a human embryo there does not involve cloning in an ART program. Thus, producing embryos is limited to producing them for transfer to a woman in order that she might become pregnant. Hence deliberately producing human embryos for research or other non-ART procedures such as for harvesting stem cells and culturing tissue for transplantation is to be prohibited. The NHMRC thus recommends limiting experimentation on embryos to spare embryos. Again, that is a problem, but it cannot be dealt with in this legislation. </para><para>AHEC also recommends banning cloning in the terms of the UNESCO 1997 Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, which at least means not cloning embryos for use in an ART treatment procedure. UNESCO did not make the therapeutic reproductive cloning distinction but called for a ban on reproductive cloning without specifying the meaning. In fact, AHEC does not make that distinction either. Do I hear from the parliamentary secretary that the scientific experts are satisfied—obviously the NHMRC and health department are satisfied—that the definition of cloning you have adopted, which I am trying to amend, is scientifically accurate? If that is the case, I will withdraw the amendment I am putting forward. There is no point in carrying on about it and we ought to be able to get back to the other areas in this legislation, after one more thing which should not take more than about seven minutes or so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>21171</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harradine for his comments in that regard and also the question that he has raised.

I will go back to my scientific colleague again and read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what he said about the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Monday, 4 December 2000 in respect of a whole human being:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Reference is made to several points in the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Monday, 4 December 2000 to a "whole human being".

This interpretation would be consistent with the terminology adopted in the AHEC report of 16 December, 1998. The distinction was drawn in the opening paragraph (1.1) of that report as follows: "There is an international consensus that a distinction should be drawn between two categories of cloning: cloning of a human being and copying (cloning) of human component <inline font-style="italic">parts</inline> (italics in original) such as DNA and cells" ...</para><para>When the issue before the chamber is presented as a definition of what may be permissible rather than that of what is prohibited, the answer must be procedures undertaken on parts, the semantic distinction intended by AHEC.

For example, in regard to Ingard, genetically modified cotton, it would be impossible to say that all dealings with the GM cotton would occur in specified locations. This is because the dealings would include transport of the cotton crop, milling of cotton, storing of cotton and all the things that may be done with cotton through growing, harvesting, transporting, packaging, selling and domestic use. It is clearly ridiculous to suggest that the licence should prescribe precisely where all of these activities take place. The regulator must have discretion to impose appropriate conditions on a case by case basis, and the government therefore opposes the amendments. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>21174</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to explore some of the extremely important issues that Senator Tambling has just raised in relation to cotton. I draw the honourable senator's attention to a bill which the government has recently passed through this chamber relating to the tobacco industry. What does the government require there? The government requires a person who is dealing with tobacco not only to have a licence to plant and grow it but also to have a licence to drive down the road to pick up the seed. Then, if they want to plant that seed on a property different from the one nominated on the licence, they need a licence to transport it to that property and a licence to grow it on the second property. When they are harvesting it, they then need a licence to move it as well.</para></talk.start><para>What Senator Tambling is claiming is unworkable in this bill is apparently extremely workable in the tobacco industry. To my knowledge tobacco is not genetically modified. So we have the situation where one industry is required to have licences to drive down the road with a product that is not genetically modified; yet Senator Tambling is saying that it is impossible to control or to issue licences to people who are going to have the authority to release into the environment a genetically modified product. The two situations are opposites. If ever there is an industry that should be licensed for everywhere they plant and everywhere they cart, it should be a product that is genetically modified. You only have to drive around Central Queensland when the cotton is being harvested to find the product strewn along the road. This makes Senator Brown's amendment vital. People who wish to produce genetically modified cotton should be required to contain that product within the vehicles as they travel down the road, and should be licensed to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>21174</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The whole point is that, if this industry is going to be properly regulated without causing damage to the organic farming industry and to agriculture which is not genetically engineered, then it needs tracing. There is a responsibility on those who plant GE crops to see that they are traced all the way through to the Kelloggs cornflakes box. If they are not, then the damage penalties can run into hundreds of millions of dollars, as was recently seen in the United States. If this industry is going to be properly regulated, it has to be responsible for where the genetically engineered material ends up because the world and consumer markets say, `We want GE free produce. We want GE free food.' The only way you can guarantee that is by keeping the GE contaminated product separate. Who does the responsibility go to? It goes to those who want to grow and deal in GE products.</para></talk.start><para>This amendment says `Let us have a start to that process. For those people who get licences to put crops in certain geographical areas, this is where they have to keep them. If they are going to move their crops, then they have to have a licence for that as well.' This amendment is very important. It is clear the government is not going to support it. I expect the Labor Party might be able to follow the logic a bit better than the government. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>21174</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly in response to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care said—that is, basically that licence holders have to be determined on a case by case basis—this amendment does not stop that case by case process. What it says, simply, is that, once you have determined the geographic area in which someone is growing a genetic material, then they have to carry out what they have applied for in the licence in that specific geographic area. It is just holding them predictably and presumably to the information they were already providing when they applied for the licence. I do not see why this is such a problem for the government. </para></talk.start><para>I suggest that Senator Tambling getting frustrated by the fact that Senator Harris may pop up to speak on this amendment—when we are deliberately trying to get through the 40-odd amendments quickly—is not going to endear him to the crossbenches. I say that because we have accommodated this debate in that it has been put on not at 7.30 p.m., as originally scheduled a couple of days ago, but at 8.30 p.m. on the last sitting night of the year. It has been designed—we are not on broadcast, for a start—in a way that gets rid of the so-called peripheral amendments of the crossbenchers, amendments which, in most cases—certainly some of those put forward by Senator Harris—reflect the recommendations outlined in the majority report of the committee that investigated this bill. Those amendments are quickly being abandoned in most cases by the Labor Party, which actually signed off on them. </para><para>Senator Tambling can express his frustration but it is nothing compared to the frustration that some of us on the crossbenches are feeling in relation to the way this debate has been run and it is nothing compared to the frustration that the people of Australia are feeling, especially those who have tried to monitor this debate, given that they have strong feelings about GMOs. This is still one of the most fundamental pieces of legislation that this parliament will address. Yet a simple amendment that would ensure lesser conditions than those that apply to the tobacco industry, as Senator Harris has pointed out, is not acceptable to government. I have already expressed my concern about the way this debate is running. I think that coming back tomorrow may be not such a bad idea if it means that we do not have to fast-track a piece of legislation that is going to give us insufficient standards for the regulation and approval of GMOs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>21175</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will not be supporting these amendments.

What I am requesting is clarification from the government that we are going to be assured, when this bill does proceed and broadacre crops are planted, that one of the requirements—either by legislation or regulation—will be that those crops will be stored separately. If the government is not prepared to make that commitment now, we have serious concerns because of what has happened overseas. You only have to look at the issues that we reiterated the other evening regarding StarLink corn in America where, at this present moment, the industry is trying to recall nine million bushels of corn, because they cannot guarantee that they have not been mixed. I believe that it is perfectly acceptable, when we are passing or considering passing the legislation that will enable this industry to proceed, that we should have from the government an assurance that, when this industry is operating, the public will have confidence that genetically modified and non-modified food products will be separated and stored. If we cannot have that type of assurance from the government at this point in time, what assurance have we got in relation to any conditions in this bill about what would be carried out when these industries are in full production? This is the correct time for the government to make that condition or to make that indication that it will be a requirement. Yesterday, we had discussions in this chamber regarding the Internet gambling bill under which the government indicated to that industry, in a press release, that there was going to be a moratorium. That moratorium was supposedly indicated in December of last year. So the government can, and does, indicate to industries that there will be requirements. I believe it is absolutely essential that the government indicates to anybody who is going to enter into this industry that one of the requirements that they will have will be to guarantee separate storage. That is what we are asking, and I believe that is totally acceptable at this point in the debate of this bill.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>21176</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When Senator Tambling answers that question for Senator Harris, I would like him to also answer a question for me.

This is simply a fair measure which says that the alarm and concern in the community about the failure to properly regulate GMOs can be assuaged insofar as at least people will know that, if their wellbeing is threatened, there is a liability on the person from whom that threat comes that can be backed up and is backed up by insurance. I would like to hear an argument against that. This amendment is compelling and is essential if people are going to have faith in this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>21177</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This amendment proposes that it be a condition of licence that all licence holders be insured.

I would also take this time to comment on the amendment that the Labor Party has indicated it will move, the wording of which is similar to both the Greens amendment and the Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment. Where they differ substantially in their intent and effect is that the Labor Party amendment allows the Gene Technology Regulator the ability to decide whether insurance should be required as a part of the licence. I will just read the first line in the foreshadowed Labor amendment, which says in part:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Licence conditions may also include conditions requiring the licence holder to be adequately insured ...</para></quote><para>However, the clear intent of the amendments of both the Greens and Pauline Hanson's One Nation is as stated in the Greens amendment, which is: </para><quote><para>It is a condition of a licence that the licence holder be insured for all loss or damage to human health, property or the environment that may be caused by the licensed dealing with the GMO or GM product.</para></quote><para>So we have two totally different positions that we are coming from. The government have indicated that they will accept the Labor Party's amendment. I believe that part of the reason for that is that the insurance industry itself has clearly indicated that it has concerns relating to its exposure, should it accept insurance for genetic modification or the production of genetically modified organisms. The insurance industry is a very good measure when you are looking at whether a certain industry should or should not proceed. If the assessment of the insurance industry is such that the risk is too great for them to be exposed to, that is a clear indication that there are concerns about that operation.</para><para>So rather than have the situation where there is an independent assessment of a risk, by supporting the Labor Party's amendment the government will have the situation where these high-risk dealings with genetically modified organisms may be able to proceed without insurance—whereas it is very clear from the Greens amendment and the One Nation amendment that, if the insurance were not available, that action would not be able to be carried out. I believe that is the correct process. I would like to quote a couple of sections from an article that appeared in Switzerland on 6 September 1998. It is headed `Insurance companies fear because of genetic engineering'. It says:</para><quote><para>The Swiss reinsurance company Rueck rings alarm in a study ...</para></quote><para>This study is by one of the leading people in Europe. The article, which is a translation, goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Zurich - Never before it was expressed so clearly as by the Swiss reinsurance company Rueck: The risks of genetic engineering cannot be insured anymore with traditional means.</para></quote><para>So even the insurance industry is saying that they cannot approach the insurance of genetically modified organisms by traditional means. The article goes on to quote author Thomas Epprecht in the <inline font-style="italic">Sonntagszeitung</inline>:</para><quote><para>The tone: The potential risks of genetic engineering can not be covered with classical liability insurance models: "No, whatsoever high insurance coverage is capable to reduce the potential risk of genetic engineering.</para><para>The focal point of the rigorous analysis are the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food companies, which are applying unproportionally genetic technologies without in most cases being insured themselves against likely Genetic-damages. Therefore the Swiss Rueck not only on a global level intends to alert the primary level of the insured, but also the second level, industry and society.</para></quote><para>So the insurance industry—not only at the primary level that would carry the initial insurance but also at the secondary level, the large reinsurance companies—is expressing concern. If the insurance companies are saying they are not willing to insure these large broadacre productions of genetically modified organisms because the risk is too high, it is clearly an indication to the government and to the opposition that, if they go forward with this intention to support Labor's amendment that the Gene Technology Regulator only may require insurance, they are allowing the exposure to the environment of risks that the insurance industry themselves clearly show are unacceptable.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>22:04:00</time.stamp><para>The committee  divided.       </para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.M.

Part of the reason that we believe they should all be insured is that scientific evidence is showing us that there are side effects that we do not totally understand at the moment. Professor Arpad Pusztai at the Rowett Research Institute in Scotland found in experiments that the development of the brain, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and immune system were impaired in baby rats fed on genetically modified potatoes. At Cornell University, they discovered that monarch butterflies had a 50 per cent increase in mortality after eating leaves that had GE pollen on them. They were not the GE altered crops; they were just neighbouring crops that had GE pollen on them. I am using those two instances to raise the issue of what is actually unknown in relation to genetically engineered organisms. I indicate that I will support Labor's amendment. I commend them for having negotiated this amendment with the government, but I put on record that it would have been far more appropriate if insurance had been a condition of the licence and not an assessment of the Gene Technology Regulator. </para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>—We will proceed with Pauline Hanson's One Nation's amendment (36) on sheet 2030.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>21180</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I withdraw amendment (36).</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We will go back to page 1 of the running sheet and deal with opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 2026.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>21180</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 2026:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 2 (line 1), omit "subsection (3)", substitute "subsections (2A) and (3)".</para><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 2 (after line 2), after subclause (2), insert:</para><para>	(2A)	Division 3 of Part 9 commences immediately after the <inline font-style="italic">Gene Technology (Licence Charges) Act 2000</inline> commences.</para></quote><para>These amendments deal with the issue of cost recovery. Our amendments are drafted to take cognisance of the fact that the biggest barrier that industry, research institutions and scientists in this country see to the appropriate development of gene technology is the government's policy of 100 per cent cost recovery. That strong view emerged very clearly in submissions to the Senate inquiry, in the evidence given at the public meetings and in various other consultations and discussions that we have had with representatives from both industry and science areas. Industry has made it very clear to us that if the 100 per cent cost recovery policy is implemented, particularly in the initial set-up period, the likelihood will be that Australia will miss out on what is clearly going to be a substantial area of business and research in coming years throughout the world. Simply put, 100 per cent cost recovery would be a barrier to Australian companies and overseas companies pursuing development of this technology in Australia. We are also very concerned that this policy will damage our own scientists, our own researchers, PhD students and others who are working in the field and who have made major breakthroughs in areas particularly associated with biotechnology. </para><para>We are opposed to 100 per cent cost recovery. We have said that all along. We made those points in the majority report of the Senate committee. We are also concerned that the implementation of 100 per cent cost recovery erodes the independence of the regulator or certainly could create the perception that the independence of the regulator was less than otherwise desired. We have amendments both to this bill and to the Gene Technology (Licence Charges) Bill which would seek to defer any cost recovery until such time as the Productivity Commission report into cost recovery arrangements of government regulatory, administrative and information agencies delivers its findings in August 2001. We have endeavoured over a period of time to convince the government that they should adopt our amendments. I understand that the government are prepared to make a statement this evening about their approach to implementing any cost recovery measures in this legislation. On that basis, I leave any further comments I have until the government indicate their position. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>21180</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats support the amendments that are before us, agreed to by government and moved by the Labor Party.

I think these are good amendments—a good start. But I place on record that we will monitor the feedback from KPMG and the Productivity Commission et cetera reports, and we think there is a very strong role for this body to be independent and perceived to be an independent regulator. We have already put on the record in the committee stage of the debate and also in the committee inquiry the concerns we have currently about the lack of perceived independent and rigorous scientific testing of applications that come from those people who might be applying for a licence. So I look forward to seeing the government provide funding for this body, and I think that is one way of instilling some of that public confidence to which I earlier referred—that is, if people are going to feel that this framework is working for them and that it is not held captive to the interests of industry and some of those huge multinational companies that have been mentioned in this debate already. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>21181</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate the views and the concerns that have been expressed in the debate by both the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats.

Here we have the destruction of the world's tallest hardwood forests, the wildlife in them, eagle nesting sites, the habitat of rare and endangered species, all the understorey and the rainforest underneath—the whole living ecosystem which has been evolving and persisting there over thousands of years—by a process of woodchipping, firebombing and poisoning, and this government calls that ecologically sustainable. That is dishonest. That is shameful. That is deceitful. That is a cheat. And it shows what we are going to get further out of this legislation. </para></talk.start><para>This government is saying under this legislation that the destruction of forests in Australia—and it will extend right through to woodlands in Queensland and forests in south-west Western Australia—is going to be permitted in order to produce electricity which is then going to be called ecologically sustainable and sold to the public as green energy. I do not know how Senator Hill as minister for the environment can look the Senate in the face on that one. No wonder the world is starting to see Australia as an environmental maverick. No wonder, Senator Hill, that at the recent World Conservation Union conference in Jordan, despite your best efforts to put somebody unknown to the public onto the global council of the world's most prestigious conservation body, the world elected Christine Milne from Tasmania, who is a defender of these forests, and voted your candidate last. I am talking about government voters as well as conservation voters. </para><para>But that is not going to help the forests, because the Howard government has got an unfeeling, insensitive, incapable response to what is happening to the monumental forests and woodlands of this country and the wildlife that goes with them. It is an indictment of this government that it does that. The only reason that this government gets away with it is because this opposition supports it; that is why. Where you find the two big parties lining up together, the issue tends to go out of the news pages. Although 80 per cent of Australians do not want this happening, the majority of politicians in this place are gung-ho about it, because behind this is the corruption of the big logging companies, with their donations to the political parties and their power of lobbying in the halls of this place. But it is wicked that that is happening. It makes my blood boil. Nothing counts in this place but dollars. And this is a country which holds other values as important. </para><para>So the Valley of the Giants, the Styx River Valley in Tasmania, is earmarked to be logged from end to end under the Howard government's regional forest agreement with the Tasmanian Labor Party, which is gung-ho about it as well. And we have got this legislation saying that they can build a furnace over the ridge in Judbury and put 300,000 tonnes of woodchips out of these wild forests into that each year and sell the power through Basslink up the line to unsuspecting Melburnians as green energy. The Tasmanian Labor Party, hand in hand with Mr Howard's government, says that if you stand up against that you are unTasmanian. There will be a protest in Hobart on Sunday from people in the areas to the south of Hobart which will show a truly Tasmanian point of view against this corrupt process which has the minister for the environment in this country saying that the destruction of the Valley of the Giants, the forests of the Picton, the Huon and the Weld, in the way that I have just described is ecologically sustainable.  </para><para>I have canvassed the heart of why this legislation is so rotten and why the deal that Labor is going into with the government to get this legislation through is so rotten. It should have been so good. The motivation is to give a fillip to truly ecologically sustainable energy, solar power and wind power, in this country. But the government has determined, under the suasion of the woodchip industry, to put forests through furnaces and to put the electricity production from that into the list of things that is allowable under this ecologically sustainable process. Well, there it is.

Given that that is your definition at this point in time, subject to further regulation, wood waste in respect of this amendment to the bill is very open ended because it leaves it open to waste from both native forest harvesting and plantation harvesting. I notice the Democrats have an amendment—I am not sure when we are going to deal with that—on sheet 2091, which goes to the question of non-plantation native forest wood products and wood wastes. I find that intriguing to say the least, given that the amendment here moved by the Democrats has already been accepted. Where I have a concern with this is that the definition listed as (f) is very broad and could well lead to significant problems, with misuse of a whole range of forest products that are derived from either native or plantation forests. I think that this bill would be much better served not necessarily through regulation but, in the first instance, by having a definition that went very specifically to what forest residue is and what wood waste is.</para></talk.start><para>In most states that have hardwood forest operations, definitions are gazetted at a state level that would cover this sort of issue. I put it to the government that not only is it essential that we have very clear definitions in this bill but it is also very important that we have a mechanism for policing those definitions. This is one of the issues that I have come across in respect of regional forest agreements. I had a `good' experience from the government minister of the day, Mr Wilson Tuckey, in respect of RFAs. The department puts out a regional forest agreement newsletter, which states that there is a Regional Forest Agreement Monitoring Unit that is supposed to monitor the application of the regional forest agreement. The newsletter lists contact phone numbers and the people you can speak to. I rang the monitoring unit to raise with them some issues of concern that I had. I asked them if they had ever been to Tasmania to inspect the forests to see whether or not the criteria set out in the regional forest agreement, particularly as it goes to ecologically sustainable management, had been adhered to—and they said no. So I invited them to come down to Tasmania—as I would invite them to Victoria, to New South Wales and to any other state that currently has a regional forest agreement. I do not want to misrepresent them, but I think they told me that they had never conducted an in-field inspection. That really worries me, because practices are going on that are clearly not within the criteria—poor as they are—that are contained within a regional forest agreement.</para><para>After I invited the Regional Forest Agreement Monitoring Unit to come and do an inspection in-field, they said, `We'll have to get back to you. We'll have to speak to our superior.' They did not say the minister, I do not think, but then I received a letter from the minister, Mr Wilson Tuckey, who accused me of harassing his officers. Bear in mind that this big, glossy newsletter promotes to the Australian public a process of consultation, a process of input. That is, if the Australian public in any state have some reason to think that the criteria of the regional forest agreement is not being met, there is a process through which they can have input and through which they can object and raise concerns, which will be dealt with. But this is not so. As I said, the minister wrote a letter to me which, coming from a member of this federal parliament, was absolutely ridiculous. I probably should have brought the letter down here to the chamber to read out to people. I say to Senator Hill as minister for the environment that this is unacceptable. With regard to federal guidelines, federal law or a federal-state agreement—as is the case with a regional forest agreement—if you are going to set criteria which you expect the state to adhere to and if it is not being adhered to, or if it is alleged that it is not being adhered to, then you must have a process for checking this, for checking the veracity of the circumstances—and likewise with this bill. </para><para>What does wood waste mean? Let me tell you. In the last five years in this country, there has been a huge growth in plantation forestry, with no real strategic plan as to what will happen to a lot of that wood in five, 10, 15 or 20 years time. I have the view that we ought to be developing our industry in terms of value adding, import replacement, et cetera. But, if we allow the opportunity to exist whereby an industry can have wood available to it at a reasonable price because of the global demand for a particular wood product, then we will have a real problem. The problem will be that that wood will be funnelled into biomass energy plants, either in a dual sense or in a singular sense. That is a real problem. </para><para>With regard to the definition of wood waste, I cannot accept that we adopt the position that the Democrats have of using `non-plantation native forests, wood products and wood waste'. If we are to use wood or forest residue as a biomass energy source, then we ought to define it very clearly in the interests of the timber industry in this country. I am not sure that having regulations that are disallowable will do that. We have got to go one step further. We really have to monitor this industry very carefully, but we have to have a monitoring process that has some teeth in it. Once these power plants are built and are linked to some form of employment, I doubt that any government will want to say, `Sorry, the resource that you have been using as a source of biomass is now no longer acceptable.' It will not work. That is a real problem and it is a problem that we ought to address now and not some five or 10 years down the track when it is too late. That is the issue that this bill has to confront. It is not confronting it at the moment.</para><para>I know that the Democrats and Senator Brown have a very significant position in that they do not want to see native forest residue or native forest wood waste used at all. To me, that is a totally unacceptable position. We need to define what can be used and what cannot be used. We should do that in this bill, if we are to deliver good outcomes from what is a very important piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>21187</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do appreciate where Senator Murphy is coming from in this debate. I recognise him as a supporter of the forestry industry and as someone who has also demanded not only that forest management plans be ecologically sustainable but that they should be implemented in a way that is consistent with those goals. Many of the concerns which Senator Murphy expresses today and which I have heard him express before are concerns that show, in implementation of the plans, that there is insufficient monitoring and supervision and the like to ensure that the spirit of the law is reflected in the letter of the law. I do not quarrel with him on that. It is important that sustainable plans are implemented in that way. In many ways, it gets back to responsibilities of states, but Senator Murphy also says that, if the Commonwealth enters into an RFA, perhaps the Commonwealth should take greater responsibility as well. The Commonwealth does have powers under the RFA if the states are breaching their obligations in relation to implementing sustainable forestry practices.</para></talk.start><para>However, it was the government's intention not to even include categories such as this in the bill itself but rather to do the whole of the categorisation and the detail in regulations. This is a provision which was passed previously by the Senate. It sets out a category of wood waste and it will be capable of being further defined in the regulations. Certainly, on this side of the chamber we are happy to talk to Senator Murphy in the development of those regulations in an effort to see that they might meet his objectives. Even so, there is an issue beyond the letter of the law here—that is, the issue of proper management and enforcement. But I would respectfully suggest to Senator Murphy that that goes beyond the scope of this particular bill. I acknowledge the problem, but I am suggesting that this is not the place to solve it. In relation to Senator Allison's point, by virtue of the exclusions that appear in this clause—that is, sources that are not eligible which are fossil fuels or product derived from fossil fuels—it is obvious that, in the case of co-firing, it is only the renewable element that attracts the benefit. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>21188</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the minister: did the Business Council say that it did not want woodchips in this bill? What part has the New South Wales Forest Products Association had in seeking the government's assurance that the reverse would happen and that woodchips would stay in the bill? Also, the government advised that it thought that the woodchips would take up a maximum of three per cent of the renewable energy growth that we are looking at, but my office has done a quick assessment of proposals that have surfaced in recent times. In Tasmania, the Southwood project at Judbury of 30 megawatts would consume 300,000 cubic metres or tonnes of woodchips. In Victoria at Morwell there is the 35 megawatt project for up to 350,000 cubic metres; in New South Wales at Moruya, 300,000 tonnes; at Grafton, 300,000 tonnes; at Raymond Terrace, 300,000 tonnes or cubic metres; in Queensland at Maryborough it is the same, 300,000 tonnes. This does not include the prospect of two other similar generating stations in the north-west and north-east of Tasmania. That comes to 185 megawatts or 1.85 million cubic metres of woodchips, which is equivalent to 15 per cent of the 9,500 gigawatt hour target that this bill incorporates. Under the amendments that are being dealt with here tonight, if the bill goes through as amended, what will be the limit that is going to be placed on the burning of so-called forest waste, remembering that wherever that is certified under this legislation, it is solar power or wind power that is going to lose out?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>21188</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is not a cap as such in this legislation.

I do not know the Business Council's position in relation to woodchips or whether they have a position. In relation to forest industry bodies generally—Senator Brown referred to a New South Wales body—it is true that the forest industry bodies do not wish to have wood wastes excluded from this legislation.

Firstly, I cannot see any purpose; secondly, it seems to me to be possibly confusing and gives the wrong kind of signal about what we are talking about here in terms of sources, not methods of generating electricity.

One thing I will say about Senator Murphy is that he does have a very deep understanding of the problems within the Tasmanian forest industry. I do not come to the same conclusions as him but I respect his understanding, and he is dead right: it is a pity that people on both sides of the chamber do not share that knowledge and are not savvy with the mismanagement that is rampant in the forest industries around the country, not least in Tasmania. This year in Tasmania five million tonnes of woodchips will be exported overseas, coming from 150,000 trucks drawing them out of the great forests of Tasmania, which are being decimated at the greatest rate in history, for the lowest price in history, for the fewest jobs in history. That is what Mr Howard and Premier Bacon got together and signed the prescription for in 1998.</para></talk.start><para>Now Senator Hill, the minister for the environment, is telling us that we will be able to have these forests divided up, with 60 per cent off to the woodchip mill and 40 per cent off to the furnace to create electricity, and that will be called ecologically sustainable. I agree with Senator Allison on the matter, not with Senator Murphy. That is different from not respecting Senator Murphy's knowledge of the mismanagement and corruption that occurs in the Tasmanian forest industry, which ought to be subject of a royal commission. That having been said, this is an important amendment. It is very similar to an amendment I moved when the bill was originally before the Senate. It would protect native forests from being slaughtered, fed into furnaces—and, through Basslink, as far as Tasmania is concerned into the Melbourne market—and as I read out earlier, to suffer the same fate as all the other forest estates, and the woodlands of Queensland as well. </para><para>One thing Senator Murphy will know is that, when the woodchip industry set up in New South Wales and Western Australia and then Tasmania in 1969 and 1970, it promised to take the waste up to the sawmilling. But it very quickly became the core taker of the whole forest, and the sawmill industry was left on the periphery. You have to learn from that. Now we are faced with a potentially voracious furnacing of forests to create electricity, a new market that may very well leave pulpwood on the periphery. Senator Murphy says that six million tonnes of residue is burned on the ground in Tasmania each year and that is not going to change very much. That is not what this industry is after. It wants logs. It wants to put them into furnaces and it wants to burn them to make power. It is an economically run industry; it is not an environmentally run industry. One of the reasons for that is that we do not have an environment minister who will stand up for the forests.</para><para>The minister has brought on this legislation tonight. I agree with Senator Murphy: it should have been brought on in the new year. It has the whole parliament waiting. But he has brought it on knowing how important this matter is to the environmentally minded parties, the Greens and the Democrats, in particular. It is a core issue for us. It is fundamental. One of the great tragedies of modern Australia is this destruction of forests and woodlands, and here we are being asked to put our imprimatur on a new, potent, destructive agent of the natural realm of Australia.

We have had it many times over and over. But I do object to Senator Murphy suggesting that he is the only one in this place who knows anything about forests. That is clearly nonsense. We have all been out into forests and we all know what happens. To suggest that this measure, if it includes native forest residual material, will solve the problem of burning residue on the forest floor is wrong; it will not. The only way we will stop that problem is to stop clear-fell logging so that we do not end up with treetops and every growing matter in the forests being knocked down and left on the forest floor. That is why it is burned. It is not put on trucks and taken somewhere to be woodchipped. That is the great myth put about by the forest industry: that woodchippers were simply taking the residue. We know they do not do just that; they like nice, big, strong, straight logs like the sawmillers do—the fewer bends the better, the fewer the branches, the less rotting material and the less bark, the more the woodchippers like them. So this measure is not going to see trucks trundling down the road in forest areas taking with them the residue off the forest floor. It will still be burned in the same way it is now.</para></talk.start><para>In the same way, this amendment would not stop the use of native forest timbers for burning, for sawmilling, for woodchipping or for anything else. It simply does not give them the advantage that we think renewable energy ought to have—that is, that ought to be primarily wind and solar. What this is doing is likely providing far greater opportunities for what is already a lucrative business, because we charge so little for our native forest timbers. Again, I think Senator Murphy underestimates the degree of interest in this subject by those at this end of the chamber. I have spent a great deal of time in forests, I have seen the operations, I know what happens and I know why the timber is burned on the forest floor; this measure certainly will not stop that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Allison to Senator Bolkus's amendment in lieu of original amendment No. 7 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>23:34:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.

It is one that has been driven by a need for transparency and scrutiny of this legislation, given that there are such great concerns about it. What we are doing with this amendment is ensuring that there is a review of the legislation not after three years, as was initially agreed to by the Senate, but within 12 months after the second anniversary of the commencement of the act. We are talking about some fairly specific provisions that have to be addressed by the reviewer. The independent review is what we are anticipating embodying in this clause. The independence of the review is defined in subclause (4) of proposed section 162. We are talking about, for instance, at least one or more people involved in the review who are not employed by the Commonwealth or in connection with a contract of the Commonwealth. So we are talking about an independent review. The review document has to be written and tabled in parliament after the review is completed. So we have that mechanism to ensure scrutiny and independence of the review.  </para><para>We also specify in this particular provision that the review has to extend to a certain number of issues such as the extent to which the act has contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraged additional generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and the extent to which the policy objectives of the act have been achieved. Importantly, the review has to report on the mix of technologies that have resulted from the provisions of the act. Importantly, also in the context of this debate, the review must report on the level of penalties and the need for indexation. In paragraph (f) we are talking about the review addressing other environmental impacts and particularly important of those and specified in the paragraph is the impact on the non-plantation forestry waste to the extent that that has been utilised. </para><para>What I would like to insist on here is a fairly strong independent review capacity earlier in the piece as opposed to what we had in the previous amendment and one that I think will impose an enormous degree of scrutiny. Together with the other clauses, we will be in a position to know the source of the renewable energy and the degree to which such source has been accessed. This review, within two years, will give the parliament a fairly immediate snapshot of how the legislation is working. I think it is critical that we adopt that. Unless we do know that within two to three years, then there is a real possibility that unforeseen consequences that people, in a sense, are signalling now as being quite possible may in fact eventuate and we may do environmental damage that this legislation should not be doing and this parliament should not be sanctioning. </para><para>I indicate that we want to insist on the pre-existing clause 24 but in an amended form that will ensure that the need for indexation is taken into account by the review and that the review will take place after two years, not after three.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—I do not seem to have that ALP amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—It is on sheet 2094.

This bill is an absolutely tragic piece of legislation, and the opposition should be ashamed of itself for having let the government get away with this. It is an environmental monstrosity. The opposition has failed to give the people of Australia a choice, again. This is going to lead to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tonnes of Australia's wild forests being fed into furnaces and turned out as so-called green energy. It is an absolutely shameful piece of legislation. I am not surprised at it coming from the Howard government, because it has a shameful record, but I would have thought this far into opposition there could have been some distance put between the government and itself by the opposition. But the Labor Party walks hand in hand with Prime Minister Howard on the matter of forests and the environment generally. It is time they put some distance in there.

Secondly, Senator Brown, I think in your previous contribution you acknowledged that this is not easy, and there is a renewable energy industry that actually wants an outcome here tonight. Just a few minutes ago you were advocating that the government start the legislation earlier than April. So there is a bit of inconsistency in you saying now that this is just an obnoxious piece of legislation when three minutes ago you actually wanted it started earlier than is anticipated by the legislation. I understand what your concerns are.

We urge the government to accept this. In a sense, this is not a big price for the government to pay. If you are talking about the next two years leading up to the review, you are talking about $3.50 as the overall amount that would be levied—so it is just over $3—and I am sure industry can accept—and, in order to maintain the real value of the charge, the government should accept—that sort of amount. So we urge the government to be flexible about this. We understand that there are pressures on it, but the real pressure here is for the government to consider ensuring that the real value of their charge is maintained.

Apart from that, I seek to insert the precautionary principle as recommended by the committee that inquired into this bill. It is the precautionary principle that provides that, where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or environmental degradation. I think you will find that that is the best definition of the precautionary principle that has been used in this debate. It is echoed by others on the crossbenches who are moving amendments. I am concerned about the Labor Party amendment that deals with a similar issue but seeks to insert the precautionary principle without reference to health. Perhaps that is a debate that we can have in this context so that we do not have to delay the debate too much longer. I commend the amendments to the Senate. The committee report made it very clear that the majority recommendation of the committee was to include:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The committee recommends that the objects of the bill contain the same words that appear in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in relation to the precautionary principle.</para></quote><para>There is no shortage of information in that committee report to explain why the precautionary principle is not only relevant but fundamental to the bill. That is why some of us in this debate have put on record that we are concerned and disappointed that we have not debated the objects a little earlier.</para><para>I think there are many more pressing reasons for the precautionary principle to be included. Obviously, we need to save time because we are all quite tired. It is disappointing that this debate has been rejigged in such a way that senators are too tired and the public was necessarily excluded—and I make that particular point in relation to the broadcast. It was very interesting hearing the House of Representatives members thank the relevant members of their political party et cetera, but I actually think members of the public might have been more interested to tune in to the legislative debates that were taking place in the Senate tonight. Nonetheless, I congratulate the government on making sure this bill was dealt with in a way that minimised public involvement. I am sorry we are not debating these issues which should have been the third amendments that we dealt with—that we did not debate them in a more comprehensive fashion and earlier. I commend the amendments to the Senate, and I hope the Labor Party is not pursuing its amendment, which is clearly a deficient definition of the precautionary principle.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are addressing the issue of objects and precautionary principle. I indicate that the government will oppose the amendments proposed by the Democrats. The government would prefer to deal with this matter in the context of the ALP amendment (3) to clause 4 of the bill. The government is prepared to entertain further enhancement of the bill in terms of a precautionary approach but will do so in the context of that forthcoming amendment. With respect to the Democrats amendment to clause 4 on the precautionary principle, the government does not support the Democrats' referencing of the precautionary principle in clause 4 for two key reasons. Firstly, the terminology used references to human health. This varies from the Rio 15 statement of the precautionary principle, which is limited to taking measures to prevent environmental degradation. Consideration still needs to be given in the international arena as to how the precautionary principle should be applied in the context of public health. The government is reticent to commit Australia to a path that may have difficulties and be inconsistent with international best practice.  </para></talk.start><para>Secondly, the amendment does not incorporate the words `cost-effective' as they appear in Rio 15. The government is, however, prepared to include words taken from Rio 15 in relation to the precautionary principle and will follow this intention through in the context of the ALP amendment to clause 4. The Democrats are proposing a separate definition of `ecological sustainability' in addition to the existing definition in the bill of `environment'. Ecological sustainability refers to the need to use, conserve and enhance the community's resources so that ecological processes on which life depends are maintained and the total quality of life now and in the future can be increased. We do not consider a separate definition is required, because ecological sustainability is not separate and distinct from the environment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We know what `ecologically sustainable' means to this government, because we just debated it in the previous session.

Certainly, if somebody comes along and wants to define them in a way which gives honesty to those terms, then you oppose it. That is what is happening here. I am going to support the Democrat amendments. I think the Green amendment coming after, as far as the object of the act is concerned, is stronger in that it does include that the object of the act should protect the right for non-GMO production systems, including organic systems, to exist. There is a very clear statement not only about the right of the natural environment to exist without being contaminated by genetically engineered organisms but about the right of the organic farming industry to do so. There is the gilt-edged value added frontrunner for growth as far as Australian food production is concerned; and yet it is not explicitly written into the objects we have before us.</para></talk.start><para>The objects as put forward by the Greens would also give local government the ability to determine what happens in its area. We have had that debate before, but the Greens stand by that. We also have a provision for the provisions of the act to be conducted in a transparent way which encourages public participation in decisions concerning the `development, use and release of GMO and GM products'. Of course, doing that at the local level is fundamental.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>21204</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting these amendments of the Democrats. As Senator Stott Despoja correctly identified and as the government referred to, the opposition will be moving an amendment which will insert reference to the precautionary principle in the legislation in clause 4. I do not think I need to speak at length about the importance of having this reference to the precautionary principle in the legislation; it was one of the major issues raised during the Senate inquiry and public hearings. However, I do wish to take up the allegation that has been made by the Democrats that our wording is deficient because it does not refer to human health. I just point out that the wording that we have adopted is essentially the same as that which was picked up in the EPBC Act—neither in that act nor in the Rio declaration is there any reference to human health—and our proposal is consistent with the approach adopted in both that legislation and in the Rio declaration. </para></talk.start><para>The other point I make is that this was another issue which, initially, the government were not prepared to entertain; they did not include in the original legislation or the bill that is before the chamber any reference to the precautionary principle. We believe it is a significant improvement to have that now recognised by the government and indeed all the parties in the Senate. Therefore I should take the opportunity to refute the proposition put forward by the Greens on their web site on 1 December when Senator Bob Brown condemned the ALP—and I quote from the release on the site—by stating the `precautionary principle has been gutted'. If that is the case, Senator Brown must obviously think that the precautionary principle as adopted in the Rio declaration and as included in the EPBC Act has been gutted. That might be his view but, firstly, that is indeed what I understand the Democrats signed up to in terms of that legislation, and, secondly, has been adopted and supported by environmental groups throughout the world in respect of the Rio environmental declaration. Our position is consistent with the approach in both those cases.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>21205</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly in response to Senator Forshaw's contribution, I understand from the government's explanation tonight that cost-effectiveness is going to be discussed or included in the amendment that will be supported by the government tonight.

I would like to very briefly speak to the Democrats amendments, particularly amendment (1), which relates to the objects of the act. The objects of the act are the actual heart of the act because, by going to the objects of the act, substantial argument can be raised in relation to whether a person is in compliance with the act. Rather than being merely an expression of the direction of the act, they have an extremely important role to play; therefore, they must express explicitly the direction of the act and indicate clarity to any judicial person who is ruling on them. That is exactly what Democrats amendment (1) does. Amendment (1) goes to clause 3, `Objects of the act', and reads:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	The objects of this Act are:</para><para>	(a) 	to protect the health and safety of people; and</para><para>	(b) 	to promote ecological sustainability; and</para><para>	(c) 	to protect the environment;</para><para>by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.</para></quote><para>The Democrats second amendment is identical to the amendment that Pauline Hanson's One Nation proposed, which is:</para><quote><para>(a) 	provides that where there are threats of serious or irreversible harm to human health or environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent harm to human health or environmental degradation ...</para></quote><para>With the combination of both of those amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats, there would be clarity in the act and there would be certainty. That is equally important: there would be certainty for the people who are going to operate under that act. To highlight the necessity for certainty, I would like to quote from a paper that was presented on 31 October 2000. The title is `The Precautionary Principle is Coherent'. The paper says: </para><quote><para>We want to emphasise that the precautionary principle is not an algorithm for making decisions. It does not make decisions for us, but it is a principle on which to base decisions. It is a principle for assigning the burden of proof, in much the same way that the defendant in a criminal court is assumed innocent until proven guilty `beyond reasonable doubt'. ... This important rule reflects society's view that convicting the innocent is far worse than acquitting the guilty. It has a profound effect on the outcome of many trials, but it still leaves the jury with a lot to do. They still have to weigh up the evidence, and they have to decide for themselves what constitutes `reasonable doubt'.</para><para>In the same way, the precautionary principle requires us to assign the burden of proof to those who want to introduce a new technology, particularly in cases where there is little or no established need or benefit and where the hazards are serious and irreversible. It is up to the perpetrators to prove that the technology is safe `beyond reasonable doubt'. We cannot expect the precautionary principle by itself to tell us what to do about GM crops or any other new technology. Like a jury, we have to weigh up the evidence, and like a jury we have to come to a decision. ...</para><para>So, what is the evidence on GM crops? There is practically no evidence that they are safe, of the kind that could stand up in a court of law. There is less than a handful of papers on the subject of safety assessment published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The vast majority consists of unpublished reports submitted to regulatory bodies for product approval, and these, far from supporting claims of safety, actually provide evidence to the contrary. ... The published papers from the industry are no better. For example, Monsanto's study on Roundup Ready soya was seriously flawed. The two papers (Hammond et al, 1996, Journal of Nutrition 126, 717-26; and Padgette et al, 1996, Journal of Nutrition 126, 702-16) showed, among other things, significant increases in milk fat in cows and lower weight gains in male rats fed GM soya. There was also a 26.7% increase in a major allergen and growth inhibitor, antitrypsin, in the GM soya. Monsanto had failed to submit even more damning data indicating that another allergen, a soya lectin, was increased by 100% in retoasted soya beans.</para></quote><para>So in promoting the necessity for the precautionary principle, it is very clear that there is a necessity and a requirement for that in this bill. There is clearly scientific evidence which shows that there are dangers relating to genetic manipulation. I would like to return briefly to the issue I raised before about the necessity for the objects of the act to be concise. I would like to refer to some correspondence I received which says:</para><quote><para>My understanding is that the regulator, because of the objects of the act, can only consider and address risk that is in keeping with the objects of the act to protect public health and safety and the environment. Can the regulator address the risk of contamination that is trade related only not public health and safety or environment risk? If so, under what section of the bill? If the regulator can impose conditions to reduce risk of trade related contamination, could the regulator impose buffer zones and segregation of supply chain systems? If the regulator was to impose such conditions that were trade related only, then could the GMO licence applicant take an objection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review on the grounds that the regulator had imposed a condition on a licence that was outside the objects of the act?</para></quote><para>That is what goes to the heart of the necessity to get the objects of the act correct, because if we do not do that then the decisions of the Gene Technology Regulator will be challengeable by appeal.

When we are talking about public confidence in this whole area of gene technology, this amendment proposes something that is weaker than what exists in that act.

As the simplified outline in the bill explains, part 6 of the bill established a mechanism for the regulations to regulate certain dealings with GMOs that do not involve the intentional release of GMOs into the environment. These dealings are called notifiable low-risk dealings. Notifiable low-risk dealings are dealings that the GTR considers to be particularly low risk. This is because the GMO is biologically contained—that is, it has a reduced ability to survive or reproduce in the open environment. It is not pathogenic and does not produce new proteins that are of high risk because they are toxic. </para></talk.start><para>The regulations describe the categories of notifiable low-risk dealings, as well as the requirements and conditions that must be complied with by a person proposing to undertake notifiable low-risk dealings. The Greens amendments propose to delete the streamlined and sensible notifiable low-risk dealings arrangement, as well as the register of GMOs, in part through these amendments but also through amendments yet to be debated but which have been circulated. The register and the notifiable low-risk dealings are important components of the regulatory system. They ensure that the level of regulation can be tailored to the level of risk. The government will not support amendments that would see these categories deleted. The government understands the adverse effect that this would have on Australia's research and development base.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21212</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Who determines that something is not pathogenic or is safe?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21212</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am advised that it is determined on the basis of scientific advice and is considered by the regulator.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>21212</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—So the person who says they have a low-risk operation says that to the regulator, and there it is.

Obviously, he made reference to the research base and research industry. I am wondering if we are talking about work largely based in laboratories or research institutions.

I indicate to him that if he had looked at the <inline font-style="italic">Explanatory guide to the draft Commonwealth Gene Technology Regulations 2000</inline> that were issued to him in August 2000, he would have seen that the issue of notifiable low-risk dealings would only be those that—and let me quote from page 42 of that explanatory guide: </para></talk.start><para>·	have been assessed over time as presenting minimal biosafety risks where such risks can be properly managed through containment of the GMO in a laboratory certified to physical containment level 2.</para><quote><para>For example, some of the factors considered in assessing a GMO to be of lowrisk (with the low risk able to be managed through containment measures) include the extent to which the GMO is ` biologically contained' (because it has a reduced ability to survive or reproduce without human intervention) and the properties of the GMO including the inability of the GMO to be a pathogen or pest or produce toxic proteins.</para></quote><para>·	do not involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment.</para><para>That is the end of the quote from the explanatory guide.

The government will ensure that the committee is by no means hostage to a particular interest group or scientific view. The bill ensures this by providing that the membership of the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee must be very broadly based. Not only must the committee include experts in specific scientific disciplines such as molecular biology, virology, entomology and microbiology, but the legislation also requires experts in areas such as public health, risk assessment and occupational health and safety. Importantly, the committee must also include a layperson. This will ensure that the committee is representative of a range of disciplines and that it is not hijacked by one point of view. The committee will contain members who represent both reductionist perspectives and holistic perspectives, to ensure that all risks are properly identified and assessed on both macro and micro levels.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>21215</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support Labor's amendment.

It is a clean-up clause. It simply puts to rest the great fear that many of us have that it will not be very long at all before this technical advisory committee, which is quite an important one, is simply going to have appointees with a vested interest in the industry. That is a conflict of interest. If we make it clear at the outset that that cannot be so, the public will have faith in this committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>21218</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note the disclosure of interest provisions are already set out in the regulations.

Our amendment will mean that concerns raised about individual applications, either through the public submission process or other forums identified by the regulator, can be referred to the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group for advice.

Pauline Hanson's One Nation has a similar amendment (47). As Senator Forshaw has indicated, it would be the preference of the Labor Party for each individual application to be assessed by this committee. However, he has indicated that those negotiations with the government have failed and, therefore, we now rely on the regulator's request from the consultative group. I believe it would be far more appropriate if the consultative group had the ability to comment on the policy principles, the guidelines, the codes of practice and the technical and procedural guidelines, as well as individual applications. It is very obvious that there is no support from the government for the committee to have, as of right, an ability to comment on individual applications. There is nothing in these amendments that binds the regulator to accept the advice from the consultative group. That would be an improvement to clause 107 of the bill. In speaking to and supporting Labor's amendment, I indicate that I will not proceed with Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment (47).</para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>21219</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(10)	Page 69 (after line 15), after clause 107, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">107A  Citizens' juries</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	The Consultative Committee may appoint a citizens' jury on an ad hoc basis to assist in the performance of its functions.</para><para>	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), a citizens' jury may assist the Consultative Committee to: </para><para>	(a)	formulate advice on a question of policy of significant public interest; or</para><para>	(b)	raise awareness and promote education in relation to an issue of significant public interest.</para><para>	(3)	The Consultative Committee is to appoint 18 members of a citizens' jury with the aim of ensuring that the jury is randomly selected and demographically representative.</para><para>	(4)	The regulations may prescribe matters relating to the following:</para><para>	(a)	the basis for selecting the jury;</para><para>	(b)	the mode of operation of the jury, including procedures for collecting evidence and questioning witnesses;</para><para>	(c)	the preparation of jury reports;</para><para>	(d)	the publication of the jury's findings and recommendations.</para><para>(5)	The Regulator must adopt any recommendation made by a citizens' jury or publish reasons for not doing so.</para></quote><para>This amendment relates to public involvement and public confidence in not only the regulator but also the whole regime and the debate about GMOs, their approval and application processes. I think Senator Tambling and others would be aware of some things that have happened internationally: the bodies, conferences and committees that have been formed to ensure maximum public consultation and input, particularly in the UK. That is basically the concept of a citizens' jury. In Australia, probably the closest thing we have come to it in relation to the debate on GMOs was the consensus conference, which saw a combination of lay people and representatives from industry and various sectors of the population debating some of their concerns and questions about GMOs. </para><para>I have had brief discussions with the government and I understand that this amendment in its current form may not be acceptable. I am happy to listen to the suggestions of the government in relation to how we could pass something that constitutes a similar concept to this; that is, the opportunity to randomly select people from all over Australia and from the standard range of different demographic groups based on geography, educational background, gender, age, ethnicity, et cetera, to participate in these juries. So the 18-member juries would have those characteristics, which I think are necessary to ensure a diverse range of views are reflected and represented in relation to this issue of debate. I ask the government to outline what they are prepared to consider in the form of this amendment—certainly in relation to maximising public participation and consultation. I do commend the concept of citizens' juries and hope that we do follow some of world's best practice—examples of which we are seeing in places like the UK—in relation to this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>21220</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While the government will not support this amendment, the government will agree to establish a consensus conference rather than a citizens' jury.

We have, therefore, in our amendment sought to ensure that locations and sizes of field trials will be disclosed unless there is proof that significant damage to property, human health and the environment would occur as a result of this disclosure. In such a case, the regulator must publish the reasons for withholding the location information.

I note Senator Brown was quite prepared to support our earlier amendments which increased the severity of the penalties where breaches of licence conditions occur. I remind Senator Brown that we actually strengthened those penalties substantially by introducing provision for imprisonment terms of two years for lesser offences and five years for serious offences. Senator Brown was quite happy to support that because such penalties would clearly apply to persons or companies engaged in GMO research or gene technology work; however Senator Brown has just stood up and said that it is appropriate for those who seek to wreck this industry, who seek to damage it, to get off scot-free and not be subject to any real penalty at all. I point out that the penalties contained in our amendment have a maximum term of two years, which is substantially less than the maximum term that is provided in the other section. I think the real proof of Senator Brown's approach in this area has just been demonstrated.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>21230</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is the champion defender of verballing, if you don't mind.

Generally speaking, under criminal law, there needs to be an intention to commit a crime and to do the damage as well.

I am wondering how the regulator would be able to address an issue of assessment of risk in relation to contamination that was trade related, for example, as opposed to being within the objects of the act; that is, the parameters of health, safety and environmental issues.

Even though it moves to give a regulatory framework for the spread of gene technology in Australia, it is weak and therefore it is dangerous. Not only is it dangerous to the Australian environment and potentially to the health of Australians but also it is dangerous to commerce in this country, including the organic farming sector of rural Australia. I said earlier that organic farming is a gilt-edged component of rural industries these days. It is concentrated in family farms, which are big employers in the bush. It also produces high premium produce for Australians and for the overseas market. That market is growing more rapidly than the rest of the export market for primary produce in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Put simply, if genetic contamination goes into farmlands that are registered as organic, they will be finished. That will be the end of the livelihood of those farms. We do not yet know about the long-term hazards of genetic technology to health, but I do not believe it is adequately regulated in this legislation. What we do know is that, largely because of the failure of the opposition to take a strong stand in the matter, this legislation does not require insurance for those people who get licences for GM products, unless the Gene Technology Regulator requires it. It does not protect the natural environment—Australia's flora and fauna—from the spread of genetic contamination. It does not give a clear, comprehensive opt-out clause for the states. That has become a very much more difficult matter—a state becoming GMO free—under this legislation. Local government is denied altogether the power to declare itself as having GE free status.</para><para>The requirement of licensing so-called low-risk dealings, which we did not define in the debate, is gone. That leaves a raft of GE dealings which are not going to be either licensed or available for public scrutiny in the one-stop shop that we hoped to get but are not getting under this legislation. It could have been the standard bearer for GE legislation around the world. It should have been. Basic to that is public confidence that everything is aboveboard and obvious, that risk management is at the fore and that the precautionary principle would be there and would be strong, but the legislation fails to do that. Time and time again those aims have been eroded by either the failure of amendments moved by the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation or by the substitution of weak amendments by the opposition and the government. It failed to set up even a compensation fund for this industry to ensure that if people are injured, they will have at least a dollar recompense. That practice applies with doctors and lawyers, but it does not apply to the purveyors of GMOs in this country.</para><para>The bill falls far short of where it should have been. It even falls short of the standards set by the report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. It is a pity that at the end of the year, we are not celebrating breakthrough legislation on one of the great issues of the age not just for our country but right around the world. I believe we are not celebrating because the big parties are failing to heed public concern about this. They do not have their ears to the ground; they do not understand the rising tide of public concern. We are going to be another country where consumer revolt is going to wake up the body politic to the fact that, while gene technology does have scintillating prospects and great advantages for the human community, it also has its worries as far as our society is concerned. Those worries have not been adequately addressed on this occasion. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>21233</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Democrats, I would like to add that we feel that there has been a lost opportunity here today, that we had an opportunity to pass world's best practice legislation in relation to the regulation of genetic technology. The Democrats outlined in our committee report contribution and in the second reading debate that we believe, in order to maximise the likelihood of public confidence in Australia's gene technology regulatory system, the Gene Technology Regulator should be required to possess a number of characteristics, including independence. Unfortunately, some of the amendments that have been knocked back in the context of this debate, such as making it a three-person body as opposed to a single person, have weakened the opportunity for the regulator to be perceived as independent. </para></talk.start><para>Contributing to public debate was a second feature that we felt was all-important. I acknowledge the government's acceptance of some of the Democrat amendments in that regard—certainly the elevation in our minds of the consultative group to a consultative committee, the ability to form subcommittees and also the notion of a citizens' jury. Whilst that was not accepted, the government committed to support or undertake or implement a consensus conference. However, at all times we have maintained that the only way the public's confidence will be instilled in this regime or be gained or maintained for the benefits of this technology is by ensuring public debate, education and information. We also believed that the regulator had to be a powerful watchdog in order to instil that public confidence in these technologies and the regime. Unfortunately, some of the amendments that were defeated, such as the issue in relation to exempt dealings, have, I think, weakened the bill as a consequence. I think we need to be wary of public backlash as a consequence of having an insufficient or inadequately strong regulator. I think that is something with which the government will have to contend.</para><para>On a final note, the process of this committee stage and the actual debate has saddened me. As I have maintained from the beginning, I think this is one of the most fundamental pieces of legislation that this parliament has dealt with, yet it was relegated to the evening hours or the early morning hours of the Senate time. So I do extend thanks to the attendants, staff, clerks and those advisers on all sides who have stuck with this debate, but I do think the debate has been deficient in some respects as a consequence of the hours at which we have been working. I want to add on a note of sadness but also happiness that in the last month two of my advisers have moved on including my geneticist or molecular biologist, Rebecca Smith, and also Catherine Wolthuizen. Given this is the last opportunity in the context of the Senate to do so, I would like to wish them well and say that I will miss them dearly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21233</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to briefly recap the <inline ref="R1069">Gene Technology Bill 2000</inline> and place on record the disappointment of Pauline Hanson's One Nation that, to a large extent, the issues that have been raised, particularly those relating to the rights of people who will be closely associated with dealings as a result of this bill—that is, the rights of adjoining property owners—have not been recognised; that the insurance issue relating to dealings now is optional—that is, the regulator may now issue a licence for a dealing without requiring insurance on that; and also, and I think substantially, that the powers of the states legislation, and, in this case, particularly those of local governments, again have been eroded by the federal government. It will be interesting to see in the development of this gene technology where the rights of local governments stand. I am aware that the Atherton Shire Council on the tablelands in North Queensland have declared their area GM free. So it will become very interesting to see how the federal legislation from this place overrides the rights of those people in that area to determine that their area remain genetically modified free. </para></talk.start><para>As I said in an earlier part of this debate, we are what we consume.

It has not just been to the credit of the government or to the credit of the parliament; stakeholders from the environmental community, the commercial community and the research community right around Australia have taken a very keen and thorough interest in the development of this legislation. Can I also put on record the government's appreciation of the very sterling work of the departmental officers who have been involved in handling this for some 18 months, particularly those within the Department of Health and Aged Care. They have many compatriots in other departments and agencies with whom there have been very detailed and comprehensive dealings, and I acknowledge the work, the time and the commitment that so many of them have given as well. </para><para>I have no doubt that there will be amendments in the future to this legislation. There will be times when we will revisit it, not just at points of review but also because of fundamental shifts that will happen in the community. We have very obviously reached a new point in the development of a new industry. I would like to reflect on the statement often made by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in which he refers to the 19th century as the century of the Industrial Revolution, the 20th century as the century of information technology and the 21st century as the century of healing. In adopting that point on healing it is very important to acknowledge that the changes that are happening in gene technology will test, confound, challenge and at times disappoint all of us. But I think it is important to recognise that we have reached a watershed in many areas, and we have certainly done that tonight here in the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>21234</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to delay the Senate at this very early hour.

It is not perfect—we all know that—but it is a start. We also have to bear in mind that this legislation would ultimately never have got off the ground and would never have worked if it had not had the involvement of all the state governments as part of a national scheme. That has been a matter that we have always had to have regard to in terms of our approach to moving the amendments. Consequently, I think it is a matter of not how much you say but ultimately what you achieve. Whilst I no doubt think that there will be changes in the future—there will have to be changes as this area develops further—we have established for the first time national legislation over an important area that is going to affect the lives of all of us and our industries for many years to come.  </para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21235</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives acquainting the Senate that it had agreed to the amendments requested by the Senate to the following bill:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R971">Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Bill 2000</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>21235</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Withdrawal</title><page.no>21235</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>21235</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the request of respective senators, I withdraw general business notices of motion Nos 82, 405, 431, 548, 549, 566, 581, 587, 588, 603, 616, 651, 679, 685, 714, 743, 745 and 756.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PUBLIC OPINION POLLING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>21235</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>21235</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>21235</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I said to Senator Faulkner earlier in the day that I would attempt to respond to the return to order instructing me in relation to GST polling.

I commence by saying what a tremendous year it has been for the government and how successful it has been. The implementation of the historic goods and services tax legislation has been a great achievement from which all Australians will benefit. It is a government that is very proud of its achievements over the last four or so years. The goods and services tax, which implemented major taxation reform that had been beyond all previous governments, is perhaps the highlight of that period. It should be understood that enormous benefits will flow from the goods and services tax legislation, particularly in terms of contributing to a more efficient and competitive economy in a global market that is going to require Australia to be particularly efficient.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—You are going to waffle on for about an hour, aren't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—No, only for another 20 minutes. It is necessary for a country such as Australia to be competitive in all spheres of its economy, including taxation. Most Australians have known for a long time that our undue emphasis on taxation of production, when other nation states had moved the balance to a taxation of consumption, has meant that our producers and industries have been at a competitive disadvantage. Yet, despite the fact that that has been obvious to most Australians, it has simply been too politically difficult for previous governments, particularly the previous Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I raise a point of order.

And yes, there are others, such as the whip's clerk, who help make the process of the parliament and our party work efficiently. I would also like to thank those on the other side of the chamber and the crossbenches for the goodwill with which they have contributed to the year's parliamentary work.

We are probably going to have to do a little more next year, but I am sure all honourable senators will appreciate its importance. The sittings of the parliament might not be the only event of political interest next year: we are going to have the highly important celebration of the Centenary of Federation, when we are all going to be part of history in Melbourne.

On this side of the chamber—and I know the government does too—we do acknowledge those who contribute to the smooth running of the Senate. As you would know, Madam President, traditionally I always thank you, the Deputy President and others who preside in this chamber. I always thank the clerks—I am pleased that the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, is at the table—and Dr Rosemary Laing, who assists the opposition and the minor parties in terms of her official responsibilities as clerk assistant. I know that the demands that we place on the clerks are heavy at times. We do appreciate their assistance and the fact that so many of those in the building do always come through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I wish to thank, more generally, the staff of the Department of the Senate, the Table Office, Hansard, the Parliamentary Library, the attendants, the Comcar drivers, the cleaners, the gardeners, the transport officers, the dining room staff, the security staff, the Jetset staff and so many others in this building who assist us and contribute to the effective operation of the parliament. As we know, there always tends to be a focus on the politicians themselves, the parliamentarians themselves, but this place simply would not work without the staff who support us here and we sincerely appreciate all of their efforts.</para><para>I particularly would like to acknowledge the staff of the Senate committees, particularly the legislation committees, who this year have contributed very significantly to what I believe is probably the best accountability mechanism that this parliament has. We do appreciate their efforts. I think we ought to acknowledge that the PLO, Gail Bansemer, who toiled here long and hard, recently left that PLO position for greener pastures. We thank her for her efforts over a significant period of time and welcome Myra Croke, who has replaced her. In relation to the opposition, I thank my deputy, Senator Peter Cook, for his support and for his efforts. I would like to thank the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Kim Carr, who is here at 3.26 a.m. I do not know whether the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is here, but we are managing, as we always have, Senator Carr, to try to show the others how it works.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Opposition senator</inline>—You're a legend, mate.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—He is a legend.

I do, and I know the party more generally does, sincerely thank them for their support and assistance over the past year. I am incredibly impressed that so many of them are here and so many of them are awake—and I am only seven minutes into this very long valedictory speech!</para></talk.start></continue><para>Perhaps on a more serious note, a little earlier in the year one of our colleagues Senator Quirke resigned because of ill health. That was something that gave none of us any joy. I want to acknowledge Senator Quirke's efforts. He has been replaced by Senator Buckland and he is enjoying his role now in the Senate. But I think all my colleagues would want to acknowledge Senator Quirke for his important contribution as part of Labor's Senate team.</para><para>As the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, said, next year will be a busy year with the Centenary of Federation celebrations. Senator Hill failed to mention, I did note, the fact that the federal parliamentary Labor Party will be celebrating its centenary in the year 2001; I think perhaps of more significance than the Centenary of Federation celebrations for so many of us in terms of the focus that there will be in the community. Of course it will be an election year, as we all appreciate. So while all these things will be important events, it will be a very busy year because it is an election year. </para><para>All my colleagues here would particularly want to acknowledge the support that we have received from our staff. We in the opposition have only a small staff, but we have a very effective staff. I want to say on behalf of my colleagues how much we have appreciated their efforts over the past year.

I do know that all my colleagues have had tremendous support from the staff that we have in this building and in our electorate offices.

A lot of them do an enormous amount of travel. They, like us, are away from their families for a considerable amount of time. I just want to acknowledge all the Democrats staff who work for us collectively or for individual senators.

I am assuming that with confidence and I commend the House for that wise decision. To include indexation in this particular bill is, in my view, unwise for the reasons that I outlined earlier. But, as we have some new blood in the Senate at this time of the night, I will run through them again.</para><para>This bill sets a charge which is really the inducement for the purchase of renewable energy, and it is important to get the charge at the right level. The opposition has argued that an indexation provision will keep the charge at the right level. We on this side have said that there is no real link between CPI increases and the charge level that is necessary to meet the objectives of the bill. Therefore a better course of action is to use the provision of the bill that requires that the bill be reconsidered after a period of years—and that provision has been included within the legislation. One of the specific charges of that inquiry process is, in fact, to look at the appropriate level of the charge. If it is found through that process that the charge, as it has been set at $40, is no longer sufficient to achieve the objectives of the bill, then we can assume that the government of the day will act to alter the charge. Obviously, it would do that because the government would have an interest in ensuring that the act worked effectively.</para><para>Therefore I submit to the Senate that to include indexation, whilst I understand the motive of the opposition in doing so, is not well founded and will not achieve the purpose which Senator Bolkus is seeking to achieve, and that the mechanism of the review and the consideration of all factors as to whether the charge is adequate for the time being is a better way to proceed. It is on that basis that I urge the Senate to agree to the amendment by the House of Representatives and to accept that the indexation is not appropriate for inclusion within this bill and should therefore be removed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>21242</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a pretty disappointing response from the minister and from the government. This is an important piece of legislation. It is one that the Senate has already recognised as being flawed in many respects. We have been successful in getting quite a number of amendments up this evening, but I think it would have been in the government's interests to have accepted the indexation measure, a measure which would have put some real ongoing value into the charge and, as a consequence, could have driven some of the industries that are really necessary under the government's objectives here. </para></talk.start><para>It does not leave us with an easy decision. There are different driving forces, different pressures—competing industry pressures, for instance. Senator Brown mentioned earlier our large renewable energy sector out there wanting to get going under this legislation. We have had representations from the Sustainable Energy Industry Association, from the Renewable Energy Generators Association, the Stanwell Corporation, a number of state governments, Pacific Hydro and Tasmanian Hydro—a whole range of industries keen to get this legislation in place. At the same time there are some pretty substantive environmental concerns, and we have been trying to address those during the course of the debate, although coming to this part of the debate we have to make a decision now as to what we do with our insistence on the amendment. As I say, the environmental concerns are essentially twofold. There are concerns about the protection of native forests from this measure and also the transparency of the government's legislation. </para><para>Let me weigh up where we are at the end of this debate. On the one hand, in terms of maintaining the value of the charge, we have been able to get the government to concede that the charge not be tax deductible. As a consequence, the measure is maintained to some degree in real value. On the other hand, having brought forward the review of the measure, what we are really arguing about here is something like $3 over the next couple of years: the index of the charge will increase it by about $3 over two years or by about $5 over three years. We were very keen to get the review brought forward by a year to ensure that we had some protection in case the government was not going to accept the indexation. The scrutiny provisions that we have picked up, drawing on the amendments moved by the Democrats, by the Greens and by us, essentially give us a much more transparent process, and that is not just to the benefit of the public interest but also in the interests of protecting the environment. Essentially, therefore, we have been quite successful in getting a whole batch of amendments up to ensure transparency and to ensure that the measure is enhanced in value—although not as enhanced as we would like. There are problems with the bill. There are problems as to whether it will achieve what it sets out to do. There are also problems as to ensuring that the environmental damage that people are concerned about will not flow from the passage of the legislation.</para><para>It is a hard decision to make, but at the end of this process it falls on the side of letting the legislation through. Given the balance of considerations and the balance of amendments that we have been able to wrangle out of the government, and given that the value has been maintained—particularly through the tax-deductible concession of the government—we are prepared to give the legislation a chance. We do not do it wholeheartedly, but we acknowledge that there is a driving force in the renewable energy sector that could benefit from this. However, we warn the government that there are a number of areas in the legislation that we will be monitoring closely with a view to redressing them when we win government in some 12 months time.</para><para>As I said, the index measure probably amounts to about $3 over two years. For that amount of money, it is probably not worth bowling over the legislation at this stage. Senator Hill, you have not done this in your best interests. You have probably been driven to do this by people like Senator Ferris, Senator Heffernan and Senator Minchin. But we will not stand in the way of this reform as a consequence, and I indicate that we will not be insisting on our amendments—though I do so without much enthusiasm. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>03:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>21243</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suppose we have won a few small improvements to the bill this evening, but the big one that the ALP have been delaying this bill for—CPI adjustment—has just been given away. I really wonder why a special amendment bill had to be introduced just a few hours ago and why the debate we had to have at that stage went ahead only to have the ALP cave in a few hours later. We really could have done all of this two months ago and had the measure up and running in January. </para></talk.start><para>I do not want to extend this debate any longer than is necessary, but I think it is essential to put a few points on the record. The <inline ref="R1085">Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000</inline> debate was unfinished business in more than one sense. The last time it was in the Senate was on 10 October. The debate then was not concluded for a number of reasons. Obviously, the ALP did not want the bill passed before COP6. I was very surprised when the ALP did their turnaround by, at the end of debate, declaring that they would insist on their CPI adjustment of the penalty after all, having not supported our efforts to remove native forests from the measure and a number of other amendments as well.</para><para>I did say on 10 October that we would do what so many players had asked, and that was to try to improve the bill—there were certainly plenty of ways that we could do that—and to make sure that it passed the Senate in the best form that the Senate could manage. Senator Bolkus's efforts to talk out the bill, so it would not come to the vote back then, were successful. To some degree I am grateful for the time that provided for us to regroup and to consult and talk with the people with the most at stake. Painful as Senator Bolkus's attacks on me and my colleagues were, I am grateful to have had that opportunity—although, at the end of the day, the outcome is hardly any different. We already had tax deductibility. Senator Bolkus is making much of that, but we already had that stitched up. We had most of the other amendments that finally got through this evening too.</para><para>As I have said many times in this debate, the Democrats were torn by the difficult position the government and the Labor Party had forced us into on this bill. On the one hand, the legislation offends against core Democrat territory because the bill has the potential to put so much more pressure on our native forests. The presence in the parliament of the forest industry in the last few weeks is testament—although I might say that they did not come and see me—to how important it is to them to have native forests included in this measure. On the other hand, it is critically important to give the renewable energy sector the start it needs to grow. As I said back in October, this bill could have been a small step on the way of weaning this country off dependence on fossil fuels for its energy needs. Senator Bolkus said in the previous debate that the reason he could not support native forest exclusion was that it would be likely to sink the bill. He said:</para><quote><para>We are saying that, despite some fundamental concerns we have in respect of it—</para></quote><para>that is, the bill—</para><quote><para>we think it should be passed, and we think that an amendment such as the one that Senator Brown moved will ensure that the legislation does not get through this place and the House of Representatives in time for it to be implemented and to have any impact at all.</para><para>It is basically a question of whether we want the legislation or whether we want to make an amendment to it at this stage. ... But we have already signalled a review of the legislation, and one of those close areas of scrutiny will be the way that native forests may be encompassed by the impact of the legislation. As I say, the judgment of the opposition is that the jury is out with respect to that, but we should approach this with a degree of scrutiny to ensure that the measure does not result in an increased biomass extraction in non-plantation forests.</para></quote><para>So two months ago Senator Bolkus wanted the legislation passed and then changed his mind, or apparently so. After indicating right throughout the debate on this bill that the ALP would not do anything to stop the passage of the bill, that they would not support most of the Democrats amendments, including taking out native forests, and therefore they would not insist on their amendments, Senator Bolkus did an about-face: yes, Labor would insist on CPI adjustment of the penalty after all and the Democrats could wear the odium of allowing this bill to pass with no restriction on native forests. We will not be party to supporting this bill, CPI adjustment or otherwise, as long as it includes native forests. I just wanted to make that clear. </para><para>I also need to defend myself, for the record, on a couple of cheap shots that Senator Bolkus took in my direction back then. He said I was dishonest in claiming that the amendment passed to ensure that the penalty for this measure was not tax deductible was a Democrat amendment. What he failed to mention at the time was the fact that Labor's amendment and mine were identical. Labor's appeared first on the running sheet, as is always the case in the hierarchy of this place, so it was put first. I suppose we could have put ours as well, but it hardly seemed sensible. This is petty stuff and hardly worth the time of the chamber.</para><para>Senator Bolkus also said I was gullible and cowardly. He said there was absolutely no imperative for me to fold within 12 hours of the legislation coming back from the House of Representatives. `Make them stew for a while; let them cogitate,' he said. Two months of letting the government stew does not seem to me to have achieved anything much at all, just a lot of time lost, and for what? It was for a three-month delay in the start-up of the measure. There will still be major incentives in the bill to cut down more of our native forests which, as I said, is of the greatest concern to us. It is bad news for forests and for other renewable energy sources. If we end up with biomass burners on the edge of every forest in this country producing cheap electricity, there will be little room in the market for wind or solar. </para><para>Having said that, the native forest issue is not yet dead. I hope the general public will be affronted, as we are, by the notion of burning biodiversity to produce electricity in this country. I hope they will demand of their electricity retailer that no energy is sourced this way. The Democrats will include this in their list of election campaign issues, along with schools, on which the two major parties have let the environment and the vast majority of Australians down. I hope this legislation does provide the necessary boost to solar and wind energy in this country. One of the recommendations in the global warming report suggests that Australia could capture five per cent of the global market for renewable energy by the year 2015. I think it will actually take much more renewable industry assistance to achieve that than this bill provides, but perhaps it will at least be a start.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 8) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>21245</page.no><id.no>R1168</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>21245</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives acquainting the Senate that the House has agreed to amendments Nos 2 to 7 made by the Senate, disagreed to amendment No. 1 and seeking the reconsideration of the amendment disagreed to.</para><para>Ordered that the message be considered in committee of the whole immediately.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>21245</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the committee does not insist on the amendment disagreed to by the House of Representatives.</para></motion><para>The government will not be supporting the Democrat and Labor sponsored amendment to this bill.

That is the issue we are dealing with here. This afternoon we considered the 1,665th amendment to the GST roll-back, and the government cannot find it in its heart at this time of year to exempt the GST from personal aquatic survival skills—swimming lessons. This is a minister who wants to impose a GST on swimming lessons offered by the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia just prior to the Christmas-New Year break. This is a particularly unfortunate episode and it highlights the mean spiritedness of this minister and of this government at this time of year. </para></talk.start><para>We have not received a satisfactory explanation from the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about the apparent disagreement between the Australian Democrats and the government in respect of the deal that they signed earlier this year when they agreed to pass the GST. On the one hand, Senator Kemp said that this particular area, swimming lessons—which impacts on hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly young Australians—would be excluded from the GST. On the other hand, the Democrats have argued that it was part of that deal. Who are we to believe? Senator Kemp or Senator Murray? I know it is a bit difficult. It was a hard call. But, in the end, we decided on the basis of fairness and equity that you should not be applying a GST to hundreds of thousands of young people in this country who are undertaking swimming lessons offered by the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia. Here is the minister attempting to blackmail the Senate and the parliament by arguing that he is going to abandon the 60-odd roll-back GST amendments in this bill that are so important to small business, that they claim were unnecessary but we now have to consider on the basis that they want to put a GST on swimming lessons—swimming lessons. The minister should be ashamed of himself.</para><para>The other justification the minister gave for imposing a GST on swimming lessons this afternoon was to assure the Australian public that everyone has tax cuts and increases in allowances. I would wish him well on the beaches of Australia this summer explaining to people in trouble that they should be rescued by tax cuts and increases in allowances. This is an appalling performance by this government. It typifies their approach on the GST, and the Labor Party will not be accepting the concept of a GST on swimming lessons. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>21246</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I make it very clear for the benefit of the Assistant Treasurer that this is not in any way a move away from our agreement; it is simply a clarification of what was originally intended. The original amendments were drawn up with the Royal Life Saving Society and the Surf Life Saving Society with advice from Treasury. It was not until after the legislation passed that we had a new ruling from Treasury that drew the line at where lifesaving courses became GST free—five or six levels up from what are your basic survival skills at the level of where you start saving someone else. I think it is quite extraordinary, as one who used to be an instructor and examiner with the Royal Life Saving Society, to suggest that you cannot know something about saving yourself—and it does not seem to be of any great interest to the government; you tax all of that—but once you actually jump in the water, presuming you know when, because all of the previous courses seem to be of minor consideration, all of a sudden it is something that the government considers worth learning.  </para></talk.start><para>I say to the government that this is not exempting—and I will just read it in case the minister has forgotten—swimming lessons per se. We are not talking about people who go to their local coach, wanting to perfect their backstroke style or swim like Michael Klim in the butterfly or whatever. These are—and I read—including `personal aquatic survival skills'. If the minister has not looked at the manuals recently of the Royal Life Saving Society or the Surf Life Saving Society, they include things like when to go in the water and when not to go in the water—or rather how you actually do go in the water. It is more than just saving lives; it will also save a lot of spinal injuries if people actually know how to enter the water.</para><para>Given the hour, I will not go through a full list of the various survival skills that a person needs, but I will say that the first few courses and the first few certificates simply assist people to know the basics of how to look after themselves. I think it is quite extraordinary that this government is such a penny-pinching mob. Considering the amount of revenue we seem to have raised and the size of the surplus, we can suddenly find $23 billion for defence, but we cannot think of basic survival courses for kids who need to be able to look after themselves. Considering the number of Australians who are going to be spending time at the beach or the local creek this summer, it should be a priority for government to actively encourage them into courses that teach them something about how to look after themselves.</para><para>What I really do find offensive about this message that has come back is this bit on the end about `delay will not be of the government's doing'. I assure you, Senator, that delay will be of your doing, because we are going to insist on what is quite a simple measure and what is a clarification of an undertaking and a clarification of the earlier amendments that were changed by later rulings—and that was nothing we did or implied.

Firstly, whilst I appreciate the power of Senator Sherry's address, the actual phrase is `including personal aquatic survival skills'. It does not say `including swimming lessons'. The government has said that this amendment has a scope so wide that it is going to put the entire GST base at risk.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, the government have said—it is just ludicrous, isn't it?—that this affects their Commonwealth-states agreement. I would make the point to the Senate, which Labor senators might not be aware of, that Senator Lees wrote to the Prime Minister some considerable time back. If the Commonwealth had really wanted to get busy with this and had their hearts in it, they have had plenty of time to talk to the states about it. So this is not a sudden thing that has emerged. This idea that you have not had the time to consult the states, as is implied here, is wrong.</para><para>Thirdly, I want to mention this quite ridiculous statement: `any delay will not be of the government's doing'. Senator Faulkner, you have a peculiar sense of humour sometimes. I want to imagine the government going out to small business and saying, `Small business, the reason you haven't got this bill in time is that we wouldn't accept "including personal aquatic survival skills".' How absolutely pathetic! Imagine that: the government are going to knock on the door of the hardware store and say, `Sorry you couldn't get your amendment. It's because we wouldn't accept a Democrat amendment, which was supported by Labor, which said "including personal aquatic survival skills".'

Prior to entering politics, Kate studied pharmacy at the Queensland University, married and had two children, as well as owning pharmacies. As if this was not enough, she helped lobby for a Pharmacy Guild for the ACT, and became its inaugural president. It was through the world of pharmacy that I first got to know Kate. My own wife's involvement in pharmacy brought Kate and me together, along with some other interstate pharmacists who were concerned about pending pharmacy legislative changes.</para></talk.start><para>Kate joined the National Council of the Pharmacy Guild—the second woman ever to do so—and then was approached to stand for the ACT Legislative Assembly. In fact, in her own words, `Politics was something I never planned to do; it happened while I was doing something else.' She entered the Assembly as a 37-year-old pharmacist with little party experience but loads of energy. She became ACT Chief Minister in 1995, after a mere three years in politics and has been responsible for a wide range of portfolios. Of the three Chief Ministers who have served in the ACT, Kate has served the longest. In fact, she is the longest-serving female leader that Australian has known.</para><para>Throughout the time she has been in the ACT parliament, she has shown great leadership qualities. In fact, her leadership has been inspirational. She has been keen to cut red tape. It is not surprising her leadership style did not win her universal admiration. In fact, this has meant that on some occasions she has been less than popular. At times, she was met with strong opposition. But her grasp of the various issues that confronted her and her determination to resolve them have been of the utmost value during her career in politics. There is no denying that under the Carnell government the region's fortunes were turned around and today Canberra does not rely on the presence of government as much as it did when Kate came into office.</para><para>Kate has used her keen negotiating skills throughout her political career. It is in this sort of role that her leadership qualities have stood out. She has never lost sight of the fact that the territory is not totally dependent on the presence of parliament—now 54 per cent of the work force in the ACT is in the private sector. It is little wonder that the local business community adored her. She has been a constant saleswoman for the region, rarely missing an opportunity to sell Canberra as a venue to visit, to do business and to host events. Her personal vote in the last election was far higher than any of her Assembly colleagues. Her popularity remained intact, despite political obstacles—many of which were beyond her or her government's control. It is unfortunate that this real achiever has suffered at the hands of those of lesser qualities and some who have been jealous of her high level of achievement. Australia, and particularly Canberra, is very much the poorer for this.</para><para>Canberra is not losing Kate, as she is moving to a new phase of life where she will take up a position with local government broadband carrier, TransACT. So the territory retains one of its greatest advocates. Kate is a person who has set high standards in the ACT parliament, and she has set a fine example to other women with her balanced approach to career and to family. She is an inspiration for women thinking of entering the political arena. As a figurehead, you cannot go past Kate Carnell.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>21249</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I rise this morning to make a short speech highlighting the contribution made to the peace process in East Timor by some particularly brave and courageous constituents in my electorate of Queensland. I am referring to the men and women in our armed forces from the Enoggera based 6th Royal Australian Regiment and the Townsville based 1st Royal Australian Regiment, RAR. I am sure we have all followed with interest, pride and a degree of anxiety the often hazardous situations our servicemen and women find themselves in. East Timor, particularly on the border areas with West Timor, remains a very dangerous and life-threatening place for our peacekeepers. We have been reminded of that fact recently when an Australian peacekeeper from Toowoomba was shot at and wounded by the Indonesian militia near the town of Balibo. Thankfully his injuries, I believe, are not life-threatening. However, it serves to highlight the level of danger our soldiers are facing.</para></talk.start><para>Tragically, one Australian soldier, Corporal Stuart Jones of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, paid the ultimate price for service to his country, as did a New Zealand infantryman, Private Leonard Manning, and a Nepalese peacekeeper. Corporal Jones, or `Monster' as he was called by his mates, had not been in East Timor for long when a rifle discharged accidentally, mortally wounding him. I am sure that all of my colleagues in this place will join with me today in extending our deepest sympathies to all of the families and friends of these brave young people.</para><para>Dispute these sacrifices and the fact that there are still nearly 2,000 Australian diggers still serving in this perilous environment, the general public rarely read any media reports concerning their efforts, now the initial offensive is complete. Their heroism and valour should not be ignored or forgotten by the Australian community, particularly during Christmas celebrations, when many families will be painfully aware of their loved one's absence. It will no doubt be an emotionally tough and lonely time for many families of diggers serving in East Timor, and they deserve our thoughts and wishes for their safety.</para><para>The 6th RAR returned from East Timor approximately six weeks ago, after spending six months on the volatile border area, including the villages of Suai, Batugarde, Tonabibi, Maliana and Balibo. They had numerous military exercises to execute, but they also performed a variety of humanitarian roles during their tour. Overseeing and providing manpower for the reconstruction of some of the countless buildings looted and destroyed by the pro-Indonesian militia was just one of the many tasks undertaken to directly assist the East Timorese people to rebuild their communities and their lives. The rebuilding of churches, bridges, schools and hospitals was an essential aspect of our troops' efforts to establish an infrastructure that will assist the East Timorese people to regain some normality in their lives and move forward. The re-establishment of an accessible road network was also vitally important to facilitate trade between villages, provide greater social interaction and improve living standards. </para><para>The 6th RAR were also instrumental in providing assistance to build a facility that the National Council of Timorese Resistance could operate from. The National Council of Timorese Resistance was established by the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor. Its 36 members will serve as East Timor's de facto parliament until national elections scheduled in August 2001. It represents a broad cross-section of society and debates legislation proposed by the eight-person transitional cabinet. The national council is the first transitional step for the East Timorese people in establishing a democratically elected government.</para><para>I visited East Timor with members of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in December 1999. We visited Dili and Suai and, of course, the place was in total devastation. One of the things that struck me most was the obvious fondness the people showed towards the Australian soldiers. I plan to revisit East Timor in February and it will be interesting to see the changes and progress that have been made.</para><para>Whilst acknowledging the gutsy contribution all of our serving diggers have made, I would briefly like to mention some of them by name. Private Simon Nilon, Private Anthony Schofield, Private Brett Lewis, Private Chad Bryan, Lance Corporal Ryan Hummell, Lance Corporal Andrew Paisley, Platoon Commander Lieutenant Andrew George, Sergeant George Marshall, Major David Thomae and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Moon are just some of the men from the Enoggera based 6th RAR who are particularly pleased to be home with their families for the Christmas break. I think I speak on behalf of all senators from both sides of this chamber when I welcome back our troops from 6th RAR and wish the troops from 1st RAR a safe and speedy return.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>21250</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—As the Senate is aware, a notable event occurred in Melbourne last Sunday, 3 December. There was a reconciliation walk across Princes Bridge organised by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation as one of its last major undertakings. The walk drew about between 200,000 and 300,000 participants. In the words of Dr Evelyn Scott, Chair of the Reconciliation Council, it gave a clear demonstration of the national mood for reconciliation. Indeed, as Senator Herron said at question time today, reconciliation is now an unstoppable force in the nation. The challenge we as a nation now face is how to direct this force as a force for unity rather than a force for division.</para></talk.start><para>What we witnessed at the Melbourne reconciliation walk and earlier walks that took place in other capital cities was a clear demonstration that indigenous Australians collectively have now won the respect of their fellow citizens as equals. The next step is for indigenous Australians as individuals to win the respect of their fellows. That will be a harder task because, as individuals, our ability to command respect is inevitably judged on our ability as individuals to stand comparison with others, and it is hard to compare well when one's health is poor, one's education is lacking, one is denied employment opportunities and employment choices by circumstances if not necessarily by design, and one's home is often no better than a hovel.</para><para>The need for practical reconciliation is recognised by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. In its final report presented to the Prime Minister this morning, the council's concluding remarks note that:</para><quote><para>Reconciliation requires overcoming differences in social and economic outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians.</para></quote><para>Since 1996 the Howard government has directed indigenous affairs along just such a course of practical reconciliation with success, achieving notable improvements in indigenous health, education, employment and housing. I have some statistics here; however, these are statistics which Senator Herron raised in question time in the Senate, and so perhaps I might skip them. However, we can confidently expect this part of the reconciliation process to remain steadily on course. </para><para>Let me refer to another aspect of the Melbourne reconciliation walk. I was not able to participate in the walk personally because that morning I had a prior commitment with the Cambodian Australian community of Victoria, who were celebrating the opening of the Cambodian Heritage House located in Springvale, a south-eastern suburb of metropolitan Melbourne. By the time I made my way to central Melbourne, the walk was over, although I did briefly join the many people still congregated in the Domain. I made an effort to get to the site of the walk as a gesture by an Australian of non-English speaking background—we account for more than one-quarter of our nation's citizens—to show our fellows that we are aware of the reality that indigenous Australians have suffered injustices historically. While we cannot be said to have played any part in the creation of these injustices, we do share with all Australians a sense of deep and sincere regret that such injustices have happened. Although we had no part in the wrongs of the past, we do share the hope that henceforth all Australians will move forward together as a people in unity.</para><para>I was of course not unique in my desire to demonstrate this commitment to our fellows. Amongst the crowd that remained on the domain when I arrived and amongst the streams of people moving away from that gathering place were people of many diverse appearances, people of all ages, people of all races, people of all statuses—a typical Australian crowd. What was remarkable about this crowd and the crowds at the other reconciliation walk was not only its diversity but its spontaneity. There was no compulsion on anyone to walk. This highlights the most important ingredient of true reconciliation: the spontaneity, the absence of compulsion.</para><para>By a coincidence, the reason I was not able to join the walk at its beginning, being the celebration of the opening of the Cambodian Heritage House, brings into sharp relief the way competing priorities could influence individual's actions in a society in which one's actions are not by compulsion. We had a celebration on that day of the first peoples of this land and a celebration of one of the newest peoples of this land; a juxtaposition that heightens the richness of our society, a thing in itself worthy of celebration. However, I might well have been criticised for choosing one event over another, as indeed I was so criticised on a previous occasion. We should accept that, when there is an absence of compulsion, a preference of one event over another does not mean denigration of one over the other, but merely the consequence of meeting the need to accommodate competing priorities.</para><para>I wish to close my remarks on this note: that true reconciliation cannot be achieved through compulsion, though the temptation to do so must be great. With the best intentions when the task is hard, when the task is known to be hard, when there seems to be so little time, when the desire to see some quick returns becomes overwhelmingly strong, it is tempting to think that if only an order can be applied, a rule written down, then all would be well. It would not be. A free people cannot be ordered what to think. However, the order may appear to be moral rectitude.</para><para>For all the wise observations that are to be found throughout the final report, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation seems to have fallen at the last hurdle of such a temptation. While the body of the report abounds with observations about the spontaneous and natural manner in which Australians of all backgrounds have embraced the reconciliation process, in the six recommendations that close the final report, the council falls back to the device of recommending the establishment of a regime of governmental, legislative and constitutional rules to compel Australians to reconcile with one another. That may be a good intention but the value of the report is thus diminished. With that, unfortunately, I think the place of the council in history is also diminished. Reconciliation is a two-way journey taken by and between free peoples. It should always be thought of in this way. This way the nation can truly go forward. I recommend that the council revisit these proposals. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>21252</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier this evening a number of senators spoke on the matter of wishing well our colleagues who serve us in this place, and I should also like to make some remarks in that regard. It struck me at the time that, if the 76 of us arrived here one morning and there were nobody in the building to help run the parliament, we would be a sorry lot indeed. I do not think we would get very far. That alone, I think, serves to remind us of the way we are well served by the Department of the Senate, the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and, of course, the Joint House Department. Perhaps we do not see so much of them but, in fact, the work that they do to assist us in running and operating is very significant indeed. To all those in the departments, I wish them well at this time of year as they join their families for Christmas and New Year and perhaps have holidays. I certainly trust that, if they are driving, they drive safely on the roads and come back to us again next year. Without going into the list of all those involved, all those I am referring to are within those departments of the parliament—their service is greatly valued indeed.</para></talk.start><para>I particularly mention those in attendance in the chamber, who have had a busy year and a particularly busy week. We owe a great debt to you indeed for your quiet, efficient way of looking after the chamber and seeing that our needs are met. You are indeed appreciated. We certainly understand the pressure that you have been under during this week. To have had two nights as late as Monday night and tonight is extremely difficult for all concerned.</para><para>One other matter I wish to mention before I sit down is that Senator Lees is to marry on 23 December. I certainly wish her well as she embarks on this course. I am sure all of you, my colleagues, join with me in wishing her well for the event, the wedding on 23 December, and for her future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>04:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>21252</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I will now give the speech I would have given on the adjournment.

Let me start off with a quote from Sir Rupert Hamer, a great Australian. He contributed to a book called <inline font-style="italic">Save our ABC: The Case for Maintaining Australia's National Broadcaster</inline>, which was published in 1996. He starts off his contribution to this book with a quote from Ken Inglis's history of the ABC:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>As the bells in the tower of Sydney's General Post Office chimed 8 o'clock on the evening of Friday 1 July 1932, the peals were picked up and carried to every state of the federation. `This is the Australian Broadcasting Commission,' said the announcer, Conrad Charlton. Then he introduced the Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, to pronounce the Commission inaugurated.</para></quote><para>He goes on to talk about the ABC and how it has fulfilled its statutory obligations. In 1996, what did the ABC provide? I think it still provides this and more. In 1996 it provided:</para><quote><para>six Australia-wide radio networks</para><para>nine metropolitan radio stations</para><para>forty-nine regional radio stations</para><para>Radio National, a specialist spoken word network—</para></quote><para>we all know what has happened to Radio National—</para><quote><para>ABC Classic FM</para><para>a parliamentary and news network on radio</para><para>a national television service</para><para>Radio Australia, an international service—</para></quote><para>even sadder—</para><quote><para>Australia Television, an international satellite service—</para></quote><para>extremely sad—</para><quote><para>six symphony orchestras</para><para>twenty-four ABC Shops &amp; over 110 ABC Centres</para><para>an on-line Internet service</para></quote><para>Then he goes on to give a lovely quote—I love this quote of Sir Rupert Hamer's. He quotes from the Liberal and National parties' policy document for the 1996 election, <inline font-style="italic">Better Communications</inline>—one of my favourite reads: </para><quote><para>This vast network provides a diverse range of programs and performances of cultural value and intellectual integrity. The ABC has a proud record of offering high quality and diverse programming across a broad spectrum of human interests including news, current affairs, drama, sport and the arts.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say a lot more about what the Liberal and National parties would do in 1996—that is, what they said they would do in 1996 if they got into government, what they promised the Australian public they would do for the ABC if they ever got into government. The great tragedy for the ABC is that people believed them. Australians believed the coalition in 1996 when they talked about what they would do for the ABC, and it really was a great tragedy for Australia. Further on in this book, there is a piece by Robyn Williams of the science unit of the ABC—perhaps I should say the former science unit of the ABC. As we know, the ABC science unit has been disbanded. He says:</para><quote><para>Our own ABC Science Unit was set up in 1964. The foundation director of science programs for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was a young chemistry schoolmaster called Peter Pockley.</para></quote><para>He talks about the science unit and its importance to Australia and he talks about how science is very popular all around the world—not just in Australia. He says:</para><quote><para>Books by Paul Davies, David Attenborough, Richard Dawkins and Karl Kruselnicki sell by the truckload.</para></quote><para>People love to know about science. They love to know what is going on in the sciences. One of the reasons for that, of course, is the ABC science unit. It is one of the few places in Australia where Australians can hear in an interesting and friendly way what is going on in science, and they do get interested in it. They go out and buy the books, and they want to know about physics, chemistry and biology. They want to know about science. Unfortunately now, of course, the ABC science unit has been disbanded.</para><para>Further on, Mr Williams says:</para><quote><para>There are few times in the life of a nation when a whole institution, a major part of its culture, could disappear forever.</para><para>That time has been reached. I am sure that an ABC will live on in some benign form, providing basic services of news, current affairs and river heights. I have profound doubts about the rest of our services and traditions. Many of them look as wobbly as a mad cow, some are already on their knees.</para></quote><para>At the end of his piece, he says:</para><quote><para>... the first casualties of penury will be the specialist programs, notably science, and once gone they will take a generation to get back.</para></quote><para>Well, yes, that is true. The first casualty has been science.</para><para>What of the other specialist units? What of religion, what of the arts, what of media, what of all those other specialist units? They are going to go next. I am sure religion will go after science. We do not have any interesting, friendly commentary about religion anywhere else in Australia, and we will not have it once that specialist unit is gone, and it looks to me as if that specialist unit is going to go next. This morning the Senate passed a motion of concern about the ABC. The majority of senators are very concerned about what is going on in the ABC. The thing they are most concerned about, of course, is the budgetary appropriation to the ABC, which is so vastly and appallingly inadequate.</para><para>Earlier this week we had an announcement of an extra $23 billion over 10 years for defence funding. Previous to that we had heard that the government could not find any extra money for anything, particularly for the ABC, and then they found $23 billion. Good on them. The Defence Force could use some more money—that is excellent. But, with only 6½ per cent of that money that the government found for defence, you could bring the funding of the ABC back up to what it was before even the ALP government started to cut it. You could bring it up to what it was under Malcolm Fraser—the glory days of the ABC. With only 6½ per cent of what defence is getting, you could have the funding of the ABC back to where it ought to be. It is not very much at all. If the government can find $23 billion over 10 years to increase Defence Force funding, surely they can find 6½ per cent more to put into something which is absolutely necessary to Australia, and that is the ABC, the public broadcaster. </para><para>Minister Alston answered a question from me—I think it was earlier this week, or it could have been last week; it is a bit late and my brain is not exactly what it ought to be, I am afraid—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—You are doing all right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator McGauran; my friend Senator McGauran, unlike some in this chamber. In the answer to that question, he first of all mentioned that he had not noticed a copy of my private member's bill on the ABC board. I do not know how it slipped past him. I actually sent him a copy, but perhaps he does not read everything that comes across his desk—fair enough, he is a minister. But I sent him a copy of my private member's bill on the ABC board and how it should be appointed. He did say that he would read it. I hope he does because in fact my private member's bill was a reflection of Senator Alston's own recommendation in the ABC report of March 1995. That recommendation was that there should be a joint parliamentary committee to look into all appointments to the ABC board. In March 1995, a majority of the Senate—at that point it was the Democrats, the Liberals and the Nationals—was concerned that there were some political appointments to the ABC board. I must say that I am even far more concerned now. The primary desire of people on the ABC board should be to see the ABC grow and prosper, but I do not think that is what everybody who is being put on this ABC board want. I hope it is, but I think it has been shown from many things that we have heard that there is at least one person on that board who does not want that. I think that is another tragedy. I think the ABC is full of tragedies at the moment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are several other recommendations that Senator Alston made in this excellent report, <inline font-style="italic">Our ABC</inline>, the report of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, March 1995. Unfortunately, it appears to me that he has completely reversed on them; he has gone in the completely opposite direction to what he recommended. I know honourable senators just cannot believe that Senator Alston would do the complete opposite of what he recommended in 1995 once he got into the ministry—I know that senators will find that absolutely astounding. I find it astounding. I find it shocking, and I am sure that Senator Alston would also find it shocking. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> I thank the Senate for granting an extension of time. I am very grateful for the Senate's indulgence, in particular from those senators who do not particularly like what I am saying. I recommended to Senator Alston that he go back and have a look at this excellent committee and its excellent recommendations. I should perhaps mention, although it is a little inglorious of me, that I was the deputy chair of the committee—but, of course, I was only the deputy chair to Senator Alston's excellent chairing of the committee. One of the recommendations says:</para><quote><para>No changes to the existing structure of TV news and current affairs should be made without full consultation with staff, the obtaining of detailed research information, and comprehensive consideration by the board of all relevant issues.</para></quote><para>I understand that that is something that is up to the board, but I would have thought that Senator Alston would have made it very clear to the board that this is something that the Senate, at least in 1995, thought was a really excellent idea. It is very sensible not to change that sort of thing. However, the area of news and current affairs is being changed and it is being changed quite drastically, and we are all aware that it is being changed quite drastically. Recommendation 16 is a really central recommendation:</para><quote><para>... where the Parliament requires the ABC to undertake new Charter activities or to expand existing Charter activities, it should provide funds sufficient to ensure that existing activities are not adversely affected.</para></quote><para>That certainly has not happened—in fact, the opposite has happened. I keep thinking of the word `tragedy'. I am trying to think of another one, but it is pretty well the most adequate word to describe what is happening to the ABC at the moment. I am not the only person who thinks that; I have had hundreds and hundreds of emails over the last couple of days—and before that I had hundreds of emails on the disbanding of the science unit—since the strike of ABC staff. It was the first one we have seen of this magnitude in 10 years. In fact, I may be wrong but I think that even in that last one 10 years ago some of the management were still working, but in this strike I think that even management was not working. I tried to turn on ABC Television news on the night of the strike, and instead of the news there was an excellent program on the river red gum. I had hopes that it was from the ABC science unit but unfortunately not; it was from the natural history unit. But it was still an excellent program, and it was still about Australia. Of course, that is one of the things that we will not be getting if we do not have an adequately funded ABC. </para><para>So there was no television news, there was no <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, there was no current affairs. Tim Fischer was stopped at the door on his way into the House of Representatives the next morning and somebody said to him, `Would you like to comment on anything?' And he said, `No, I can't comment on anything because I couldn't hear any news this morning—I turned on the radio and there was no news.' Like Mr Fischer, I always turn on ABC Radio in the morning to hear the news, to hear the current affairs, to hear <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, to find out what is going on in the world outside parliament. I know that Mr Fischer is a great fan of the ABC—we have discussed it many times—and so am I. It was very disorienting not to have the ABC news that morning and not to know what was going on outside Parliament House—which, after all, is a pretty closed environment.</para><para>That is the sort of thing that we can all try to get used to because more and more parts of the ABC are just going to disappear because the funding is so vastly inadequate. Of course, it is not just the funding that is inadequate. It is very difficult with such inadequate funding to actually do the right thing by the staff, and the staff are feeling very unloved at the moment. It must be very difficult to do that job when there is such a difficult atmosphere. The atmosphere is obviously very difficult within the ABC, and that should be of concern to every single Australian. In fact, it is of concern to the vast majority of Australians. If the government does not understand that, it is doing itself a terrible disservice, because at the next election people will know what the government actually did, what its actions were; they will not believe what it says. They will know what they have seen it do, and the government is in big trouble if that is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>21255</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I listened with interest to Senator Bourne's comments about the ABC. Nobody in regional Australia could possibly disagree about the importance of the role that the ABC play. I wish to make the point that the ABC get a very large amount of money, and the government takes the view that they should manage, and manage they will. It is not a debate about the value of the ABC: I think we all value it. But I do particularly make the point about regional radio, which is important to us, that there can be no cost cutting there. If you ring the radio people, the person answering the phone is generally the person on air and is also the person who is making the coffee. They are particularly hard working and they do a particularly good job for all of us who live outside the metropolitan areas.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to make some comments about the defence white paper which was released the day before yesterday. It is a most timely strategic review. It has been described as the most important strategic review of Australia's defence in 20 years. It is timely for all sorts of reasons, particularly in light of what Senator Gibbs said in terms of our continuing commitment in East Timor. Our commitment there is just over a year old. I think the decision was taken in September last year that we go in; it looked like we were going in around September and I think the troops left just on a year ago. It is not just about East Timor: we have an arch of instability that surrounds Australia, both to the north and east, in the Indonesian archipelago and West Irian, in Papua and West Papua, in the Solomons and in Fiji. For many years Australians have focused on this matter more than on other terms of their defence requirements. </para><para>There is a greater interest in defence issues now than there has been for many years. There are a number of reasons for this. There is a distance from the antiwar movement of the 1970s. Grandfathers are keener to talk about defence issues with their grandchildren than they were with their children, when the war was too close and too painful for them. There is the fact that, to their credit, the previous government had in 1995 <inline font-style="italic">Australia Remembers</inline>, which highlighted the 50 years since the end of the Second World War. I think Australians appreciated that. There is the very keen interest that young Australians especially have in Gallipoli, and the fact that greater numbers of young Australians are going to Gallipoli each year. There is the fact that what was Armistice Day, when I was young, is now Remembrance Day. That day nearly went out of fashion in the 1970s because of the very painful divisions in the Australian community over Vietnam, and I think that time has healed those wounds.</para><para>All Australians are immensely proud of the role that we took in East Timor, which we took for all sorts of reasons which are perhaps divisive and political. I will not discuss those tonight, but what we did was morally correct. We went in to help people who needed help, as Australians have always done. We have never been warmongers. We have never gone out to impose our will on people. Earlier this week when I was at the Australian War Memorial with students from Farrer High School in Tamworth, which is my local city where I have my office, I made the point to the boys who were there that 102,000 Australians have been killed in wars this century. When you remember the number of people who filled Stadium Australia—Stadium Australia takes 140,000—you realise that 102,000 is an awful lot of people. They did it not to impose their will or our will on other people but to do the right thing. They were making a contribution to world peace, and they did it very successfully.</para><para>For all those reasons, I think there is an increasing interest in defence issues. So it was very timely that we had the defence white paper. I make the point that the defence white paper came out not only after this continuing and increasing interest in defence but also after the work of the community consultative committee headed by former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrew Peacock, assisted by General Clunies-Ross and two former members of this place—Senator Stephen Loosley and Senator David MacGibbon. They held committee hearings right around the country, and these were well attended. I make the point that it is one thing to say that we need to spend more money on defence but it is another thing to have community ownership of that debate. That is essential. The consultative committee certainly played its part in doing that, and it is important that it did. I commend all the members of that committee. I think they did an admirable and important job.</para><para>We have had a respectable increase in the amount of money that will be spent on defence over the next 10 years. A figure of $23 billion has been cited, which takes us to $140 billion to defend Australia over the next 10 years. Like the management of the ABC, the management and senior officers of Defence have been told that they have a large amount of money which it is up to them to manage, and manage they will. They will manage in exactly in the same way as the ABC. I would give them the same advice, Senator Bourne. We have given the ABC a budget, we have given them a charter and we have asked them to manage, and manage they will. Particularly for the Navy, we have had a commitment to make the Collins class submarine and its warfare system ready for war. Its combat system needs continuing effort to make it so. There is also a commitment to upgrade the Anzac class frigates. The final couple will come online shortly. We have a commitment to upgrade and replace the Fremantle class patrol boats. When you consider that Australia has eight million square kilometres of ocean in its exclusive economic zone, we have to make a very large commitment to that. </para><para>I made the point the week before last in New Zealand, where I had been asked to make some comments on integration between the New Zealand and Australian military, that, whereas New Zealand has, surprisingly, half the exclusive economic zone that Australia has, its effort in policing that is almost negligible. It has four inshore patrol boats and it has five ageing maritime patrol Orion aircraft. While Australia might be criticised for not doing enough with our exclusive economic zone, we in fact put up 19 Orion aircraft, about 18 Bombardier DASH-8 type aircraft and two helicopters. We put out 15 Fremantle patrol boats, a couple of deep sea fishing boats and seven or eight Customs boats. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> So we do make for our exclusive economic zone a very considerable effort. Some people might argue that it is perhaps not enough and that we should do more but, when we compare ourselves with our New Zealand friends across the Tasman, we make a very considerable effort.</para><para>The next area of expenditure to which the white paper directs itself is the Army. There is a determination to increase the numbers of the ADF, and most of those will be in the Army. The figure goes from 51,000 to 54,000, increasing the number of battalions that have a degree of readiness from four to six. I think this was highlighted specifically in our East Timor response. So the extra 3,000 service men and women will basically be in those battalions which are available for some degree of action and readiness immediately. Also, the Army will be getting new attack helicopters. The degree of weaponry on those armed helicopters is as yet unknown, but it is important. There are some heavy lift helicopters too.</para><para>The Air Force—this also refers to our capacity to oversee our exclusive economic zone—will be getting AWACS aircraft, which are essential for surveillance and also for the management of strike aircraft and fighter aircraft these days. There are upgrades to the FA18s and a commitment to new aircraft to replace the FA18s and the F111s towards the middle of the second decade of the new century.</para><para>Finally, I make some brief comments on the reserves, which have always been very important to this country. They are important to regional Australia because they are very often based in regional Australia. There is a commitment in the white paper that deals with the call-out capacity for the reserves in times that are less than a national call-out; that is, the capacity to call them out for flood, fire and national emergencies. Pretty clearly the reserves want that. In fact, they are used in these sorts of situations already. We, as a government, and all governments would see that a proper legislative program of arrangements is essential for that to happen. Mr Deputy President Hogg, when you were chair of the inquiry into the military's assistance to the civil authorities, you would have seen that it is important that the legislative program is put in place to make sure that people understand exactly what is expected of them. This legislative program will include a recognition by the government that the reservists must be able to leave their workplace, their employer must be happy and their conditions of employment must be maintained and protected. These things will be addressed, and they have been highlighted in the white paper.</para><para>I think the East Timor deployment has specially highlighted the need for reservists, not only specialist reservists like doctors, nurses and people like that but very often the nuts and bolts people who keep the show on the road: the carpenters, the plumbers and people able to get tankers driven off the beach. These sorts of people were essential and they are not in the critical mass of regular service men and women. The role that they played in East Timor was very important in that regard.</para><para>The other important point that the white paper makes is that you cannot be all things to all people, and it might be appropriate that the role of the reservist is that of a specialist, in terms of a specialist job in response to a crisis. I think that is important. I also think the suggestion that various Defence reserve units be held in differing degrees of readiness is appropriate. I do not think any of us would be dissatisfied with the commitment to cadets that has also been highlighted in the white paper. There is a $30 million commitment to the 417 units across the country, many of which are in regional Australia. There are 25,000 cadets already, but not in the integrated way that I think most Australians would think is worth while. There is a commitment there to make their training regime competent and national. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>21258</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I do not think I have ever made a speech at this time of the day in the 13 years I have been a senator—I have only just woken up in fact—but I wanted to put on the record that, as the Government Whip, I appreciate the cooperation that I have had from the opposition whips and their staff this year. It has been a particularly difficult year, with a lot of legislation going through this place. In any event, things do not happen unless you have the cooperation of the other side, and I would like to put that on the record.</para></talk.start><para>In February next year, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee will be conducting an inquiry into the proposed importation of apples and pears from New Zealand, which has become quite a hot issue. Without canvassing all the issues, I must put on the record that it is going to be a very important inquiry as far as one of the major industries in Australia and my home state is concerned. As Senator O'Brien would know, after many years of neglect, those in the apple industry are starting to find their feet again. They are doing that by changing their orchards from the old varieties to the new varieties that are more akin to market demands, particularly in Japan and Taiwan. In Tasmania we have developed fuji apples, a variety which is much sought after. It is pleasing to see that the Huon Valley has revived itself, not just through the salmon industry but also through the changes to the apple industry. </para><para>So I look forward to February 2001 when the committee will, I understand, traverse Australia and take evidence from all the apple and pear growing states, and with some luck we might even go to New Zealand. It is going to be a very controversial subject, and I just hope that the Senate can do what it did with the salmon inquiry—that is, show the people of Australia that the bureaucracy does not run the situation and that the Senate plays a very important role, and provide the people of Australia with the opportunity to put their point of view. In the case of the fruit industry, it is very important that the industry itself has the opportunity to put forward its views because the biggest criticism of this inquiry has been that the industry has not had the consultation with AQIS, Biosecurity and the powers that be that it should have had. This is an ongoing problem. I just hope that next year people take the opportunity to put their points of view to Senator O'Brien and me—I do not know whether Senator Murphy will be going—and listen to what other fruit growers have to say. The fact that Shepparton closed its doors and people marched through the streets shows that it is a very hot issue around rural areas of Australia. </para><para>I am particularly pleased that we in the Senate have taken the lead in referring this matter to a committee—a committee of which I am no longer a member. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee was originally called the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I think I am pretty right in saying that when former Senator Brownhill and the Democrats joined forces to control the debate in the previous government we were able to create a committee that did not exist before. I think the last time the primary industry department was reflected in the Senate was in 1940. So we were able to create a new committee—the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee—and it has become probably the hardest working committee in the Senate. </para><para>This committee has had to tackle particularly difficult issues like civil aviation. I see Senator O'Brien walking around the chamber with his hands in his pockets, and I must take my hat off to some of the issues that have been raised by the opposition about transport matters, particularly civil aviation. If that committee had not been created a few years ago—and I take my hat off to former Senator Brownhill who was very instrumental in forming that committee—we would not have the opportunity to reflect in this parliament on the types of issues that are most important to rural and regional Australia. So at 5.25 a.m. on Friday, I make the point that next year the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee will continue its hardworking investigations around Australia, not just into fire blight but into many other issues that may come forward. With those few words, I will sit down and let Senator Murphy put forward his views on the world at the moment.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>21259</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I find it of great interest that at almost 5.25 a.m. on a Friday you can stand up and make a contribution in the Senate.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—Going fly-fishing, are we?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—I detect an interjection from Senator Heffernan. That is one of the few times he has actually made a contribution in the Senate. Nevertheless, listening to Senator Calvert and, of course, a few other senators here on Friday morning, it is rather interesting to consider the remarks that they made. I start with the most recent contribution, and that goes to the question of quarantine issues that affect this country. I have a degree of admiration for Senator Calvert because he has endeavoured, on a number of occasions, to at least take his own government to task on quarantine issues that have primarily, I suppose, affected the state for which he is a senator. Underlying all of that, if we look at quarantine issues per se, one of the problems that has confronted this country, and will continue to confront the country, in respect of quarantine matters is that we have a government that has removed the ability, to a large degree, of the Quarantine Inspection Service to be able to do its job appropriately. I listened to the Prime Minister—I think it was yesterday—when he addressed the question of the WTO outcome on lamb, saying what a wonderful success it was for Australian lamb producers. I agree—it was good. But, historically, if you look back at that question alone, we have failed on many occasions to take the game up to the major trading countries around the world.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Lamb—success today.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—Today—Senator Sandy Macdonald points out.

We should never have had to proceed to the WTO disputes panel and the appellant body to ultimately decide that if we had had appropriate representation in the WTO process. That, I think, is a reality for this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I know that Senator Calvert mentioned salmon and apples. In the salmon case, which was dealt with by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, it was abundantly clear from the evidence received that the process we found ourselves in was to our own detriment, even though we may have had an intention to be totally transparent to the rest of the world. We failed miserably to represent the interests of this country in any way, shape or form. That is why I make the comments with regard to lamb. It is just appalling that countries of a similar size and nature in trade terms, like Canada, take a totally different approach to the WTO process.

We clearly do not, and we have not in any way, shape or form argued our case in a lot of WTO processes. Until such time as any government—I say this in an apolitical sense—ensures that we do have the appropriate representation, we will continue to fail in a number of areas, and that will be to our detriment. Of course free trade, which has been proposed and pushed by all sides of politics in this country, is a worthy pursuit because we as a country are very efficient in primary production. But at the end of the day we have to ensure, if we are competing in a global marketplace, that the terms upon which we compete are as even as we can possibly make them.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>There are circumstances in which, insofar as this country is concerned, we have failed our primary producers. If you look back at a number of issues that have arisen, certainly since GATT and following on with the WTO, you will see that we have simply not been up to the game. Why haven't we been up to the game? My view is that we have not put in sufficient resources, from a legal point of view. I was a participating member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee dealing with the salmon case. I was interested to hear people from AQIS saying that we were the ones that were up there in the front row developing the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement in terms of trade in animal and agricultural produce—plants and so on.

How ridiculous that in 1995, in the salmon case, we prepared a draft report—prepared by our Quarantine and Inspection Service—and that the Canadians got a copy of before the industry in this country got one. The Canadians were then able to develop arguments about the outcome of a likely final report. In 1996, we prepared a final report that was different from the draft report and we said, `What is the scientific basis for the change?' We did not have a scientific basis that, in the case of salmon, said, `We believe that the restrictions that existed at that time should be removed. That was based on the scientific information available to us at the time, so let us remove them.' In 1996, the final report said, `Keep them in place.'

I guess I spoke about that issue because of my conservative colleague from Tasmania, Senator Calvert.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another very interesting aspect which this Senate may well have to deal with in the year 2001 relates to taxation. What has grown to be of significant interest to me relates to agribusiness and the taxation treatment that some agribusiness industries receive and also to what seems to have become a proliferation of prospectus based investment proposals across the whole sector of agribusiness industries. What was drawn to my attention, and something that I think I have got a reasonable degree of knowledge about, is plantation forestry. What has concerned me quite deeply has been the approach by some prospectus based companies in promoting forest plantations. The fact is that many of them contain projections and predictions about return to the investor that are simply not supportable. It is very easy to prove that to be the case, yet the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission seem to do little about that. We are already aware of many instances where the Australian Taxation Office have reassessed the tax affairs of tens of thousands of Australians to their detriment. This government believes that it has passed legislation that would deal with these issues, but clearly that is not the case. There are major problems in this industry in terms of prospectus based investment proposals, particularly in the agribusiness area, that will have to be rectified. It will be a major issue for this government and for any government in the ensuing few years. It will have to be addressed, in my view, legislatively to take account of the protection of investors, because it is abundantly clear that people are getting out there and are flogging these things and many of these companies, some of them already listed on the stock exchange, have taken advantage of people by promoting tax effective—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>05:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>21261</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—It must be the hour, but I really think there have been some very fine contributions here this morning.

No-one can really tell us what, particularly, is wrong down at the ABC. There was a 10 per cent cut—not across the board at the ABC, by the way, but in departments. Certain departments had to take 13 to 15 per cent cuts. In 1996 news and current affairs at the ABC did not receive any cuts, so other departments had to receive more. On average it was a 10 per cent cut. Every department, as you well know, had to take a 10 per cent cut. The ABC was no more quarantined than any other important department, for obvious reasons, because of the $10 billion black hole we were left. I do not think that under any analysis the ABC has suffered since then. We have had great shows like <inline font-style="italic">SeaChange </inline>and <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Correspondent.</inline> They are all still on air.

When we brought in our first budget in 1996, you opposed every measure, but that was the budget which has set up the surplus we so enjoy today in this country. If it were not for the hard decisions which we made then, we would not have the surplus we have today—which the opposition want to jump on. Mr Crean, the shadow Treasurer, wants to have an even bigger budget than we have, when we have a budget in the black. The opposition opposed us all the way.

I would like to focus on one topic. It is now almost the 10th anniversary since I made my first speech in this place. You will all be surprised to know that it focused on the Hunter Valley. Since that time, I have made many speeches on the Hunter, to the point where last year in the government Senate awards I was awarded the Blue Hills award for going on longer about any topic than anyone else. I was very disappointed not to win that award this year, so I thought I should start my run for the award next year by making a speech today on the same topic. Ten years ago, I told the Senate about the tremendous potential of the Hunter Valley and about the great contribution the Hunter Valley makes to the Australian economy. I think my first speech is the only one in the history of parliament during which, towards the end, there were a considerable number of interjections. This is very unusual in a first speech. The interjections were from both sides and from one particular group—that is, Tasmanians. Ten years on, I would like to explain that I really was not attacking Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>I told the story of the mythical island of `Hunterland'. The island of Hunterland was about 140 miles off the coast. It had its own state parliament, five representatives in the House of Representatives and 12 senators. The very point I was making was that the Hunter Valley, which has an economy the size of Tasmania and a population larger than Tasmania, at that point was going to gain only one senator, whereas Tasmania had 12. I really think I should be paid some sort of bonus for doing the work of 12 senators. In my next life, I hope I can come back as a senator for Tasmania. I soldier on alone up in the Hunter Valley as the only senator. It has been a very rewarding time over those 10 years to serve the Hunter, which had enormous potential 10 years ago and has fulfilled a lot of that potential in the last 10 years. It has gone through quite a lot of trauma over that period, but there is a great spirit in Newcastle and the Hunter and it has shown enormous resilience. A little over 10 years ago, the earthquake knocked down a fair part of the city. People were killed and whole areas had to be rebuilt. And one year ago we had the closure of the steelworks.</para><para>If 10 years ago I was predicting that what would be happening at the end of the nineties was the closure of the steelworks and then if I was to predict at that time that one year following the closure of the steelworks 40,000 new jobs were created in the Hunter Valley, some would think that that was a very courageous prediction. But that is what happened. We lost 2,000 jobs at the steelworks and we picked up 40,000 jobs. That is on the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and of the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. The Hunter has boomed, and a lot of that is because of the natural advantages of the Hunter and the way in which it has been able to attract a very wide range of industries. Ten years ago the Hunter Economic Development Council wrote a major report on the future of the Hunter and in that they identified 22 industries that had enormous potential for growth. That is what is underpinning the economy at the moment. If you fly over the area and look down and see the steelworks, from the air it looks like a one-industry town. But of course it is not; it is very diverse. As a matter of fact, the job profile of the Hunter is almost identical to that of the nation. A lot of the test marketing is done there, because it is a true reflection of Australian society in its population, its job structure and its diversity. </para><para>The foundation of the Hunter is the natural advantages it has through its geography. To the north is the blue water wonderland of Port Stevens; to the south is Lake Macquarie, the largest saltwater lake in Australia. There are the Watagan rainforests, the vineyard areas, which are diverse and extend right across from the lower Hunter to the upper Hunter, massive open-cut coalmining and major power generation. In contrast to a lot of that, in the far north of the valley is the Scone horse stud country. which is bigger in its economic impact than the bluegrass country in Kentucky. Indeed, there is a very close link between the bluegrass country in Kentucky, the Upper Hunter at Scone, Hong Kong and Arabia. What moves between those four centres is horses, personnel, expertise and money. That is a major industry, in an area where there is six per cent unemployment and a youth unemployment rate of under six per cent as well.</para><para>As you move south from there, you move into the coalmining and power generation areas then into the vineyards then into the major industries in the Newcastle region. When you talk about the area, people think that it is all heavy engineering and steel. It surprises people to hear who the two largest employers are: the largest employer is the Hunter Area Health Service; the second largest employer is the University of Newcastle. When I went to Armidale, which is considered a university city, and I was speaking to the Chamber of Commerce I said, `I bring greetings to the university city of Armidale from the university city of Newcastle,' and that surprised people. They didn't think of Newcastle in that way. In the University of Newcastle we have one of the top 10 universities in the country by any measure. It is the most diverse regional university in Australia. It has the top medical school, the second-top engineering school and a whole range of other quality faculties. It has become a major driver in the Hunter economy, as indeed universities tend to be everywhere else.</para><para>Massive change in the nature of industry in the Hunter is developing at the moment, as it moves from the smokestack age to the information age. This development is happening on the margins, in small businesses employing 10, 20, 30, 40 people, as opposed to the large industries such as BHP that used to employ thousands of people. To illustrate that contrast, I will tell a small story about two types of industries. One is textiles, and the other is information technology.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name></talker><para>—National Textiles.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—I am going to get to that, Senator Murphy. At the start of this year, National Textiles in the Hunter Valley shut down. There was a loss of 340 jobs. It made national headlines. What did not make national headlines was that, at the same time, over a year, a small group of companies involved with Internet products had formed a network association. They came to see me at the time National Textiles shut down on a different matter. They said: `You know, Senator, 340 jobs have been lost at National Textiles, but our little group of companies, between us, over the last year, have employed more people than that. But no-one noticed, because they were adding two, three, five and 10 people.' That is what is happening a lot.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Of course, the wharves are able to deliver more efficiently.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Patterson. That is very true and that is another aspect of our economy. We are moving towards a new information economy with that type of employment, but we are also redeveloping a lot of the old industrial land. They are knocking down the steelworks currently, and we are all cheering that on—except that some of the heritage people wanted to keep the massive gas holders; they thought they were heritage. Everyone else wanted to knock them down and I think that is what is going to happen. We are going to redevelop that site as a deepwater port. There is work under way to put in a major port on the east coast of Australia, at Newcastle. It is one of the best deepwater port locations in Australia and companies like P&amp;O are quite prepared to come in and do major studies on developing that type of activity. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Other things have been happening. Through a major infusion of capital from the state and federal governments, the way the city is being set up and the development of land is being considered, Newcastle is being positioned for a whole range of new industries. I would mention the Steel River project and the Honeysuckle project as two projects that will help position the Hunter for the future. The Honeysuckle project is a result of combined federal and state funding of $60 million to clear old port rail land, right on the harbour, right near the centre of the city, and to open that up for new development, which will help take the city into a very new era. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>06:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>21265</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I rise to speak about Greenwich University. Greenwich University is an organisation established by a Dr John Walsh out at Norfolk Island. This is a man who, I understand, has claim to a direct line of ascendancy to the Russian throne. He calls himself the Duke of Brannagh and is known throughout the education industry in this country as `the Duke'. He has extensive links through various other shonky organisations in the university area. His record is complemented by the Vice-Chancellor of Greenwich University, Dr Ian Murray Mackechnie, who—as I understand it—was jailed by the Victorian County Court for one year and four months after pleading guilty to embezzling $220,000 from the Anglican charity the Brotherhood of St Laurence.</para></talk.start><para>This particular organisation came to the attention of the Senate estimates committees back in February 1999 after it was established as a result of the direct intervention of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, who sought to direct the Administrator of Norfolk Island to establish the university on that island after he had received correspondence and assurances from this outfit out at Norfolk that they would be establishing an Internet university which would exist and operate only on Norfolk Island. It was quite an extraordinary proposition put to the Senate by the minister—that the Internet could be stopped at the borders of Norfolk Island.</para><para>The interesting fact about these matters is that the inquiry that the government has established, which followed the revelations of a whole series of irregularities in the operations at Norfolk, has now found that on the basis of the information provided to the committee—this is the Gallagher committee, a committee made up of Commonwealth and state officials across Australia—the Greenwich University failed to meet the review criteria and is not eligible for listing under the Australian qualifications framework. The Greenwich University does not meet the required standards for Australian degrees in the fields assessed, including theology, business, computing and health sciences, and nursing and psychology. On the basis of the evidence provided to the review committee and the assessment panels for three of the courses, Greenwich does not satisfy the review criteria with respect to quality, teaching, student support or scholarship and research, and the financial status of Greenwich University cannot be ascertained on the information made available to the committee or the financial assessor. The report goes on to tell us that the governance structures have been established but it is all too early to know whether they are operating effectively.</para><para>The recommendation of the committee, which I understand the government has accepted, is that the Greenwich University not be listed on the register of Australian qualifications framework because the standard of its courses, its quality assurance mechanisms and its academic leadership fail to meet the standards expected of Australian universities. Yet Senator Macdonald saw fit to direct the Administrator of Norfolk Island to establish this university, a university which has undermined the credibility and reputation of Australian universities throughout the world. This minister was so gullible that he thought to accept the assurance of the Duke of Brannagh that he was establishing an Internet university which would operate only on the island of Norfolk. Now we have the government itself dumping this so-called university because of its scandalous behaviour out at Norfolk. </para><para>One has to ask oneself: just how far will this government go in accepting shonky outfits like that at Norfolk? What action would this government feel was necessary to allow these sorts of outfits to be established? It would appear that this minister is prepared to accept anything at all, no matter how dubious. How completely obvious this outfit is—this outfit that pretends to offer an academic program which clearly has not met the criteria of any other university in this country and, of course, has now been discovered by the government's own committee not to meet the standards necessary in an Australian university. When I raised these concerns, what did we hear from the government benches? The government said that these were trivial matters and that I should apologise for them. Perhaps Senator Tierney, Senator Ellison and Senator Macdonald should be now asking whether they are the ones who should be apologising to the Australian people for allowing this bunch of crooks to get established and undermine the reputation of Australian universities throughout the world.</para><para>It strikes me that if anyone had done the most preliminary of investigations—which clearly this government has not done—they would have known that the outfit had travelled all around the Pacific seeking to find a home. They were rejected in New Zealand, they were rejected in Victoria, they were rejected in Hawaii, they were rejected in California, but they found Senator Macdonald and they said, `Come in spinner.' The Duke of Brannagh had found the ultimate in gullible ministers, and Senator Macdonald signed up to a proposition that said that the Internet university was going to operate on only one island, no matter how dubious its courses, no matter how many of its staff were completely unqualified and no matter what the nature of the programs—deep-sea settlements, intergalactic travel and the mysticism of various religious cults. This is the stuff of the brave new world of Senator Macdonald—he would accept anything.</para><para>What really troubles me is that this issue was allowed to get so far. On 9 December 1997, an officer of the Department of Transport and Regional Services contacted the department of education. The matter was dealt with at the junior officer level because it was Christmas and people were on holidays. A bunch of crooks were able to get established on Australian soil because the Australian Public Service could not cope in December and because they had a gullible minister who was prepared to accept anything when, clearly, every other state in the Pacific was not.

This would have gone beyond the policy intent of the government and beyond the agreement between the government and the Democrats whereby lifesaving and similar courses became GST free. It would have resulted in some swimming lessons being GST free and others being taxable. The government also opposed the amendment because, under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, which is a schedule to the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Act 1999, the Commonwealth has to seek the agreement of the states and territories before making any changes to the GST base.</para><para>However, this is an important bill that contains many measures beneficial to taxpayers.

The Labor amendment to this bill </para></talk.start></continue><para>gives the commissioner the power to decide on cancellation of registration back to 1 July. This will be of considerable benefit to small business in this country, which will be released from the paperwork and bureaucracy of the GST. This represents a significant roll-back and a significant benefit to those businesses. With those remarks, I state again that we will not be dividing.

Since the inception of the Scheme contact by the non-resident parent has been recognised within the Child Support Formula. Currently, where non-resident parents exercise contact of more than 30 per cent of the nights in the year, their child support liability is adjusted.</para><para>Most separated parents have existing court orders or parenting agreements concerning contact and these are generally used to determine the amount of contact when calculating a parent's child support liability. </para><para>(2)	This Government believes that contact with both parents is beneficial to the children of separated parents and that non-resident parents should be encouraged to maintain contact with their children following separation. This is why the Government has introduced legislation into this Parliament to amend child support legislation to provide for a fairer recognition of the costs borne by non-resident parents who have contact with their children for between 10 and 30 per cent of the time. </para><para>By recognising that these parents incur costs during contact, the proposal will improve incentives for non-resident parents to maintain contact with their children. The amendments will also provide a distinction between the liabilities of those parents who have no or minimal contact and those who have ongoing and regular contact with their children. Contact with both parents is of benefit to the development of the children, and leads to a higher likelihood of payment of child support. </para><para>(3)	It would appear that what exists in those states that have a presumption of 'joint custody' is really shared parental responsibility - which is what was introduced into the Family Law Act 1975 by the Family Law Reform Act 1995. This concept does not equate to an expectation that the children of separated parents will reside with each parent for equal periods of time. Rather parents are encouraged to agree on residential arrangements that are in the best interest of their children.</para><para>The Reform Act abolished the concepts of 'access', 'custody' and 'guardianship' (which suggested ownership of children by their parents) with a new statutory concept called parental responsibility. Section 61C of the Family Law Act now provides that each parent has parental responsibility for a child and this responsibility is not affected by changes in the parents' relationship.</para><para>(4)	The amendments to the Family Law Act mentioned in the above answer illustrate the Government's belief that shared parental responsibility is the appropriate principle upon which to determine a parent's responsibility to a child upon a marriage breakdown. The Government also believes the best arrangements for children are those where the parents have agreed. For this reason the Family Law Act encourages parents to agree on what parenting arrangements to make for their children.  </para><para>However, where parents are unable to co-operate to reach an agreement, or where there is animosity between them, it is less likely that a parenting arrangement that involves the child living equally with both parents will be a workable arrangement and may create greater dispute and anxiety within that separated family. Where the parents have sought an order from the court for such an arrangement it is, of course, open for the court to make that order if it is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of the child or children involved that the order be made. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Darwin-Adelaide Railway Link: Building Material</title><page.no>21295</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3143)</subtitle><id.no>3143</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>21295</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 31 October 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	With reference to the proposed Darwin-Adelaide railway line:</para><para>	(a) What are the types of sleepers under consideration for use on the line; and</para><para>	(b) From where would they be sourced.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>21295</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(a) and (b) The Commonwealth's involvement with the Alice Springs to Darwin railway project is limited to its commitment of $165m and the provision of the existing line between Tarcoola and Alice Springs to the consortium building the railway at a nominal rent.</para><para>	The AustralAsia Railway Corporation (AARC) set up by the Northern Territory and South Australia is responsible for managing the delivery of the project.
