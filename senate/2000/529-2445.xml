But the Statement also notes that the sunset date was originally 1 January 1997, and that it has now been extended to 1 January 2001.

However, the Statement does not specify that no person (other than the Commonwealth) will be adversely affected by this retrospectivity.

You also queried whether the deadline would need to be extended in a further twelve months.</para><para>By way of background, the Health Insurance Act 1973 provides two exemptions that allow General Practitioners (GPs) to provide specialist-type (R-type) diagnostic imaging services under the Medicare Benefits Scheme. A remote area exemption was introduced in 1990 to ensure the access and equity of diagnostic imaging services provided to patients by practitioners located outside a 30km radius of another imaging practice.</para><para>A pre-existing diagnostic imaging practices exemption was introduced in 1990 for a three-year period on the understanding that a Continuing Medical Education and Quality Assurance (CME &amp; QA) program would be developed for GPs providing diagnostic imaging services. This exemption contains a sunset clause enabling it to be further extended, and so far it has been extended seven times pending the development of the CME and QA program, the latest extension being the one referred to your committee.</para><para>Progress on the development of the CME and QA program by the industry associations was slow. However, once agreement was reached, the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Services) Bill 1999 was introduced into the House of Representatives. This requires that GPs providing services under either exemption be participating in the CME &amp; QA program.</para><para>As the Bill was not passed by the Senate before the latest sunset clause expired, there was a need to extend the clause until 1 January 2001. Providing the Bill is passed this year, there will be no need to extend the clause any further.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345</inline></para><para>In relation to the Health Insurance (1999-2000 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345, you have sought assurance that no-one has been adversely affected by the retrospectivity of the proposed amendment.</para><para>As you are aware, the regulations were amended in September 1999 to allow the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) to finalise the lodgement of statutory declarations in respect of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment by introducing a cut-off date.</para><para>A drafting error occurred in the November 1999 reprint of the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table that extended the cut-off date to providers, as well as equipment. As it was never intended to `lock-out' new providers, this error was rectified at the earliest opportunity. The retrospectivity of the amendment is to ensure any providers who may have sought eligibility in the period between 1 November 1999 and 1 February 2000 are not disadvantaged. ·	</para><para>I hope that this information is of assistance to you.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Dr Michael Wooldridge</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999 made under subsection 3C(1) of the </inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act 1973</inline></para><para>9 March 2000</para><para>The Hon Michael Wooldridge MP</para><para>Minister for Health and Aged Care</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA   ACT   2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999 made under subsection 3C(1) of the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act 1973</inline> which makes minor changes to the arrangements for the payment of Medicare benefits for a specific service.</para><para>The Explanatory Statement to this Determination asserts that “Medicare funding for the procedure [listed in the Schedule] will be provided on an interim basis, and its continuation will be subject to a 95 per cent compliance rate with quality assurance activities implemented by the [Royal Australasian] College [of Surgeons].

When the Kosovars were granted safe haven in Australia in May last year, it was on the express understanding that their stay would be temporary and that they would return home once the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees declared Kosovo secure enough for them to return. Whilst most of the Kosovars have returned to rebuild their homeland following the UNHCR's declaration that the situation was sufficiently secure for them to return, a small number remain in Australia. Requests have been made by some of these Kosovars to extend their stay on either a temporary or a permanent basis. The minister has legal obligations to consider these requests and will take action according to the law and without bias. This motion calls on the minister to abandon this process and therefore is strongly opposed by the government.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>15426</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—In response, my motion has been passed by the Senate. The issue has been debated many times in this chamber, so I will not go into it at length, but it is worth pointing out the numerous reports of the reality of the existing situation in Kosovo and the circumstances that some people have already been returned to when it is clearly not safe. The continuing insistence that it is safe to return people is obviously not supported by the facts. The law that Senator Patterson refers to is the law that the government insisted be put in place which specifically excludes people on safe haven visas from being able to test their refugee claims through the normal process that Australia has set up for everybody else. That is the process that the government insisted on putting in place, and that is the reason why those people are not able to have their claims tested through the independent process that every other refugee claimant and asylum seeker can have. It leaves it completely at the whim of the minister, who has total power and no obligation to follow due process or natural justice, and there is no avenue for appeal whatsoever.</para></talk.start></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PLANS: DEFENCE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>15427</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence (Senator Newman), no later than 3 pm on 29 June 2000, the following documents:</para><para>	(a)	Environment Management Plan for Puckapunyal;</para><para>	(b)	Environment Management Plan for Mangalore; and</para><para>	(c)	Environment Management Plan for Longlea.</para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15427</page.no><id.no>R1030</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>15427</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15427</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15427</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>EXCISE AMENDMENT (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES) BILL 2000</para><para>This Bill is part of a package of amendments to put in place a new taxation regime for alcoholic beverages, primarily to bring to excise alcoholic beverages not currently subject to excise duties, and adjust the rates of excise in light of the removal of the wholesale sales tax.</para><para>The Bill gives effect to the administrative arrangements for the collection of excise for alcoholic beverages not currently subject to excise.

The five-year agreement will come into effect on 1 July 2000. To give the measures in the bill some context, I should outline key features of the agreement. The new agreement builds on the foundations of the first and second community pharmacy agreements and further develops a positive and cooperative partnership between the government and community pharmacy. Its integrated package of measures will:</para><para>·	provide the basis for remunerating community pharmacists for their dispensing medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme;</para><para>·	improve access to pharmacy services in rural and remote Australia;</para><para>·	introduce an enhanced medication management service, which will extend and improve the assistance provided for elderly persons and allow improved management of the various medications they receive;</para><para>·	introduce a Pharmacy Development Program, with financial incentives to eligible pharmacists, to promote the achievement of quality services in community pharmacy; and ·	</para><para>·	relax the degree of regulation applying for new pharmacies to be approved to supply medicines under the PBS and for existing pharmacies to relocate from one place to another for the same purpose.</para><para>A major emphasis of the agreement package is improving Australians' access to pharmacy services, particularly by making rural Australia a more attractive place to start and run a pharmacy business. Therefore, the agreement includes an important initiative—totalling $76 million over five years—to improve access to pharmacy services in rural and remote areas, recognising that pharmacists are an important part of the rural health infrastructure. This initiative establishes a new rural pharmacy maintenance allowance to support existing pharmacies in rural and remote locations. Start-up funding is also being provided, which will target areas where there is a need for a community pharmacy and where it has proven difficult to attract one to date.</para><para>Funding is to be provided to encourage increased numbers of pharmacy graduates to take up rural practice and to introduce an Aboriginal pharmacist scholarship scheme. A proprietor succession program and a locum relief scheme are also provided to support existing pharmacists and ensure that pharmacy services are maintained in regional areas despite a significant proportion of regional pharmacists being near retirement age.</para><para>An extended medication management program—costing $114 million over five years—is also to be developed, in conjunction with the medical profession, to help older people in residential care and at home to get better access to expert pharmacist advice on the best management of the often complex array of medications they might use.</para><para>The Pharmacy Development Program will cost $188 million over five years and is a major innovation. Similar to arrangements already in place for remunerating general practitioners, the program will promote the enhanced involvement of community pharmacy in the pursuit of quality and cost effective service delivery. </para><para>Most of the provisions in the third community pharmacy agreement do not require amending the National Health Act. Indeed, in terms of PBS and remuneration to pharmacists, section 98BAA of the act requires the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to give effect to the agreement in any remuneration decisions it makes.</para><para>The bill therefore proposes minor changes to the act, where necessary, to give effect to specific agreement measures. These are:</para><para>·	amending from 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2005 the dates in the two sunset clauses relating to the life of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and related provisions governing the location of new pharmacies and the relocation of existing pharmacies;</para><para>·	removing provisions from the act that govern the payment of isolated and remote pharmacy allowances and professional allowances. The Rural Maintenance Allowance will replace the current Isolated Pharmacy Allowance and the Remote Pharmacy Allowance from 1 January 2001. The existing medication reviews in residential care facilities will also be replaced by new arrangements from 1 January 2001. Until then, the existing rural allowances and medication review payments will continue;</para><para>·	continuing the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority's role for new pharmacy approvals and relocations but removing its power over allowances, consistent with the points outlined above;</para><para>·	modifying the functions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The tribunal will continue to issue a determination giving effect to the terms of the Agreement for Commonwealth Remuneration to pharmacists supplying PBS medicines. In the absence of an agreement, the tribunal would retain its function of determining pharmacists' remuneration for supplying PBS medicines. Under the proposed amendments, it will also have functions conferred on it under part 1 of the agreement. Part 1 contains a dispute resolution mechanism which provides for a dispute to be referred to the tribunal by either party, but only as a last resort after attempts at direct negotiation and mediation have been exhausted;</para><para>·	making minor consequential amendments that are necessary because of these measures.</para><para>The bill also incorporates a regulation making power dealing with transitional or savings arrangements, should any be necessary. Existing regulatory powers in the act that will be relevant to the third agreement, such as the making of ministerial determinations under section 99L of the act to give effect to rules on the location of pharmacies for PBS purposes, will not be affected.</para><para>This third agreement is not just about paying pharmacists for their services. It is about better integrating pharmacy into the national health care framework, and it is about enhancing the quality of the pharmacy care that Australians receive and ensuring that all Australians have fair and reasonable access to essential medicines and pharmacy services. ·	</para><para>These amendments will play their part in enabling the government to put in place a comprehensive package of third Community Pharmacy Agreement measures.</para><para>Cooperative arrangements about government and pharmacy have had bipartisan support through the first and second agreements, and I believe the third agreement should continue that tradition in the national interest. I also commend the Pharmacy Guild for the professional way in which they have carried out often difficult negotiations over a fairly long period of time.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET 2000-01</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>15430</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>15430</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>15430</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the chairs of all legislation committees except the Economics Legislation Committee, I present reports on proposed expenditure in respect of the year ending 30 June 2001 together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to various committees.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the reports be printed. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>15430</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee.</para></motion><para>I wish to speak to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report tabled today by Senator Calvert on behalf of Senator Knowles. It includes a unanimous report from the committee expressing very serious concern about the failure of the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Aged Care, but particularly the Minister for Aged Care, to answer questions that were placed on notice or were asked at the estimates committee by members of the committee. I want to congratulate Senator Knowles for her assistance in this matter. She has proved to be a good chair in assisting the committee to get answers to questions. She has been proactive in making sure the committee's work was able to proceed with a degree of efficiency by applying pressure to ensure that we got answers to questions. I want to record my thanks for Senator Knowles's assistance in that. But there have been extensive delays in getting meaningful answers from the Minister for Aged Care as part of the estimates process.</para><para>It was frustrating to find at the 2 May hearing, following the events at Riverside, that the department was unprepared to answer many of the questions asked about the nursing home and the government's intervention in the nursing home. A commitment was given to provide written responses to questions taken on notice as soon as possible. A total of 83 questions were outstanding at the end of that hearing. At the start of the committee hearing on 23 May, 70 responses to those questions had been provided to the minister by the department, but only seven of those had been passed on to the committee. After the committee expressed some concern at the hold-up at the minister's office—and Senator Knowles took it upon herself to seek further information—the minister's office was suddenly able to produce 60 of those answers within the day. They had been sitting in the Minister for Aged Care's office for some time but had not been provided to the committee. I want to make it clear that the department had provided the minister's office, within a very reasonable time frame, with most of the answers, but they had not been cleared by the minister's office and had not been made available to the committee.</para><para>Included in those answers were answers to questions asked at the 7 February hearing. I was still receiving responses to questions asked on 2 May yesterday, and some are outstanding. Unfortunately, it seems that it is only when a deadline approaches—and when there is an understanding that a fuss is going to be made and some publicity given to the matter—that we get any answers to very serious questions about serious matters of public concern. What is of most concern to me today is what we do not know about Riverside Nursing Home and what we do not know about the government's intervention in the Riverside Nursing Home. The minister and the department, on her instructions, have repeatedly refused to answer questions on just what the minister was told about Riverside and when she was told. ·	</para><para>We still do not know when the Minister for Aged Care was first told about the serious risks to residents identified in the first report on the nursing home. We still do not know when the minister was first told about the death of a resident following the kerosene bath incident. We still do not know when the minister was first told about the serious risks to residents identified in the second report on the nursing home. Instead of an answer, all the parliament and the Australian public got was this response: `The minister and her office were appropriately briefed at all times.' That is just not satisfactory. The Australian public have a right to know what was involved in the intervention in Riverside, why the decisions were taken and why those residents had to experience that terrible stress and trauma. We have been unable to get proper answers from the minister's office or from the department as to the events at Riverside, as to the knowledge of the minister and as to the sequence of events. We do know there are a number of contradictions in the minister's version of events. The answers to some of the outstanding questions may well resolve many of those inconsistencies, but I am not sure that is the case.</para><para>The Minister for Aged Care claims not to have been first told about the risks to residents until some time after 22 February, despite having ordered an inspection of Riverside on 15 February and having come into the parliament to express her serious concerns. We are expected to believe she was uninterested in knowing about the residents for at least seven days after first being told that they had been bathed in kerosene. We are expected to believe she did not inquire and did not receive a report from her department as to the condition of the residents and the circumstances at Riverside. The minister claims that she did not know about the risks to residents until after a decision on the sanctions to be imposed on the nursing home was made on 22 February. The minister has claimed that she referred the events of Riverside to the Federal Police as soon as she became aware of the death. We now know the referral occurred only on 29 February. From the evidence of the department, the minister may have known about the death and the serious risks to residents as early as 19 February, but we still do not know when she knew or why she was not told, if she was not. But, if she was told on 19 February, this is at least three days earlier than claimed by the minister, and this predates the decision to impose sanctions. This is at least 10 days before the matter was referred to the Federal Police.</para><para>Having heard of the death and the risks to residents, what was the minister doing in the 10 days before the matter was finally referred to the police? Why didn't the minister immediately refer the death to the appropriate authorities—the Victorian coroner and the Victorian police? The minister has tried to use the pending court case from the former owners of Riverside on the closure as a defence against providing full information, but I think the minister has to be accountable for her actions to the parliament. She has to be accountable to the people of Australia, and she should provide answers to these critical questions about the events at Riverside. To date, we do not have satisfactory answers, and we have a refusal by the minister and the department to answer many of the key questions.</para><para>Clearly, in the case of Riverside, the timing of the minister's briefing is an important part of making a judgment about how she handled the case at Riverside—whether it was handled appropriately, whether alternative options could have been pursued and whether or not those frail and elderly people were properly treated by the Commonwealth government. The minister has made a number of claims about when she was told about events in the nursing homes. We ought to be able to verify that that information is factual. Certainly the families of the residents of Riverside have a range of questions that have been unanswered about the treatment of their relatives, and they will continue to pursue answers to these very important questions. The opposition will also support them in seeking those answers.</para><para>What we finally did get yesterday in one of the answers to questions on notice was access to the Aged Care Standards Agency's report on Riverside made in November 1999. It has taken until now, until June 2000, to get access to the report on Riverside which the agency completed in November 1999. The minister claimed in the parliament that that report gave the nursing home at Riverside the all clear. She claimed that, following the unsatisfactory report in July 1999, the nursing home had been monitored and brought up to scratch.  ·	</para><para>What we now know, after finally gaining access to this report, is that the minister's claims were untrue. The report shows that the nursing home had still not reached appropriate care standards six months after the problems had been identified. The November report indicates that:</para><quote><para>The care plan system is ineffective in ensuring that residents receive adequate clinical care.</para></quote><para>It found, on the key question of residents' care, that the performance of Riverside was unsatisfactory. Other problems were identified which led the standards agency to conclude:</para><quote><para>This practice does not ensure that residents receive consistent clinical care.</para></quote><para>So you had a very highly critical report of the Riverside Nursing Home available in November last year, yet the minister said in the parliament that the nursing home had been brought up to scratch and that it was operating satisfactorily. This report, finally released for the first time yesterday, proves that not to be the case. That means there are even more unanswered questions about the effectiveness of the monitoring of nursing homes in this country. How is it that a nursing home that had been proved to be unsatisfactory was allowed to continue to operate without the sort of supervision that would have prevented the kerosene bath incidents that occurred and the other mistreatment and lack of care of the residents at Riverside that were revealed in the reports in February?</para><para>There are a whole range of questions about the handling of the Riverside intervention that need to be answered. Unfortunately, we do not have those answers yet. The estimates process has been frustrated and the minister and the department have refused to provide full information. But I and the families will continue the pressure to ensure that we do get the full picture, because the Australian parliament and the Australian people deserve a much better explanation; they deserve answers to those very important questions.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>15432</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee.</para></motion><para>I want to make a few remarks going to the issue of commercial-in-confidence. At the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee estimates hearings, Telstra, an agency of the Commonwealth and still 51 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, were asked to provide details of contracts, specifically the nature, duration and value of contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings and any subsidiaries of Leightons Holdings. They were initially asked that question in early May at supplementary additional estimates and they took it on notice.</para><para>About an hour before the more recent estimates commenced, Telstra provided a written response to the committee in response to questions asked by me saying that they would not provide the information as requested on the basis that it was commercial-in-confidence. They would be willing to provide that information to the committee on the condition that it was received on that basis. That means that there are some implications for senators accepting that commission. When the Telstra Corporation came in later in the afternoon, we had a rather lengthy and robust discussion with them as to their right to refuse to provide to senators and members of parliament details of contracts between them and subsidiary and alternative companies. It should be noted that we were not seeking details of past contracts; we simply wanted current contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings. That is a matter of public interest because Mr Besley, who is chairing the current inquiry into service levels and the adequacy of service levels of Telstra around Australia, has had some interest and involvement through various corporate entities that he is involved in with the Telstra Corporation over the years.</para><para>The reason I raise this now is that the reference to that issue in the chair's draft is relatively minor and may not draw the attention it warrants. Accordingly, Labor senators were of the view that it was and is appropriate to take the somewhat unusual step of attaching a dissenting or minority report to the chair's draft going to that issue of commercial-in-confidence and increasing reliance by government agencies and departments and a series of public officials on the words `commercial-in-confidence'. Every time they are asked to provide information to senators in hearings, their reply is that the information so requested is commercial-in-confidence and cannot be provided. ·	</para><para>`Commercial-in-confidence' has a limited meaning and has had a longstanding limited role in this place. But increasingly, I observe, the role of Commonwealth agencies and Commonwealth departments is not to assist in the estimates hearings but to rely on commercial-in-confidence for reasons that are best known to themselves. The role of estimates and the role of senators in this place and of the parliament generally is to inquire, to make observations and to report on matters of public interest.</para><para>I would have thought a case involving officials of Telstra and officials of Leightons Holdings—that company and one of its senior officers being involved in a very public review which will make findings and may make recommendations, if accepted by government, that go to the disposal by Telstra of assets worth tens and tens of billions of dollars—would be a matter of public interest, would be a matter that this parliament should be and is interested in as a matter of our continued review. So, at this stage, I think it is appropriate to place on record the attitude of the relevant officers of Telstra. Their refusal of what were, in my view, legitimate requests to have access to the nature, duration and value of current contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings was an inadequate response and needs to be pursued in the coming weeks through actions in this chamber.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>15433</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para></motion><para>I have not received a number of responses that should have emerged from questions put during consideration of the estimates committee for the Attorney-General's portfolio.

But I take this opportunity of alerting the Senate to that fact and also to the fact that I will be pursuing the matter at some stage. It may have just been an oversight, but I certainly will be pursuing the matter. I think it is really in the interests of the government that it gets an opinion about the matter.

I mentioned the part that Mr Vic Little played in this area. He has been a very outstanding contributor to the community. He and his wife, Vida Little, are getting on in years now, and, unfortunately, Vic is a little unwell. He epitomises the ability that people have, if they try, to express themselves and to get matters up and going. The part he played in the Printing and Kindred Industries Union was great. He still publishes. He perhaps epitomises what we used to believe to be freedom of the press—that is, people using small presses to publish what they want. That has passed. He still gets his material together for May Day marches and other things as well. </para><para>The Printing and Kindred Industries Union is very interesting. They do not have branches, they have chapels. `Chapel' gives the right impression in these circumstances. Publishing and the setting out of ideas has more than just a material quality about it. True enough, this bill deals with people who may get lots of money. That is the economic dimension of the bill. The bill also deals with that matter of the heart and soul, the freedom of expression. That is well summed up in the title that the PKIU uses for its branches—that is, chapels. </para><para>When the Printing and Kindred Industries Union became part of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the then secretary allowed that union to keep the name `chapel'. The secretary then was Mr George Campbell, now Senator George Campbell.

They have contributed mightily to the Victorian community not only in terms of the conditions and wages they were able to achieve for their members but also in terms of matters of the heart and soul. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is interesting to look at publishing. In 1455, Johannes Gutenberg got the first press going. The first book he published was the <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline>. We know of the Gutenberg <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline>. Senator McGauran would know of the <inline font-style="italic">Bible. </inline>I do not know whether he knows of the Gutenberg <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline>, but he would certainly know of the <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline>. To a certain extent, I think that reflects the idea of publishing. It was a great leap forward. Great ideas could be sent or broadcast, to use modern parlance, abroad. That broadcasting was a freeing quality. It allowed people to think and read on wider plains. </para><para>It is very interesting to note what happened after the Gutenberg press came into being and its use spread throughout Europe and England. Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, you will remember that we learnt about Caxton at school—or at least I did in my time; perhaps history was not part of your curriculum, because you are some years younger than me. Caxton brought the press to England. When this new technology developed, the government reacted and brought in laws to restrict the use of the press. They said, `Even though this new technology has been developed, we have to restrict it.' They seem to have restricted it for two reasons, which I spoke about earlier. The matters of the heart, as I call them, had to be restricted. In other words, there was censorship so that people could not read what they would otherwise be able to read. People were frightened of new ideas so they restricted its use. It was also restricted to ensure that one lot of people got the economic benefit of the press while others did not.  ·	</para><para>So you had monopolies set up under the Tudors. They said that only certain people should have the benefit of the press. So under regulations which were established by the Star Chamber in Queen Mary's reign, printing was restricted to people who were members of the Stationers' Company. That sort of thing led to this fight—or `struggle' might be a better word to use—for freedom of the press. There is a book I often read which has the fairly grand title of <inline font-style="italic">English Constitutional History: From the Teutonic Conquest to the Present Time</inline>, written by a man with the fairly grand name of Thomas Pitt Tas-well-Langmead. The `present time' he was talking about was the start of the last century. He had this to say, and I think it is worth reading in this context: </para><quote><para>Of the political privileges of the people acquired or enlarged since the Revolution—</para></quote><para>and he is talking of the revolution led by Oliver Cromwell—</para><quote><para>we have still to consider the liberty of the Press—“the guardian and guide of all other liberties”—and the last to be recognised by the State.</para></quote><para>So the liberty of the press was the last to be accepted by the state. He goes on to talk about the various acts and laws which were passed to suppress the press. It is the sort of thing where, when everybody is feeling in the mood and wants to stand up for rights and liberties, they talk about the freedom of the press. It was not until quite late into the 19th century that freedom of the press got to the point we would find acceptable. It is interesting that the last area to be freed up was the reporting of parliamentary debates. That has an interesting history. Now of course we have freedom of the press. We have people in parliament reporting—reporting very well at times and not so well other times. There are some great figures we can all think about who presently report here—people like Alan Ramsay, whose daughter, Tosca, has every reason to be proud of her father and her mother, Laura Tingle. It is just nice to see that we have some good people doing good things here.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>—Do you see what he writes about the New South Wales right wing Labor politicians? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Hutchins has just interjected and asked whether I have seen what he writes about the right wing Labor politicians in New South Wales.

He said that he writes some pretty rough stuff about the Left as well. I might return to the subject of the bills. In any event, this issue has come a long way since the press that Johannes Gutenberg got going. I think the principle is the same. The questions that we face here, and which have been asked by those who have given speeches before me, are the same. What do you do with new technology? Who is going to benefit from it in terms of who is going to be able to have access to what is published by the new technology and who is going to be able to use the new technology? Choices have to be made. But the present situation is like it was after the Gutenberg Press was established in Germany and after Caxton took it up in England. It is the same in the sense that the law is going to come in and say that some people will get the benefit of this particular technology and other people will not. Although it is very much an economic contest, it is not simply an economic contest. It is also a contest of how we treat ideas, how wide ideas should be able to flow, who should put them forward and who should have control over them. That is the situation here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So the debate has flowed around the following questions: how can we hold the technology back? Can't datacasting be used to distribute more news than is presently the situation? Why do we limit datacasting? If we are going to limit datacasting, to what degree should it be limited? Those are all fundamental questions that have been around since the printing press was invented. We on this side of the chamber say that if this technology is here it should be used as widely as possible. For me to say that you cannot hold back technology is to mouth a platitude that has been mouthed again and again before me, and it is a platitude because it is true. You certainly have to have some regulations so that the material is put across properly. You have to have some sort of censorship so that there is a limit on what can be put across. They are questions that should be looked at in terms of what technology is available and in terms of ensuring that we do not hold back for whatever reasons—for economic reasons, moral reasons or ethical reasons—what we should not hold back. That is the test and that is the balance that has to be struck. ·	</para><para>The government has not achieved that balance in this case. The amendments which are being put forward on this side will achieve that balance. Debating these bills is like debating tax bills in some ways because we are talking about money and where it will go. But this talk about how matters can be published and dispersed goes to the issue of our rights and of our dignity as human beings. Publishing, writing and journalism all have an element that people always feel goes beyond the economic; often the duty they have towards the public is not discharged as well as it may be, but nevertheless it is there and I think they are noble professions. We are talking here about how we are going to limit what could otherwise be expressed. If we do that for simply economic reasons, I think we will be betraying our trust as an institution that has to look beyond the hip pocket and start to look towards the sky and the faraway hills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>15436</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank my colleague Senator Cooney for those very kind words in his contribution. The <inline ref="R1038">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000</inline> seeks to amend both the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. It is acknowledged that the former establishes the ownership conditions for broadcasting licences, while the latter regulates the usage of the spectrum, including the licensing of transmitting devices. This bill is focused primarily on regulating digital television technology in an environment where the scope of this technology is still relatively unknown, both here and overseas. The question needs to be asked, `Why is the government in such a rush to push this bill through?' The length of the Senate inquiry, which was meant to enable interested parties to voice their opinion on the bill, was limited, and therefore it did not allow adequate preparation time for parties to assemble detailed responses to this bill.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party recognises the complexity of the Australian broadcasting system. I am particularly concerned to ensure the continuing special role of the two public broadcasters: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, better known as the ABC, and the Special Broadcasting Service, better known as SBS. The role of these public entities needs to be enhanced, with particular reference to maintaining their independence, along with a sustainable funding structure that allows the ABC and SBS to operate effectively in a rapidly changing technological environment.</para><para>There are three main tenets to this bill: datacasting, multichannelling and the use of enhanced services. This bill has many deficiencies, specifically the overly restrictive content based definition of datacasting, as well as the requirement for the ABC and SBS to pay a datacasting licence fee. The restrictions on the ABC and SBS to multichannel will also have a specific impact on rural and regional Australia, which currently have only limited access to the analog network anyway. This bill will only serve to impede the emerging digital industry in Australia.</para><para>The provision of datacasting within this technology has the means to be one of the most popular aspects of the new digital environment. However, the definition as it stands is far too restrictive, particularly as it is content based. The definition as it stands will stifle this emergent industry. The Productivity Commission in its recent report on broadcasting noted that the government's policy relating to datacasting stifles competition and innovation and is at odds with major tenets of mainstream broadcasting policy. The entry of datacasters into Australia's media landscape not only can lead to greater diversity within Australia's media industry but can bring major benefits to the economy more broadly.</para><para>This bill will stifle the emergent industry through unwarranted regulation. The impact of this bill will be negative if emergent players are restricted in adequately pursuing technological advancement, and any consequent improvements in customer service, employment and economic opportunities for the industry will be limited. These would be available and accessible if this bill were adequately altered to take into account the role that the emergent digital industry could fulfil in Australia's media landscape and the wider economy. ·	</para><para>Consider what some of these potential datacasters had to say about the unwarranted restrictions placed on them through definitional constraints and access to the types of programs that have been allowed under this bill. Optus gave evidence to the committee stating that they would be unable to transmit a full variety of programming if the legislation stayed in its current form. Telstra—and I quote from the committee's report:</para><quote><para>... have maintained that datacasting should be defined as broadly as possible because it is a new industry that we are trying to create ... we need a definition that helps the industry emerge ... I see no reason for it to be as constrained as it is.</para></quote><para>News Ltd said:</para><quote><para>The bill expands what free-to-air operators can do with their spectrum, and severely limits what datacasters can do. Therefore putting free-to-air operators beyond competition.</para></quote><para>And, lastly, Fairfax, in respect of the restrictions on datacasting of educational programs, said:</para><quote><para>A program which may be educational in relation to interests of rural communities or interests of particular sections of city communities will not be available on datacasting, for no particular reason.</para></quote><para>While one of our main concerns is the accessibility to this technology for the national broadcasters, it is alarming to see, as recently as last weekend, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> saying:</para><quote><para>... all the potential new entrants into digital broadcasting—including John Fairfax, News Corporation and Telstra—simultaneously withdrew from proposed trials of “datacasting”.</para></quote><para>What is the point of promoting the technology if the government intends to stifle its use or concentrate access in the hands of a powerful few? This is one occasion when a policy of `let a thousand flowers bloom' is the best protection for the community from the abuse of monopoly power. Another issue that is of importance to datacasters and will limit their emergence is that the entertainment value of datacasting is likely to be constrained as it may be perceived to be commercially unattractive to potential datacasters. This debate is not about TV but about the real potential with this technology to bring a wide range of services to the Australian community not currently available using parallel technologies.</para><para>The degree of technological specificity of the proposed bill will in effect prevent potential datacasters keeping up with advancements as they become available. The complexity of the definition of datacasting and the use of a content- based definition will promote complexity and uncertainty in this emergent industry. These restrictions will stifle innovation and the technological opportunities for consumers alike. The inherent restrictions in a content based definition specifically concerning educational programming will harm the provision of children's programs. The value these programs have to the community in general must be recognised. And, finally, we also must question the distinction that has been made to news and current affairs programs, a distinction that is totally inappropriate. This use of a content based definition needs to be amended to remove the artificial anomalies it brings to the provision of datacasting services. On the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program on 10 May 2000 industry leaders discussed this very issue with the minister. As Paul Budde, a consultant in the field, said:</para><quote><para>Datacasting of digital television has very little to do with the old free-to-air television.</para></quote><para>But this government seems to believe that datacasters simply strive to be broadcasters and therefore restricts them unduly and is transferring old rules that simply do not apply in this environment.</para><para>The use of a content based definition rather than there being a distinction between datacasting and broadcasting is a contentious issue. No-one has denied that these are different things. The Labor Party proposes the definition of datacasting be distinguishable from broadcasting and be worded as broadcasting being the linear, passive, scheduled production of television programs on a repeatable or ongoing basis and datacasting by reference to it not being broadcasting. Labor's definition for datacasting stipulates that a datacasting service means a service, other than a broadcasting service, that delivers information, whether in the form of data, text, speech or images or in any other form, to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting bands. The correct focus should be on the difference between broadcasting and datacasting. This definition allows the Australian Broadcasting Authority to distinguish clearly between a datacasting service and broadcasting service. The distinction between datacasting and broadcasting is made on the technology and the service provided, not the content, and also remains technologically neutral. There are commonalities between datacasting and broadcasting which have to be recognised. However, the service provision is different, and that also has to be recognised in this bill. ·	</para><para>The Labor Party fully support the emergence and development of a datacasting industry. Hence, we support an industry that in its beginning stages has the flexibility for new services to develop over time. However, we also support the continued role of the national broadcasters. Many people in rural and regional Australia benefit from the variety of programming. The imposition of a licensing charge on the national broadcasters would be an illogical move. For example, if the government- funded broadcasters have to pay this fee back to the government, then their funding will have to be increased to compensate them accordingly. If their funding is not increased to compensate payment of the fee then this is tantamount to a further reduction in the funding requirements of the national broadcasters. It is illogical that the ABC and SBS be charged a datacasting licensing fee.</para><para>Multichannelling by the national broadcasters is another feature of digital television that will be invaluable. The reasons this is such an important feature of this new technology are that it will allow the national broadcasters to become more cost effective in their programming and will provide a greater regional focus along with a greater multicultural focus of programming. The national broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—are in a special position to encourage the take-up of this technology; therefore, to hold them back is tantamount to setting up this technology to fail in Australia. The ABC and SBS have already stated that to allow them to multi-channel will allow them to fulfil their charters better and more comprehensively. This is not about the ABC and SBS extending their charters and competing with the commercial broadcasters; it is about the government recognising the inherently special role that the national broadcasters play. It is about ensuring that regional and rural Australia are properly catered for in the new environment. The reality is that the national broadcasters primarily serve the regions, and it is the national broadcasters that will in effect provide the best service for the bush. Therefore, it is socially and economically responsible for the national broadcasters to be given the ability to use this technology, especially datacasting and multichannelling, to fulfil their charters, particularly in regional areas.</para><para>The argument put forward by the Federation of Commercial Television Stations, FACTS, that to support the national broadcasters is tantamount to uncompetitive behaviour is an absurdity and should be refuted. The national broadcasters in no way impact on the revenue earning potential of the commercial stations. SBS occupies approximately one per cent of the advertising revenue, and obviously the ABC is not in that business at all. So, what is the competition that the commercial stations are referring to? In fact, it is the reverse, as commercial operators seek to subsume the traditional markets of the public broadcasters. The benefits to regional and rural Australia of continued support for the national broadcasters to multichannel within the constraints of their respective charters far outweigh any criticisms there may be.</para><para>It seems in respect of this bill there are many anomalies and overlaps that are not consistent with previous policy statements by the minister. This is of particular concern in respect of enhanced programming. The problem is specifically when enhanced programming may in fact overlap as multichannelling. The pay TV industry is concerned with this as they obviously do not want their industry to suffer undue competition from free-to-air broadcasters, who have also benefited from a free loan of spectrum space to engage in these services. ·	</para><para>Community broadcasters, represented by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, are also concerned, and rightly so, about the lack of provisions in their sector for digital transition. Community broadcasters occupy a necessary and relevant space, and should be treated as such. They are obviously not the same as the national broadcasters, yet should not have to face undue constraints on them. There should be legislative certainty established by the minister, rather than this haphazard way of waiting and seeing, which seems to be the case with community broadcasters in this bill.</para><para>Captioning arrangements are another facet of this bill that are necessary for people who are hearing impaired. I support the necessary improvements in captioning arrangements, particularly having led a union that had a lot of boilermakers in it—a lot of people who worked in very heavy industry, who were subjected to constant noise every day, day in, day out, over many years and many of whom suffer from hearing deficiencies in their later years. The provision of captioning arrangements allows those people to be able to access news, current affairs and other information as efficiently as do those who have not had to suffer that impact upon their hearing loss. However, in comparison to the UK and the US these arrangements do not go far enough. I recognise the difficulties for regional and rural broadcasters, but at the same time we cannot ignore the necessity of it for those who require captioning and the worth and benefit to them, and hence to the community.</para><para>Digital technology is a new technological advancement. High definition is not being used in other parts of the world. We have no benchmark to determine how successful this technology will be or how extensive its use. Therefore, the restrictions that are being placed on the emergence of this industry in Australia are incomprehensible and could effectively destroy its ability to reach its full potential. Our national broadcasters occupy a unique role, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and in some areas are one of two broadcasters and in others the sole broadcaster.</para><para>This technology has the potential to enable people in rural and regional Australia to access a diversity of information as yet unknown to them and should not be restricted as it will be if this bill goes ahead in its current format. We cannot ignore the size of this country and the isolation that is often felt by people in regional Australia, so, again, it is incomprehensible that it is these people that will suffer from the short-sighted restrictions being put forward in these bills, especially in respect of the national broadcasters.</para><para>We have continuously heard in this chamber and in the other chamber about the focus being put on the needs of people in regional and rural Australia, the needs of people in the bush, to get access to modern day communications, to have the same benefit of the communications environment that exists in the capital cities. The way in which the government is treating the introduction of digital technology, is treating the restrictions in terms of data broadcasting, will simply further impede the capacity of this parliament and further impede the capacity of companies in the communications industry to be able to provide real and lasting benefits to people in rural and regional Australia in terms of allowing them to also get maximum benefit out of the new information environment within which we live. It would be an absolute farce, another farce, to once again see the junior coalition partner—the so-called National Party of Australia; the people who purport to represent the people in the bush—go along with supporting this bill and, again, by doing so deny the opportunity for people in rural and regional Australia to have real access to real services, real technology, that would allow them to play a real part in the Australian economy and within the Australian community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15439</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I go to the substantive matters that I wish to address in this debate on the <inline ref="R1038">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000</inline> this morning I also as an aside wish to give thanks for the contribution of Senator Campbell, who has coalesced some of my thoughts about the issue, particularly the issue about regional and rural Australia, when I recall my youth. We stand here on a precipice of change, a change that will come about. It will come inexorably about. It will come about despite this government's narrowmindedness about change and about how it embraces new technology and how it goes about trying to restrict what would otherwise be a very useful innovation. ·	</para></talk.start><para> In fact, when I look back, I can say that in my youth I have always been with television. The debate is not about television as such; it is about new technologies. I was born some time after television was introduced into this country in 1956, so I have always had it as background noise and as a medium to watch. One of the times that I found myself unable to watch it was in rural and regional Australia, in Cunnamulla. One of the profound things that occurred in my youth was that I ran into the living room, looking for the television, `the box', and it was not there. It was not there because, for a range of factors, technology had not been supported, pushed and delivered to regional and rural Australia. So, for a while, there was no box. When I was in Roma, the same thing occurred: colour television was upon us, and it was one of the earlier things my family purchased to ensure that we would have colour. I recall watching test patterns in colour.</para><para>Youth are interested in changing technology. The youth of today are interested not in Collins Street National Party people but in people who wish to embrace new technologies, look at change and embrace change. If you recall the need for changing technologies, the youth of today will participate and expect these types of changes. They will expect that the government of the day leads the way forward and allows new technologies to be embraced. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> headed `TV's big dollars in the balance' says:</para><quote><para>The three big would-be datacasters, Telstra, John Fairfax and News Corp, last week attempted to place serious pressure on the Coalition, ALP and Democrats by pulling out of datacasting trials.</para></quote><para>It is disappointing to find that datacasting as it stands is a matter that is being played with in a manner that might in fact throw it into the dustbin.

The development of technology has not been impeded by government in any serious way. I recall when computers were first about. Having been through a generation which spans not only television but also the development of computers, my early exposure to computers themselves was about punch cards. I was part time at the Queensland Institute of Technology, where computer science and technology was being taught through punch cards and a mini mainframe. To do 4GL language, we had to use overheads, because the technology to bring that into a classroom had not been developed at that point. It had not got to a point where we could then disseminate it and develop it. Very quickly, the technologies came about. Very quickly, the educational institutions picked up the technology and delivered it to students. It took a lot longer to get out to regional and rural Queensland and regional Australia. It took a lot longer, for a range of reasons, but those reasons should not include government's restrictive enactments. The technology should be able to be delivered in a timely and appropriate way.</para><para>Turning to the substantive elements of the matter, the purpose of the bill is to refine arrangements for the introduction of digital television and establish a system for the regulation of datacasting services. The conversion to digital broadcasting requires amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The former act sets out the ownership and programming conditions for broadcasting licences and is administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The latter act regulates the usage of the spectrum, including the licensing of transmitting apparatus, and is administered by the Australian Communications Authority. ·	</para><para>Datacasting is defined in the digital conversion act as a service, other than a broadcasting service, that delivers information to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information, where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting service bands. This definition of datacasting, as it stands, is overly restrictive and complicated and goes beyond restricting datacasting to services that do not constitute broadcasting. Labor believes that, while datacasting cannot be de facto broadcasting, the definition should be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. This restrictive definition has had a considerable impact on would-be datacasters. According to the Internet Industry Association of Australia, the restrictive provisions in this bill are:</para><quote><para>. . . the kiss of death for the development of a multi-billion-dollar datacasting industry in Australia.</para></quote><para>They go on to say:</para><quote><para>A golden opportunity to have the entire Australian population online within three years was about to be thrown aside.</para></quote><para>Similarly, Telstra has recently stated that it is:</para><quote><para>. . . disappointed with the Datacasting Bill as it raises serious questions abut the viability of datacasting in Australia. </para></quote><para>It is crucial that this emergent industry is not stifled in its development and innovative capacity by overly restrictive regulation and that the benefits for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services and employment and economic opportunities should not be constrained. For the same reasons, we also oppose the genre based content definition of datacasting and call upon the government to depart from that approach. The current provisions prevent datacasters from providing content in genres regarded as the province of free-to-air television.</para><para>The genre restrictions will also greatly restrict the viability of datacasting and are fundamentally anti-competitive. The monthly newsletter on Australian telecommunications and media law cites a number of companies voicing their strong opposition to these provisions in the bill, with OzEmail arguing that it would not be financially viable to invest in developing a datacasting business within these constraints. Labor, on the other hand, supports an approach that favours flexibility, minimises barriers to entry and allows new services to develop over time. </para><para>The basis of the amendments we propose to put forward to achieve this is in the report on the <inline ref="R1038">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000</inline> of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The report provides an overview of both the bills in question, together with some very good background material on the new technology we are referring to today—datacasting, digital television and HDTV. The report also contains a minority report from the Labor senators. In the executive summary on page 64 there is an outline of matters that go to developing appropriate and proper digital and datacasting services in Australia, and a number of recommendations have been put forward in support of that. Those recommendations provide, subject to the regulatory conditions of the existing broadcasting regulatory framework, a new definition of a datacasting service; namely, that a `datacasting service' means a service—other than a broadcasting service—that delivers information, whether in the form of data, text, speech, images or in any other form, to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information, where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting services bands.</para><para>Like the government's framework, this proposed framework confirms the 1998 legislative position that datacasting services cannot be broadcasting services. Similarly, the proposed framework provides that those matters allowed without constraint in the government's bill remain unconstrained in the model effected by these proposals, for example, parliamentary broadcasts. Unlike the government's bill, which seeks to limit or restrain the creative and economic potential of what might be offered by potential datacasters, this framework considers both the physical attributes of emerging digital services and the intent of services provided, in order to make a distinction between broadcasting and datacasting services. ·	</para><para>Labor believes the national broadcasters should have the ability to multichannel content consistent with the operation of their respective charters; broadcasters should be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes and should be exempted from payment of datacasting fees; regulatory arrangements pertaining to the ABC and SBS should be incorporated into their respective acts; the silly decision to impose datacasting fees on the national broadcasters should be reversed; they should be exempted from payment of those types of fees; and national broadcasters should be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes.</para><para>There is broad support for allowing the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel. There is no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel, particularly when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. The ABC do not come into what you would call direct competition; unlike the commercial free-to-air broadcasters, they do not have paid advertisements. They do not come into direct competition with the subscription broadcasting industry or the pay TV industry, but they perform essential public and national interest good, particularly in rural and regional Australia—and should not be abandoned. The government's restrictions on the ABC and SBS being able to multichannel will do disproportionate harm to rural and regional Australia as those areas are deprived of what could be a flourishing new information service. On the issue of regional Australia, Steve Lewis writes in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>:</para><quote><para>Regional Government members of parliament have been warned the Coalition's digital broadcasting reforms will reduce the amount of sport and other programs delivered to the bush by pay-TV operators.</para></quote><para>The article goes on:</para><quote><para>Austar United, the regional pay-TV operator, also suggested that its $800 million proposed investment in regional Australia could be threatened if the government's proposals were legislated. </para></quote><para>The article quotes a letter to government regional members of parliament by the chief executive officer of Austar United, Mr John Porter:</para><quote><para>In his letter, Mr Porter expressed `concern at the Government's latest proposed amendments to the digital television regime'.</para></quote><para>The aspect that is of concern, and the theme I have developed today, is that regional and rural Australia will suffer as a consequence of this government's bills. Similarly, they will lose out with the problems that they face more generally, in addition to the direct issues of access to new technologies, digital television and datacasting services. Labor senators acknowledge the legitimate concerns of the national broadcasters that the genre based content definition of datacasting might impinge on programming decisions that are properly the province of their boards. However, the definition of datacasting in the bills gives occasion for this concern. Specific provisions that might apply to datacasting by the ABC and SBS might more appropriately be contained within the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. The former Managing Director of the ABC recently commented that it was extraordinary that the government was preserving the status quo with a regulatory regime that was far too restrictive. He stated that the ABC will be at a huge disadvantage with these bills, which have a severe effect on its ability to keep pace with the digital revolution. The provisions offering enhanced services by free-to-air broadcasters are substantively different from those previously proposed.</para><para>Labor believes that the government's enhanced services framework, to more accurately reflect the framework announced in 1999, should contain matters, firstly, that the Senate committee addressed, which go to allowing overlap of broadcasts where an unexpected delay or extension in the time of one broadcast coincides with the scheduled broadcast of a news bulletin; secondly, that go towards maintaining enhanced service provision for free-to-air broadcasters at the level described by the December 1999 announcements of this government; and, thirdly, that allow simultaneous transmission of content additional to the primary broadcast content, provided the additional content has a `direct and obvious' link with the primary broadcast.  ·	</para><para>These bills contain a range of provisions that develop a framework for the regulation of digital television, and a range of deficiencies have been identified in the following areas, as stated in the Senate report: the datacasting regulatory regime, the rights of administrative appeal and the regulation of technical standards. It is believed that a range of proposals to assist with the regulatory framework and to develop more appropriate regulatory conditions are necessary. Those that go to the ABA's power to rationalise and clear spectrum for datacasting should be enhanced. In addition, a `use it or lose it' provision for datacasting transmission licences should be incorporated into the datacasting framework, and the calculation of a commercial television licence holder's datacasting fee should be subject to parliamentary disallowance. Lastly, review of datacasting transmission licences should include competitive and regulatory arrangements and `revenue to the Commonwealth' provisions. </para><para>Turning to the regulatory issues, Labor believes that the bills deny interested parties the ability to access stay powers or seek injunctive relief in relation to the ABA. In summary, it is not about datacasting being backdoor or de facto broadcasting. The government's model is simply not sensible. Datacasters will not be broadcasters. Labor has relied on an attributes basis to distinguish them rather than a content basis, which is the model of the government. Labor's approach underpins our objective for Australia to become a knowledge nation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Paul (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Calvert)</inline>—Before I call Senator Schacht, I will remind him—he has been here long enough to know—that it is classed as disorderly and against the standing orders to walk between the chair and the person speaking.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15443</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Will I be flogged at lunchtime or put away in the dungeon of the privileges committee?</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Disgraceful behaviour!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.

These bills are part of the long, ongoing saga that this government has created for itself about how to establish a regulatory regime for the new broadcasting and telecommunications technologies that are now sweeping the world and sweeping Australia. The government's whole attitude to this area over the last four years has been completely dominated by how it thinks it can curry favour with the various existing media moguls and proprietors in this country. You do not have to be a genius to work that out. Obviously, politicians on all sides are sensitive to those who control, own and run the media that report political developments and political issues in this country. But, in my view, it has been humiliating in many ways that this government has done everything possible to curry favour with a particular media proprietor. There is no doubt that, on a whole range of issues, it has decided to align itself with the fortunes of PBL, or Mr Packer and his companies. This has upset Mr Murdoch and his companies and, accordingly, there have been some public statements.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe that, whenever you attempt to conduct a policy structure for media, broadcasting or telecommunications in this country, if you start on the basis of currying favour, you will end up with a mess. The only principle that should guide the formation of policy for the media in this country is to aim for maximum diversity of ownership of the media and maximum plurality of content. I have said before that all politicians of all parties of all governments have never been 100 per cent pure about that; there has always been the pressure and the concern about what the media will do to government and politicians if they appear to be opposing the interests of the media.</para><para>There is no doubt that, as public policy makers, we should, wherever we can, separate our nervousness or anxiety about how we may be reported or treated by a particular media outlet from the issue of what is best for the operation of a pluralistic, democratic system. We should try to get it right in the long term rather than trying to appear to appease the interests of various media owners. As a former shadow minister for communications, I am as aware as anybody of the pressures that operate in this area on all politicians on all sides, but I have always believed that, if possible, you should argue for those two principles: diversity of ownership and plurality of content. ·	</para><para>The bills before us do not do anything to extend the diversity of ownership of the major media forms in this country. I think we may be missing an opportunity in the operation of digital data and datacasting to ensure that there are more effective new players coming into the market to add to that diversity of ownership. But time will tell whether my comments about that are correct or whether I am unnecessarily pessimistic. We are debating these bills because, two years ago—when the government first introduced the legislation for a regime to regulate digital broadcasting, data broadcasting and the introduction of high definition television—the Senate refused to give the government carte blanche to regulate by administrative decision in all of these areas. We insisted in the Senate that the government would have to come back to the parliament and debate the definitions in the various areas of multichannelling, digital data, et cetera. I think we have been proved correct in that it was a good policy for the Senate to have adopted with the opposition, the Democrats and the Independent senators.</para><para>It is disappointing, though, that when the government returned here with this legislation they still took an unnecessarily restrictive and narrow view of what these rules and regulations should be. They took the bizarre decision that the ABC and SBS, as national broadcasters, should not be able to multichannel. This has been roundly condemned by everybody else in the community, and I am told that even the commercial broadcasters support the ABC and SBS having the right to multichannel. Of course, we want to provide increased broadcasting services in rural areas, and multichannelling will be one way that that can be achieved if the ABC and SBS are able to do it. At the moment, in some areas of regional and rural Australia, people get an effective reception of only two channels: one is the ABC and one is commercial. They may also receive some SBS. They may now be able to get several further channels and get a diversity of programming, whether it is entertainment, education, sport or arts programs. We would all welcome that. </para><para>The rest of us—those other than the inner cabal of the cabinet—could not work out the policy justification for denying the ABC and SBS the ability to multichannel. It appears from public comments from both the Labor Party and the Democrats that there is now a majority in the Senate to force those amendments so that those two public broadcasters will be able to multichannel. I see that today it appears the government have finally seen commonsense, have rolled over and will agree to it. That is a very welcome decision by the government, and it is a good decision for our national broadcasters.</para><para>When I went to one of the committee hearings on this legislation, the new Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Shier, was there. He was very forthright, as was the Chairman of the ABC, who is a close friend of the Prime Minister, and they were arguing strongly for multichannelling capacity for the ABC. Mr Shier made quite a reasonable case for it. As Mr Shier has been appointed by a board that is now overwhelmingly appointed by the present government, one could see that even those who have been appointed to the ABC board with the support of the government could not understand the government's decision.</para><para>I say as an aside that, although I agree with Mr Shier's remarks and the need for the ABC to multichannel and multibroadcast, I cannot agree with some of the ways he has gone about reorganising the ABC. The way a number of senior people have been treated is a good example. I understand, for example, that some of the very senior executives of the ABC who have had their jobs wiped out, who have effectively been sacked, never had an opportunity to speak to Mr Shier before they were actually in the conversation in which he dismissed them. That was even though he had been there for some two or three months. I find that an odd way for a chief executive to work. I find it odd that he did not discuss it with the existing senior managers and make his own judgment about their capabilities. To just leave them hanging for two or three months and then to call them in and say, `You're dismissed. I've got no job for you,' is a bit of an odd way to work. I do not think it engenders good morale in an organisation if people can have their heads lopped off without any prior warning or discussion. The proof will be in the pudding of Mr Shier's appointments and restructuring of the ABC. I look forward to hearing his explanation at the next Senate estimates hearing of how his new structure for the ABC and his new appointments will improve the quality of the ABC as a national broadcaster. ·	</para><para>I now turn to the digital datacasting definitions. The proposals by the Labor Party offer a very sound and sensible definition. The government clearly had a very restrictive definition purely to satisfy the interests of the free-to-air operators in Australia. Those definitions are unnecessarily restrictive and do not allow the full development of datacasting in this country as a new form of service to Australian consumers. Therefore, I hope the Senate carries the definitions put forward by our shadow minister Stephen Smith on behalf of the Labor Party, and I hope the government again sees sense—as it did over the multichannelling for the ABC—and accepts these amendments. The government's definitions will collapse anyway, because they are so restrictive. They will have the ABA endlessly chasing data broadcasters down every burrow and warren trying to find out whether there was a breach here or a breach there. It will not be light-handed regulation, which the government says it is always in favour of; it will be heavy-handed regulation, designed to restrict data broadcasters from developing the new services—to the advantage of existing free-to-air broadcasters only, not to the advantage of Australian consumers.</para><para>We should acknowledge that the free-to-air broadcasters got a major advantage from the initial legislation in the introduction of digital broadcasting by having a guarantee that their existing licences would last until 2007. That is a guarantee that they are the only ones who will be free-to-air broadcasters in this country—a significant advantage. I cannot think of any other major industry where the existing players have been guaranteed by government legislation, with no increased or further payment, an existing entitlement to stop competition coming in against them. At the time, two years ago, we tried to reduce the period of time. We agreed there should be some guarantee to help the cost of the introduction of high definition television, to encourage its uptake and the development of programming and the equipment that would be needed, which is costly. There was a reasonable case, but we did not think the length of time granted was necessary or appropriate.</para><para>Some economically dry commentators in the media—and even in the Treasury and the cabinet—would have liked to have seen the auction of those licences in the next year or so, particularly the auction of all the digital spectrum for either HDTV broadcasting or standard digital broadcasting. In view of what is being paid around the world, the government has forgone an opportunity to raise not hundreds of millions of dollars but billions of dollars of revenue. Some other media commentators—led by the News Ltd organisation, which does not have a licence and which is prohibited, under the existing cross-ownership rules, from having a licence—keep pointing out that the existing free-to-air broadcasters have a great economic gift available to them whereas elsewhere in the world it would have been put up for auction. If people are willing to pay several billion dollars to get into the new third level of mobile telephone technology, one can imagine what others would have been willing to spend to get the licence for digital television. Only recently, the last FM licence in Sydney was sold for $120 million. Let me repeat: one FM radio licence for broadcasting in Sydney went for $120 million at auction. You can therefore imagine what digital licences could have brought in if they had been auctioned right across Australia.</para><para>The government is forgoing that. If they restrict the definitions of digital data too much, maybe no-one will bid. There is not much point in bidding for something that is too restrictive. There must be an interesting argument between people like the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Assistant Treasurer and people from Treasury, who are always looking at ways of raising revenue. They have been forced to forgo an opportunity to raise more revenue to pay for the services of the community. Some more money for the ABC and SBS could be provided from the income of these licences if they were put properly to the Australian people. ·	</para><para>I want to conclude on a matter that shows the government is not able to understand that technology is going to make this legislation irrelevant. That is why we are recommending a number of statutory reviews over the next two or three years. This piece of legislation will fall apart and be ineffective almost from the day it is gazetted if it gets through the parliament in the way the government wants it to. I draw the attention of the chamber to an article by journalist Ivor Ries that appeared on 15 June in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. Part of the story indicates that Telstra is now seriously considering bidding for the AFL football rights for 10 years and paying a figure that is rumoured to be in excess of $1 billion. That is for the full AFL television rights for free-to-air television, pay TV and the Internet. Telstra would use those rights to put the AFL on Foxtel, which it half owns. When I saw the article, I thought, `This does raise a number of interesting implications.' I am sure Mr Packer, Mr Stokes and Mr Asper—who own the three free-to-air commercial stations—might have a view about bidding against Telstra. If Telstra does put a bid in, I bet anything you like, Mr Acting Deputy President, those three media owners will hotfoot it to the Prime Minister immediately, demanding that Telstra not be able to bid, because it is against their interests.</para><para>Telstra does have the money to bid. Telstra does have the delivery system. It would clearly on-sell to the free-to-air stations, put the AFL football on its pay TV operation and, above all else, reserve for itself AFL Internet rights to develop its part of the communications network. In all, it may well be a very good outcome for Australia that the national carrier, 51 per cent owned by the Australian people—although the government is trying to sell it off—would, in public interest terms, be providing a greater service and a greater spread of AFL football around Australia. To see the Crows win more premierships in the near future would be a good outcome.</para><para>What it does show is that this government is flat-footed. If the national telecommunications carrier is seriously preparing a bid for AFL television rights, it just shows you that the old mindset of this government in handling regulatory arrangements is outdated. Will the government use its 51 per cent ownership to direct the Telstra board not to bid for AFL football rights? It will be an interesting test because the minister, Senator Alston, has always refused in any way to direct the Telstra board. I suspect there will be no direction. The weights will just be put on individual board members who have been appointed by the minister if they believe it is not in the interests of this government to upset the existing media owners.</para><para>This legislation is, as I said before, going to die and be ineffective almost from the day it comes into effect if it is not amended by the sensible amendments being put forward by the opposition and the Democrats. ABC multichannelling is a must. The definition to widen the broadcast of digital datacasting is a must. The issues of how to effectively manage the new regulatory regime have not been covered in this legislation. So we look forward to the debate in the committee stage and hope that the Senate will be able to convince this government that the legislation at the moment is overwhelmingly defective and is not in the interests of the Australian people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15446</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I concur with many of the remarks and proposals put forward by Labor and Senator Schacht.

After all, the digital spectrum does belong to everybody; it is a public resource. How that resource is handled is a matter for government. What this legislation does is lock up that resource for a few—in particular, for a few already big players. It is the existing commercial networks that are being given that resource dirt cheap. ·	</para></talk.start></continue><para>Following on from what Senator Schacht said, there is no doubt that the auctioning, allocation, tendering for and selling of that resource would potentially enrich the public coffers, the public owners, by many billions of dollars. With the government looking in the future to ways of resourcing important items like the environment, it is one of those options that it has quite unnecessarily closed down. The existing free-to-air networks fear that, if the datacasting provisions are too lax, other players will be able to backdoor broadcast—that is, rather than just provide teletext type services, they will be able to provide content that will be in competition with this service. Well, why not? The Productivity Commission found that the rules are too restrictive, and I agree with Labor that the whole thing needs to be rejigged. There is a real concern that the influence of the current big players in television in particular has blinded the government to a public obligation to open up this technology for the advantage of Australians—it is inevitably going to happen; it is just that we are going to be decades behind—and also to give information technology a boost so that Australia goes to the forefront instead of being at the back of what is going to be one of the great industries of the 21st century, one of the great sources of wealth and, of course, one of the great sources of jobs.</para><para>I note that the Democrats will be supporting many of the measures that Labor has mooted, or they will be putting forward similar measures, to allow liberal use of datacasting, but I am concerned that they are going to oppose some of the Labor amendments which would allow a very broad definition of datacasting. I would have thought the Democrats would be keen on busting up the existing media monopolies when the opportunity came or at least affording Australians the broadest access to different media outlets possible.</para><para>High definition TV comes into this. It is important, but everyone seems to have just about given up on it because it has been government policy for so long. It was legislated last year and has led to very little action. Mandatory high definition TV along those lines seems unique to Australia. It needs to be reviewed. It has just been the wrong way to go. It may suit the existing networks, but increasingly even that seems to be not totally the case. But it will not service the best interests of the most important people as far as we as representatives in a democracy are concerned, and that is the 19 million Australians out there who are looking forward to the best in the world when it comes to communications. I note the comments of Alan Kohler in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on Saturday, 17 June where, amongst other things, he said:</para><quote><para>Why John Howard and his Communications Minister, Richard Alston, remain so determined to press on with a bill that now has absolutely no support beyond the three commercial TV networks has become an abiding mystery to observers of media policy.

When the minister—usually Alston—has got that off his chest, they then start talking about the unrelated matter of broadcasting policy. </para><para>Unrelated? Well, it turns out that the two big newspaper companies and Telstra, all desperately keen to become broadcasters, have been such big losers out of the digital TV policy that they are giving up. So well have potential competitors been blocked from the TV business, there is universal agreement, outside the Government and the networks, that Australia's conversion to digital TV is doomed. </para><para>The policy is not just a dud that won't achieve its aim of converting the nation to digital by 2008. It also represents a decision by the Government to forgo billions in revenue, as well as the well-understood benefits of competition and the chance to thrust Australia to the global forefront of technology, all to protect the existing broadcasters from having to deal with competition from newspaper and phone companies.</para><para>Even the networks agree full conversion to digital in 2008, as required by the policy, will probably be impossible. The head of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, Tony Brannigan, told a Senate committee last week (regarding digital take-up): “I would not be at all confident that by 2008 we would be much beyond the 50 or 60 per cent mark.”  ·	</para></quote><para>That is a column worth reading in full.</para><para>The ABC and SBS are important focuses in this. They should have the right to datacast and multichannel without restriction so that they can reach more people with more content, and with a different form of content.

They are outlets, in relation to not only news but also entertainment, which are coveted by people all around the world. With new technology, it is very important that they are players so that the particular quality of service they bring the public is available in the new formats. I am very pleased to hear that the Democrats and the Labor Party are much more aware of that than the government. Quite clearly, they are quite determined to see that the ABC and SBS have their opportunity in this new world of information technology.</para><para>So the Greens support the amendments coming from this side of the house.

In 1998, all the main parties supported an extension of the moratorium on new commercial free-to-air television broadcasters until the end of 2006; the loaning of seven megahertz of spectrum free of charge to all free-to-air broadcasters, including the ABC and SBS, with a requirement that they broadcast in high definition; a requirement to simulcast in analog and digital for at least eight years; and a prohibition on multichannelling by free-to-air commercial broadcasters until 2005. </para></talk.start><para>The legislation before the Senate reflects the framework agreed by the coalition, Labor and the Democrats in 1998 and builds on this framework by establishing the rules that will govern datacasting and enhancements. In relation to datacasting—the issue that has caused most conjecture over the last month—it seems to me that no-one in the parliament is seriously disputing the government's position that datacasters cannot be broadcasters and that they must offer a service that is different to broadcasting. Rather, the issue is: what is the most effective means of ensuring that while datacasters are not broadcasters they can still offer an attractive array of non-broadcasting services? </para><para>The government considered this matter in great detail during the reviews that were conducted between June 1998 and the introduction of this legislation earlier this year. The clear conclusion from these reviews was that the genre based regime is the most effective and practical means of providing certainty to broadcasters and datacasters. The government rejects the claim that the genre based regime is so tight that it will not allow datacasters to establish viable businesses. It must be remembered that the datacasting spectrum will enable datacasters to reach nearly 100 per cent of the population offering a wide array of information, e-commerce and educational products and services. </para><para>Probably the most vexing issue in this debate is the provision of Internet content by datacasters. The point that needs to be made on this issue is that to seek to exempt material merely because it is on the Internet is really seeking to water down the rules which prevent datacasters from being broadcasters because any content can be placed on the Net, from text to full motion video. A number of senators may well be aware that there have been stories in recent days regarding the virtual avalanche of new Internet television sites springing up in the United States. Those who are asking the government to make different rules for content controlled by datacasters but which is really on the Internet are really asking for the rules to be relaxed across the board.  ·	</para><para>A number of other issues have been raised during the debate. I am sure they will be discussed at greater length during the committee stage next week. In relation to enhancements, it has always been puzzling to me that the same people who argue that the datacasting rules should be relaxed argue that the enhancements should be more tightly constrained. The claims by some that the government has welshed on a deal in relation to enhancements are totally false. In 1998, the government made it clear that it would not allow free-to-air broadcasters to multichannel—that is, to provide full-blown sports channels, news channels, movie channels or any other simultaneous channels. </para><para>The overlap provisions only relate to those few instances where a sporting event runs over time due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather delays and play-offs. To only allow the overlap when the other program is a news program is nonsensical. The same sport at the same venue at the same time provision is tightly confined and only one sport is likely to be affected—that is, tennis, and only in the early rounds of tennis matches. Any claims that such a narrowly applicable provision will have a massively detrimental impact on existing businesses are gross overstatements. </para><para>Obviously, the issue of whether the national broadcasters should be allowed to multichannel will be further considered in the committee stage. However, it is the government's view that all free-to-air broadcasters should be treated equally in the digital environment. The 1998 decision not to allow the free-to-air broadcasters to multichannel, so as not to encroach on the primary business of the fledgling pay television industry, was supported by all the main political parties. A decision now to allow the national broadcasters to provide unrestricted multichannelling would run contrary to the 1998 decision. I conclude by thanking all those who have contributed to the debate and by commending the main political participants for the way in which they have sought to tackle this complex and prominent matter of public policy in a serious and constructive fashion. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of these bills in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15449</page.no><id.no>R718</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>15449</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 11 May.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives amendment</inline>—</para><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 4, page 123 (before line 6), before item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1A  Paragraph 541B(1)(b)</inline></para><para>Repeal the paragraph, substitute:</para><para>	(b)	the person:</para><para>	(i)	is undertaking in the particular study period (such as, for example, a semester) for which he or she is enrolled for the course; or</para><para>	(ii)	intends to undertake in the next study period for which he or she intends to enrol for the course;</para><para>		either:</para><para>	(iii)	in a case to which subsection (1A) does not apply—at least three-quarters of the normal amount of full-time study in respect of the course for that period (see subsections (2) to (4)); or</para><para>	(iv)	in a case to which subsection (1A) applies—at least two-thirds of the normal amount </para><para>of full-time study in respect of the course for that period (see subsections (2) to (4)); and ·	</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1B  After subsection 541B(1)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">When two-thirds study load applies</inline></para><quote><para>	(1A)	This subsection applies for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) if the person cannot undertake the normal amount of full-time study in respect of the course for that period:</para><para>	(a)	because of the usual requirements of the institution in question in respect of the course; or</para><para>	(b)	because of a specific direction in writing to the student from the academic registrar, or an equivalent officer, of the institution in question; or</para><para>	(c)	because the academic registrar, or an equivalent officer, of the institution in question recommends in writing that the person undertake the amount of study mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) in respect of the course for specified academic or vocational reasons.</para><para>		Paragraph (c) applies for no longer than half of the academic year.</para></quote><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15450</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government requests for amendments and a consequential amendment to be moved to this bill.

They are long overdue. We are happy to allow the government to push ahead with its amendments in order to satisfy the outcome that we have all been hoping for—the Democrats since 1990, the opposition since April and the government since the budget—of ensuring a discounted rate for assets for farming families. We are sorry that it has taken so long. We are proud that the Democrats kept the government to its 1996 election promise. I am happy to see the withdrawal of any amendments standing in my name and to not press the request in order to achieve this outcome. We are aware of a government argument that the initial amendment, as it states on the notes on requests and amendments that were circulated for the Senate, was technically difficult as a consequence of the drafting process. As you would know, we recirculated a new amendment that dealt with that technicality. So it rests now only on the ethical or moral arguments of the government as to why it could not press ahead with the original Democrat amendment. As I say, we will not be postponing this process any further and we are glad to see that rural students will be assisted in this way, after a long period of time, unfortunately.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Requests and amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><quote><para>Schedule 4, item 9, page 126 (line 14) to page 128 (line 8), omit the item, substitute: ·	</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">9  Point 1066A-B1 (table and notes)</inline></para><para>Repeal the table and notes, substitute:

I just cannot see how that can be so and that is a matter that the committee should pursue much further with Treasury. For those who have 80 per cent or more of their income from one source and its associates, the legislation provides that a contractor can avoid being taxed as an employee if he can achieve a Personal Services Business Determination from the tax commissioner. In this regard the legislation is almost falling over itself to help contractors to continue to avoid tax. It provides for four tests, as is being discussed, only one of which has to be passed. So there are three tests for a personal services business—the ones we had before—and a fourth for those who fail all of those: that the contractor is contracting to produce a result, not just work for a certain period, that he supplies his tools of trade and is liable for the cost of rectifying defective work. So, again, every effort has been made to minimise the impact.</para></quote><para>In addition, in order to be considered a legitimate personal services business, only one of the four tests needs to be met. The CFMEU argued that the measures in themselves are inadequate and will not address tax avoidance. They said:</para><quote><para>It will not be too difficult for lots of creative people with all their accountants assisting them to en masse avoid the so-called crackdown on the tax avoidance in the building industry. </para></quote><para>The CFMEU went on to say:</para><quote><para>I predict that the cash economy will be back in a very big way in the building industry . . .</para></quote><para>Given the weakness of the tests they will result in tax avoidance flourishing.

In a letter to the CFMEU, ACOSS highlight:</para><quote><para>The main weakness of the Bill and it's such a serious one as to undermine the basic objectives of the Ralph proposal lies more in the tests for determining whether a person is an employee or contractor rather than the transitional arrangements. In our view a tax-payer should not be exempted from the provisions of the bill on the basis that he or she “passes” just one of these tests. The tests should instead be treated as factors that the ATO takes into account in assessing whether the PAYG system should apply, where a taxpayer applies for a determination ... even then we believe these tests should be tightened up. ·	</para></quote><para>It is clear that the alienation of personal services measures developed by the government will not address avoidance of taxation. The real challenge for the coalition government is to adopt the Ralph review's recommendation and to raise the standard of the alienation of personal services criteria so that the law will be effective. As it currently stands, this is a Clayton's law that the government has designed to be easily exempted from, and it will be of no benefit to either the national revenue or the contractors involved. It will ensure that the package of bills relating to business tax reform do not—and it cannot—meet the government's own critical test of revenue neutrality. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>15460</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Naturally, I listened with great interest to the speeches during the second reading debate.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—You would have known that the debate was finished if you had been listening.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—I was just finalising my research notes for my response, Senator. As usual, the speeches were patchy. There were some points made which were of interest. During the committee stage of the bill, we can deal in detail with a number of those issues. The <inline ref="R1060">New Business Tax System (Alienation of Personal Services Income) Bill 2000</inline> is one of a number of business tax bills that the government has introduced into the parliament to implement its broad-ranging business tax reform. The government is implementing these business tax reforms following 12 months of extensive consultation with the business community through the review of business tax, headed by John Ralph.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is worth putting on record the remarkable work done by the Ralph committee. Certainly from my experience, it was a quite unique process of consultation with the business community. There has always been debate in the business community, which I think in recent years has perhaps reached a level of intensity that we have not seen before, about the need for greater consultation. Indeed, the Ralph committee delivered that consultation in a unique way. Mr Ralph has been given a lot of credit, very appropriately, for the chairmanship of that committee and for the very constructive and consultative way that the committee worked.</para><para>In many ways, the Ralph committee report was a landmark because not only has it led to a lot of changes which will be of great benefit to the tax system in this country in creating a more competitive tax system but it points to the way in which major reforms can be undertaken and the constructive role that the business community—and indeed other groups which were directly brought into the process—can play. After a period of consultation, a report was produced which, I think, was very widely welcomed. There will be continuing debate on some of the recommendations, and option 2 is clearly one of those where there will be continuing debate. But the truth of the matter is that it was a remarkable effort and it produced a very wide range of reforms which this and related bills, in part, reflect. In September and November last year, the Treasurer announced the government's response to the recommendations of the review, and since then there have been further consultations with business on the implementation details of these measures, as foreshadowed in September.</para><para>To summarise, the government's business tax reforms contain a broad range of measures, including a number of integrity measures—some of which have already been legislated—and including the one we are debating here today. The government has already, for example, legislated important measures preventing loss duplication and preventing value shifting through debt forgiveness and the taxation of consideration received from the signing of leases. As part of its business tax reforms the government has also already legislated significant cuts in company tax and capital gains tax rates which will give Australia an internationally competitive business tax system. The government has also introduced scrip for scrip rollover relief and additional rollover relief and exemptions from capital gains tax for small business. These business tax reforms complement the broader reforms that the government has introduced, such as cuts in personal income tax rates, changes to family assistance and reform of Commonwealth-state relations and indirect taxation reform. ·	</para><para>The bills being debated today implement an important business tax measure that will improve the fairness of the tax system. The measures in these bills are based on the recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation. The bills will prevent individuals reducing their tax by diverting the income generated by their personal services to a company, partnership or trust, or limit work related deductions available in those cases, and to an individual contractor in similar circumstances. The provisions of these bills will apply where individuals and enterprise entities receive at least 80 per cent of their personal services income from one source, unless the commissioner makes a determination that the income is from conducting a personal services business. </para><para>To recap, the commissioner may make such a determination on one of four grounds: firstly, having two or more unrelated clients; secondly, having one or more employees; thirdly, having separate business premises; or, fourthly, the individual or entity is producing a result, supplies their tools of trade and is liable for the cost of rectifying defective work. The government has also included in the bills a specific transitional provision to minimise the compliance burden associated with moving to the new tax system. Under this transitional provision, the Commissioner for Taxation will be able to make a declaration that has the effect that the regime will not apply to a class of contractors under the prescribed payments system who have payee declarations with the commission as of 30 April 2000, the day the bills were introduced. The declaration will apply for a period of two years, ending 30 June 2002.</para><para>In designing this transitional provision the government has had regard to the fact that payers under the prescribed payment system are currently subject to withholding arrangements and are specifically recognised as independent contractors under the tax laws. The government has also had regard to the logistics of the commissioner being able to process a potentially large number of requests for individual determinations for the 2000-01 income year. The transitional arrangement will remove any additional compliance burden from the new rules that independent contractors currently in a prescribed payment system face in transferring to the new tax system.</para><para>There were a number of specific issues raised by senators during the debate. I would note that the bills deal only with issues of taxation, and so I suggest that I deal with these matters as they arise in the committee stage of the bills. I would also like to record that the contributions from senators, typically in this case, were patchy.

Those who are the authors of this flat, regressive tax should stop for a moment and contemplate—because oh, what a terrible web they weave! This bill is that one that enables the appropriations to be added to, in order that government departments pay the GST. It is a necessary piece of legislation from that point of view. It raises a series of technical matters, some of which I would like to deal with in a moment; but the basic reason for this somewhat circuitous piece of legislation is that we have a GST and, in looking at the application of that tax, the requirements put on government departments, agencies and instrumentalities mean that we have to take with one hand and give with another—or vice versa, according to the circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>The second thing I want to say before I turn to my substantive remarks is that there is, as Senator Harradine indicated in an intervention a few moments ago, a somewhat jerky management of the program. We have had a piece of legislation just complete its second reading stage, but the government has delayed the consideration of the committeestage of that legislation—on the alienation of personal income, an important part of the business tax reform package—because it is not convenient to go on. This follows part of the GST package being deferred the other day as well, when we were in a position to proceed with it. The program is being jerked around at a moment's notice to suit what is happening offstage. Offstage, what is happening has just been revealed in a press conference by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees; and that is because the government has been hiding a report on the impact of the GST on caravan parks and boarding house rental accommodation. This report was leaked to the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program, to the interviewer Laurie Oakes, and disclosed a couple of nights ago. ·	</para><para>It is now clear that the government's undertaking to the Australian community about the impact of the GST on caravan park rentals and on boarding house rentals has been understated. Their promise was that it would go up by 1.9 per cent, but it has been revealed by the government's own report, which has now been leaked, that it will in fact go up by at least five per cent. Those people living on the margins in Australia, dependent on residency in caravan parks and boarding houses—and quite a huge number of Australians are, thanks to the attitude of this government, in such a situation—will have imposed on them new and unexpected charges that they were led to believe, prior to the election, would not occur. We know that the Democrats had asked for this report but we know as well that they never followed up on it, and they are now trying to resurrect the situation. The press conference that has, I understand, just concluded has led to an announcement by the Democrats that they will seek some compensatory amendments for the impact of the higher charges, and we will shortly no doubt see in this chamber a debate about that.</para><para>My point in raising this matter is not to have that debate now—because we will certainly join it when it comes on—but simply to make the point that the program in this chamber has been jerked around at the caprice of the government and the Democrats—who offstage have been manoeuvring to cover their embarrassment about the impact of the GST on ordinary Australians living in caravans and boarding houses—and that the Senate is not being provided with an opportunity to sequentially consider some of this legislation. We are being made the caprice of side deals offstage. That does interrupt the program, and it is important to make the point now lest, later on, someone says that the program is delayed. Let the finger be pointed at those who have jerked the program around: the government and the Australian Democrats.</para><para>I now turn to the legislation before us. As I said in my introductory remarks, this is one of those weird pieces of legislation necessitated by virtue of the GST. Let me address it by quoting, from the explanatory memorandum, the outline of this bill. The explanatory memorandum says:</para><quote><para>The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate moneys to Commonwealth entities to meet certain payments arising from the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).</para><para>The appropriation will apply only where the Commonwealth can recover the amount of the payment as an input tax credit (recoverable GST) under the GST law.</para><para>The amounts of appropriation shown in the Appropriation Bills 2000-2001 do not include an allowance for recoverable GST. The figures represent the net amount that Parliament is asked to allocate for particular purposes. This approach is in line with the accepted accounting practice for GST, which specifies that revenues, expenses and assets are to be recognised net of the amount of recoverable GST.</para><para>Consequently, additional appropriation is required to cover the following payments that give rise to recoverable GST:</para><para>.	payments to suppliers to the extent of the GST embedded in the acquisition price; and</para><para>.	payments of GST on creditable importations.</para></quote><para>That is the basic outline of the bill. The bill certainly does reflect exactly what the explanatory memorandum has described. It is important to note as well that the financial impact of this legislation is described thus:</para><quote><para>The additional appropriation will have no effect on recorded revenues, expenses and assets. It will not have any impact on the cash or Fiscal Budget balances.</para><para>Some agencies may find it necessary to draw, for a short time, on bridging finance that is available under current agency banking arrangements in order to address the cash flow effects of the GST on departmental expenditures.</para></quote><para>So there will be a cost in the form of bridging finance, a cost not quantified in the explanatory memorandum. I foreshadow now that that might be an issue, uncontroversial though it is, that in the committee stage of this legislation we will be asking the government to provide a figure on. We would like to know what the estimate is of the financial impact of this legislation in view of the fact that under the financial impact requirement no figure is given—although it is pointed to that a cost will be incurred. We would simply like to know in the public interest what that cost will be. ·	</para><para>This bill only arises because of the GST, and in layman's language what it is doing here is ensuring that government departments will have to pay the GST in certain circumstances. We are allocating funds to them so that they can do that and pay the GST back to the government, and this looks just like a book entry. The bill has chosen to do this as a special appropriation. In order to check what the precedent for this type of action is and what, in parliamentary terms, the proper explanation of this process might be and to assess the impact procedurally, I turn to the eighth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Under the heading `Indefinite appropriation proposed: new section 30(a)', the report, in referring to this bill, states:</para><quote><para>Schedule 1 of this bill proposes to insert a new clause—</para></quote><para>I will skip all of the introductory descriptive parts and pick up the statement as follows:</para><quote><para>However, proposed new section 30(a) limits the amount of any increase to the total of the GST qualifying amount for any acquisition or importation.</para></quote><para>The memorandum notes that this appropriation will apply only where the Commonwealth can recover these amounts, and it goes on:</para><quote><para>Therefore, this particular additional appropriation, though indefinite and arguably not subject to separate parliamentary scrutiny—</para></quote><para>and I would emphasise those words—</para><quote><para>is akin to a book entry which notes that a GST amount is payable and then recoverable.</para></quote><para>It is the emphasis that I placed here that I wanted to draw the Senate's attention to. By agreeing to this bill, we are providing an `indefinite' appropriation—not one that we would claw back into this chamber and make accountable—that is `arguably not subject' to the parliamentary scrutiny which follows, of course, the indefinite nature of this legislation. My office, in order to tie down the precedent and the nature of this, asked for an opinion from the Clerk of the Senate. I have before me a letter he wrote to my adviser in this field, Mr Jody Fassina, who is an excellent adviser indeed. I wish to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the remarks of the Clerk on this legislation. His response, headed `Financial Management and Accountability Bill 2000', states:</para><quote><para>You asked for a note on this bill.</para><para>The bill would insert a new section into the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> to increase every annual and standing appropriation under every act of the Commonwealth parliament by the amount necessary to fund payment of the GST by the Commonwealth departments and agencies which are authorised to spend money by those acts. The bill is therefore an appropriation bill, in that it would appropriate money to add to existing appropriations.</para><para>As the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill explains, the addition to the appropriations would not result in an increase in actual expenditure because the GST applies only notionally to Commonwealth departments and agencies, and the amounts they pay as GST will be recovered through input tax credits.</para></quote><para>I want to particularly draw the chamber's attention to the next two paragraphs:</para><quote><para>It is not unusual for the Parliament to pass standing appropriations, that is, appropriations which continue as long as the relevant act of Parliament remains in force, and most standing appropriations are of indefinite amount, in that the act says only that funds are appropriated to the extent necessary to meet a particular commitment. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> contains provisions which add to existing appropriations: section 28 appropriates money for the purpose of repayments by the Commonwealth which are required by any other act or law.</para><para>This bill, however, is unusual, and I believe unprecedented, in that it would add an indefinite amount to <inline font-style="italic">every</inline>—</para></quote><para>that word is emphasised—</para><quote><para>annual and standing appropriation in effect. Moreover, this would be an extraordinary kind of appropriation, in that it would not involve actual expenditure, but would be purely a `bookkeeping' device. ·	</para></quote><para>It is important to have that opinion on the record so it is clear that we know what is being done here. From the point of view of the opposition, it delivers to us a dilemma. The dilemma is: should we require this legislation to be periodically presented to us with the appropriation bills in the normal time to ensure that the purpose of parliamentary scrutiny is served and the accountability of the government is met or should we agree to an open-ended appropriation knowing that in so doing we create a precedent and one that we would be loathe to have visited in any other conceivable set of circumstances on the processes of the parliament? We balance those considerations against the consideration that this government tax clearly imposes on those departments and agencies an onerous responsibility for them to meet it. If the bill did not carry, they would be debited on their normal appropriations by the amount that this bill will enable them to pay—and after all it is only a book entry.</para><para>The approach the opposition have taken to the government's handling of the GST is noteworthy in terms of our approach to how we should deal with this legislation. Our approach has been to fight tooth and nail to prevent the GST from being introduced. It is a matter of record that that is what we have done; it is a matter of record that the Labor Party are opposed to the GST. It is also a matter of record that, of late, government ministers have stood up in this chamber and said that the Labor Party support a GST. Coming from a most unreliable source, that is hardly a credible statement and, coming from the authors of the GST, is something that hardly anyone pays any attention to. It is also the case that, whenever that fatuous and facile allegation has been made, we have disowned it because it is not our position. Funnily enough, we think that the Labor Party speak for the Labor Party, not the Liberal Party. This is just the Liberal Party trying to shift the blame onto us for the type of tax that is being introduced. Emphatically, yet again—underlined, in italics, raised into bold print and blackened—we say: we are opposed to the GST. Now let us put that issue aside.</para><para>What we have done, though, having tried to prevent the introduction of this tax, is that we have enabled the processes that underpin it to be the government's. We have supported government legislation on how they will go about collecting this tax and how they will go about offsetting the regressive nature of this tax. As a consequence, we have supported the measures for pensioners, tax cuts and a range of other things as well. We have done that quite deliberately and for a reason. If we cannot defeat this tax, we want it to be the tax the government want so that when the Australian community is called to the ballot box, whenever that is, and a judgment is to be passed on the government, the government cannot say to the Labor Party, `You made us do certain things that caused this tax to be other than what we wanted.' So this is the government tax as they asked for it, replete with all the details they sought. Of course, the government's defence will be that they did a deal with the Australian Democrats which changed the nature of what they originally asked for. It is true; they did. And it is true that it did change the nature of what they originally asked for. But they agreed to it; it was, after all, an agreement. By agreeing, they have to accept the responsibility for the dog's breakfast that is going to be imposed, in a few days time, on the Australian community. Taking all that into consideration, it is appropriate for us in these circumstances to support the necessary remedial legislation, although it is unusual, although it is open-ended and although it creates a precedent, so that government departments and/or agencies that are met with a bill because of this tax will not be disadvantaged. It would be unfair of us to handicap them, if that were to be the case, in any way.</para><para>I will return to the Clerk's advice. We have a high regard for the office of the Clerk of the Senate and for the impartial advice that that office from time to time provides to this chamber. It is not always the case that we necessarily agree with that advice, and it would be inappropriate for me to pretend that we do. This is often an area that is heartily contested. But what he says here is confirmed not just by him—which would be a weighty enough argument on its own for this chamber to sit up and take notice—but also by what is in the explanatory memorandum produced to accompany this bill. If anyone wanted to take issue with what the Clerk has said, they would have a mighty difficult task to argue him down. We do not take issue; we think he is absolutely spot-on—right on the money. We support the views and the warning that he has given to this chamber in his letter. I want to emphasise that warning: this is open-ended, it is unprecedented and it is on account of the GST. We will not be opposing this legislation, but I want to mark in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the spot where we have raised these considerations, reflected the Clerk's advice and clearly put before the chamber—and in the mind of the chamber—the nature of this precedent so that it is not repeated on any other occasion and that we are only moving to this position because of the GST. If we can roll back the GST to cover this point at some future time when we get our hands on the Treasury books, we will obviate this precedent as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>·	</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15466</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1068">Financial Management and Accountability Amendment Bill 2000</inline>, while technical in nature, is a very important piece of legislation. My colleague Senator Cook has touched on the subject matter. This legislation does provide for an indefinite—I stress the description `indefinite'—provision for the assessment of GST on Commonwealth government departments. It is the first time that any tax legislation has been dealt with in this way. That is understandable because it is the first time this country has had a goods and services tax—a massive new tax on just about everything in the Australian community, whether it is a good or a service. The GST, being an extraordinarily massive new tax imposed on the Australian community, requires some fairly extraordinary treatment to cover its impact on government departments—in this case we are dealing with Commonwealth departments. In respect of the treatment of government departments, we are still to receive a detailed response from Treasury about the way in which the GST impact will be treated at a state government department level. A number of Labor senators, including me, pursued this issue recently at estimates. While we were obviously asking Commonwealth Treasury officials and Commonwealth finance department officials about what relates to a state government matter, it is still highly relevant to ask, in the context of the impact of a GST, how it will be dealt with at a state level, and I look forward with interest to a response to those questions.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation provides further confirmation that the GST is a federal government tax. In the budget papers, there is an attempt—and I think it is a very half-hearted attempt, frankly—to maintain that the GST is not a Commonwealth government tax. Again, this was the subject of some intensive questioning at the Senate estimates committee hearings because Treasurer Costello, the Prime Minister and various members of the Liberal-National parties in government have attempted to maintain the fiction that the GST is in fact a state tax. Of course, this is an absolutely absurd position to be taking. I do not think many people in the Australian community seriously believe that the GST is a state tax. The revenue will be given to the states; however, the goods and services tax in this country is being implemented under a Commonwealth head of power. It has nothing to do with state tax laws whatsoever. If we want further evidence that this is a Commonwealth tax and not a state tax, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is an impartial judge in this area, has referred to it and classified it as a Commonwealth tax, not a state tax. Of course, the legislation we are considering here, whilst technical in nature and important in terms of the way in which Commonwealth departments will be treated, does provide further evidence that this is a Commonwealth tax, not a state tax. I think it is important to make those points because the government still tries to maintain a fiction in this area. As I said, it is not an overly important issue because, frankly, no-one in the general community or the business community believes that this tax is being imposed by state governments.</para><para>Senator Cook has made some comment about the program. The program has been shifted around significantly in the last few days when we have been dealing with GST related matters, and the Labor opposition, as usual, are being cooperative. The government has its program. We may not agree with the goods and services tax. However, the government does have the right to deal with legislation on a day-to-day basis as it sees fit. However, as I have noted previously, we are dealing with continual roll-backs of the goods and services tax in a wide range of areas. We are being hit with amendment after amendment and page after page. I think there are well over 1,000 amendments to the government's original GST legislation, and we will shortly receive another amendment. It is not being presented to this legislation; it will obviously be presented to some other GST legislation. That amendment will go to the very important issue of the impact of the GST on boarding houses and caravan park rentals. ·	</para><para>There has been a great deal of public comment about this. We know that for the last five months—and I am glad Senator Newman is in the chamber as the minister responsible in this area—Senator Newman and the Treasurer have refused to publicly release the very important report by Econtech that was commissioned in this area to assess the impact of the GST on rents in the general community. It was discovered that the government's prediction that rents would increase by a little over two per cent, depending on the circumstances, was in fact totally incorrect and that rents will increase by more than double the initial government claim. They will increase at an average of about 4.7 per cent, perhaps higher, depending on individual circumstances. Senator Newman, Senator Kemp, Mr Costello and the Prime Minister sat on this report for approximately five months. They refused to release it until part of it was leaked to Laurie Oakes, the well-known journalist. The government sat on this report and were finally forced to release the report. The government's secret report showed that rents in this country were going to be double what the government were initially claiming they would be.</para><para>There has been a great deal of public comment about this. I understand that a press conference was held a short time ago by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees. She announced that a deal had been reached with the government to increase rental assistance from seven per cent to 10 per cent. This is currently being analysed in some detail. My understanding is that it will not have a significant impact in ameliorating the disastrous effect of the GST on rents for people in caravan parks and boarding houses. It will probably be worth only $1 or $1.50 a week to some of the people who will be hurt by the GST in this area. But it is significant also that the government—Senator Newman, earlier this week; Senator Kemp; the Treasurer, Mr Costello; and the Prime Minister—said that they would not change the government approach to the GST in this area. They have now done a backflip—and not because of the National Party. The poor old National Party has become irrelevant because of some pressure from the Democrats and the Labor Party.

I note the Treasurer himself did not front the press conference; he would have had to answer some fairly embarrassing questions about why they have done a partial backflip in this particular area. This is yet another backflip in a series of very important backflips on the GST. ·	</para></talk.start><para>A few remarks should be made about the approach of the Australian Democrats to this matter. We have a GST because it is the policy of the Liberal-National parties. They have pushed this matter continuously since the election and since the infamous backflip on the `never ever' commitment given by the Prime Minister. We have a GST also because the Australian Democrats did a deal with the Liberal-National parties—and, when it suits the Treasurer, he blames the Democrats for the fallout from some of the consequences of that deal, whether it is in respect of food or in respect of rents. But the Australian Democrats have discovered the issue of rents. My colleague in the other place, our frontbench spokesperson in this area, Mr Swan, has made many quite correct comments about the impact of the GST on rents. On a number of occasions, he has called for the public release of the government's secret report that they have tried to keep buried for the last five months. The assiduous work of Mr Swan and other members of the Labor Party brought this issue to the public's attention. Then the Australian Democrats, who signed up to the deal on the GST, jumped on the bandwagon at the last moment, as they did with the taxation treatment of beer.</para><para>The poor old National Party have kicked and screamed over this issue over the last fortnight. We know what happened at their conference. The poor old National Party have pleaded at various times, publicly and privately, with the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to change position in respect of the treatment of rents on caravan parks and boarding houses. But who listens to the National Party in this government? They do not count; they do not matter. It has come down to the Australian Democrats—albeit in a fairly minor way—to get the government to do a backflip, yet again, on another important aspect of the implementation of the GST at an incredibly late hour. We have only a few days until the implementation of the GST.</para><para>Senator Newman was here earlier. I had invited her to give the Senate an explanation of the public announcement that was made this morning by Senator Lees. Senator Newman has defended the impact of the GST on rents. She has defended it on a number of occasions in this chamber, and she had a duty—not just to the Senate but to the public of Australia—to give us some sort of explanation while she was in here and while we were debating important GST legislation to explain why this backflip occurred. Regrettably, she failed to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>15468</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1068">Financial Management and Accountability Amendment Bill 2000</inline> is technical in nature and its details have been outlined in the second reading speech. I will not go over the details, other than to say that the bill accommodates the fact that the Commonwealth, like other entities, will be paying the GST. We need to have an appropriation which accounts for the amount of GST which is payable and recoverable. In that, there is no great moment, mystery or magic, despite what the opposition would have the Australian community believe.</para></talk.start><para>I might briefly address the point raised by Senator Cook when he referred to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's eighth report of the year 2000. Senator Cook did not state that a letter from the Minister for Finance and Administration comprehensively—and I use the term of the committee when I use that word; I use that word because I intend to, because it was a comprehensive reply by the minister for finance—addressed the two queries raised by the committee. On the indefinite nature of the appropriation created by the bill, Minister Fahey quite correctly pointed out that many appropriations are indefinite as to amount in the sense that the amount appropriated in any given year can be determined only in retrospect.</para><para>A vivid and common example is the standing appropriation which relates to social security. In any year, you cannot forecast how many claimants there will be for a particular government benefit, so you set aside a standing appropriation, which is not finite—it does not have a specific figure. When the financial year has passed, you are then able to work out exactly what was paid out. At the start of that year, you would not be able to estimate with precision how many claimants there would be. That is an example of a longstanding indefinite appropriation. There are other appropriations which are open-ended as to amount, but the nature of the expenditure is tightly controlled—for example, the appropriation to the Commissioner of Taxation for the making of refunds. Who is to know in any given year how much in refunds will be paid to Australian taxpayers? The indefinite nature of the appropriation is by no means unprecedented. In fact, it enjoys quite common practice in the system of Australian government over a period of time. ·	</para><para>The other matter which was dealt with in Minister Fahey's letter was the question of scrutiny by parliament. This issue was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which does a very good job. As a former member, I can vouch for the excellent job it does in looking at the legislation before the parliament. Minister Fahey states that the bill does not diminish the extent of any scrutiny by parliament. The appropriations in the bill are very similar to appropriations which have been established under sections in annual appropriation acts in respect of net appropriations. I quote Minister Fahey:</para><quote><para>As in the appropriation under scrutiny, each of these appropriation supplements are basic appropriations to the extent of receipts of a specified character.</para></quote><para>What Minister Fahey is saying is that this appropriation enjoys the same scrutiny as any other appropriation. Indeed, at the estimates committees, of which we have just had lengthy sittings, questions can be asked easily by the opposition in relation to amounts which have been appropriated in relation to these matters. So it is not a question of there being some indefinite figure, a mysterious figure, which will remain so in relation to the appropriation of moneys; it is something which deals with the GST. When we come to supplementary estimates committee hearings, these figures can be obtained, just as any other figure can be obtained in relation to any other indefinite appropriation.</para><para>This amendment to the bill is essential because it provides for section 83 of the Constitution to be followed so that amounts spent must be appropriated for. That is in the system of our government, and not to do that would be inappropriate. Also, for accounting purposes, it provides for an appropriation for these GST amounts which can be recovered.</para><para>Perhaps I can just add that the amounts which are in the budget and to which we refer in everyday business are net amounts, and they are exclusive of the GST which has been paid. They are, in fact, the real cost, if you like, to the taxpayer or to the government. It makes sense that, in dealing with figures, we provide net figures exclusive of the GST. That is why you have those net figures provided for in the budget context.</para><para>I note that the opposition will not oppose this bill. But if the opposition gets into government—and it may get into government one day, although that is a very big `if'—I note that it will be keeping this bill because it will be keeping the GST. It has not said that whenever, if ever, it gets into government it will not be keeping the GST; it has merely said that it will roll it back. If the opposition rolls back the GST, that means it is going to keep it. If it is going to keep it, it means that it has to carry on the provisions of this very bill—and that is why the opposition is not opposing it today.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>15469</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the bill stand as printed.

But the bridging finance is something which applies to the internal working during the course of the financial year. It is not a question of having an extra cost over and above moneys appropriated for the department which would have to come out of the budget in further years; it is something which is dealt with internally within the department, and the bridging finance facilitates the department to meet that cost on a pro tem basis. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15470</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I understand that explanation, so let me ask you this question in more direct terms. Is the bridging finance provided from within the appropriations that the Senate has ticked off for the relevant department, or is it summoned up from the department of finance and given as a bridging amount in addition to the appropriations provided to the department? That is the question. It is obvious why I am asking it. If the funds are drawn from within the appropriation, then some other program within the department is set back, or not proceeded with and those funds that would have been used to do that are given to the servicing of the GST requirement on the department. If that is the case, then departments have not got the appropriations necessary in order to meet their commonly expected program needs.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15471</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The short answer is that it comes from appropriations made for the various departments. The supplementary part of Senator Cook's question dealt with the effect of that, if that was the case. Most departments have cash reserves that they have in place in any given year that they can draw on. There are a number of ways for departments to meet these costs. In fact, in any given year, some departments may well have discontinued programs which can give them some leeway in relation to that. There are a number of ways to  meet this without cutting back on programs. ·	</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15471</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to get at the financial impact of this, and it is still a little opaque, if I may say so. If the funds are drawn from within the department's appropriation, then it is a cost to the department in some form. The explanation is then that most departments or agencies have a reserve, which leaves open the question: what happens in the case of those departments or agencies that do not have a reserve? How many of them are there and how much do they have to dud their program expenditure in order to meet the GST costs? </para></talk.start><para>Sticking with the question of the departments that have a reserve, my understanding is—and I may require correction on this, so I mark the point—that those reserves maintained by departments are invested in some form, usually on the overnight money market or whatever, which is to say that those reserves earn income by virtue of their investment to the Commonwealth, either to the department or to the department of finance. To the extent that those reserves are not invested and deployed to meet the GST costs, the earning power of those reserves is reduced. So there is a cost, and it is not set out as to what it is. </para><para>Minister, it may be that this is—to use the colloquial—a suck it and see operation and it may be that this is an operation that varies according to the internal financial competence of various departments and how they manage their funds, or it may be that this is, in fact, able to be directly quantified. Will you confirm for me that for those departments and agencies that do not maintain a surplus there is a cost to their programs and that, for those that do, there is a cost by reducing the amount of earnings the surpluses would have attracted by virtue of their investment into some fund or earning capacity while they are waiting to be called up?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>15471</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In any year a department could expect its cash surpluses to be drawn upon for any number of reasons, and this is no different from that.

That is something which is allowed and that is a cash allowance from which a department could make a drawing.</para></talk.start><para>Leaving that aside, there are other ways that the department could meet these costs. It does not mean that you have to go out and cut a program. There may be a number of areas where, as I have said, there could be a discontinuance of a program which has been part of government policy, administration. There are a number of ways that savings can be made and have been made in various departments and agencies. But the area that would be of prime attention in this case would be the cash reserves. The government would not concede that programs would have to be cut back because of this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>15471</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I get a premonition that maybe I am not going to get an answer in dollar terms to my question. Let me persist one more time from a slightly different perspective. While it is true, as you have said, that departments can make savings in all sorts of ways, the examples you have offered are that maybe the government decides to discontinue a program or that the admi-nistration of a program might change—which I read as code for people losing their jobs and there being fewer people to do the same jobas before, and the savings are made by cutting staff numbers. ·	</para></talk.start><para>My understanding is that, in the case where those savings are made, the department of finance, rightly, rides pretty strongly over departments to make sure that a savings dividend is offered by departments annually as well and that there is a constant department of finance requirement over the departments to find savings in any case. But leaving all of that aside, what you have pointed to in your answer is that to the extent that cash reserves which have been invested are removed from investment and deployed to pay for the GST there is a loss of earnings on what the amount would have been of those funds that are now used for the GST. I will try one more time, Minister. Now that we have established there is a cost, can your advisers—who as I note in the advisers box are senior and competent members of the department of finance—provide us with a figure of what they expect the cost of this bridging finance will be. If they cannot provide us with that today, would you take it on notice and provide an answer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>15472</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will take that on notice. I can say that what Senator Cook is referring to is the question of a cash flow. I take it from the last question that the nub of the issue here is how the problem, if it is one, is to be borne by the department. What I am advised is that the tax commissioner will allow amounts received from the Australian Taxation Office to be offset against amounts owing to the Australian Taxation Office, such as withholding tax and salaries. So what you do is balance input tax credits against the tax you withheld on the payment of salaries for staff. When you weigh up the two, the difference is not anticipated to be great. In fact, it is the government's expectation that the cost to departments would be quite small. So on a cash flow basis it is not envisaged that this will be a burden.</para></talk.start><para>That then flows through to the question of how the various departments meet this. I think you have to look at the scale of the burden which we say will be small. That then takes away the concern of it coming from the cutting back of programs or anything of that sort. This is really not an issue which is going to impinge on the running of departments and agencies to the extent of cutting back programs. As to the extent of the figures involved, it is impossible to have any prognostication at this stage. It is something which we will take on notice.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>15472</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will conclude on this point: you say that the cost is small—the cost is not great—and that the burden is not great. I think that is what you said in that answer. My worry about this is that, when references of that type are made, it is a bit like my dentist, who leans over me with a pair of surgical pliers to extract a tooth and says, `This won't hurt a bit.' My experience in those circumstances has been that it hurts quite a lot. </para></talk.start><para>I do not know what `small' or `not great' or `not a burden' means in dollar terms. Because the GST is a highly controversial tax, and because government departments and agencies under this bill are required to pay it and there is a special appropriation for them, we would like to know what the full cost of levying this tax might be. Pardon our cynicism, but when we ask about the cost of it we get answers like, `It's not great,' or `It's quite small,' or `It's not a burden.' So that the Australian people really know how much they will have to cough up to meet this tax—and it is a question of the accountability of this government to this chamber and, through this chamber, to the community, who are concerned about it—it is reasonable to ask what the true cost is. The minister has indicated to me that it might not be possible to provide a figure, but he has indicated to me that he will answer my question on notice. I look forward to receiving, in that answer on notice, some sort of effort to quantify the amount. I indicate now that this is an issue that the opposition will follow through—as it seems there will be at least one more budget before the next federal election—in the estimates process in the future.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>15473</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 6) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15473</page.no><id.no>R1078</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15473</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 20 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15473</page.no><id.no>R1084</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15473</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>15473</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition support this bill, and the shadow minister for resources, my colleague Martin Evans in the other place, has explained why the government supports this bill.

I have to say that the opposition was dismayed by the level of mismanagement in relation to this bill. In fact, it was a complete dog's breakfast. It isn't now, but it was at that point when it first came on. The bill actually comes from the original bill, which was called the <inline ref="R961">Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>. The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 was, in fact, an omnibus bill which incorporated controversial and non-controversial elements. The omnibus nature of that bill obviously created some difficulties for us and, as I understand, led to a convention where, if possible, omnibus bills would be avoided. The reason that that convention arose was precisely because of what happened in relation to this bill, and I appreciate that a frontbencher would not be aware of it.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition was willing to support the practical amendments contained in the bill, but there were other controversial elements which could not be supported, thereby necessitating the break-up of the bill, which is what has happened now. At the point where this came to the Senate, the opposition did not make an offer to the government to break the bill up in order that this could be dealt with. What happened was that, as we were dealing with the bill, a whole set of amendments was circulated, virtually during the second reading stage of the bill. I do not wish to cast aspersions on this chamber, because I do understand it was a difficulty from a minister who is not in this chamber.</para><para>We had new amendments circulated half an hour prior to the bill coming on to deal with Australian National Railways in the wind-up, something which was not related, in fact, to the territories bill which was before us. There was a scramble as a result of that. We were happy to accept it, but we have processes that we had to go through in terms of consultation with the appropriate shadow minister. So what happened—and the government has now fixed it and I do appreciate that—is that there was a major difficulty causing an embarrassment all round, not simply in relation to the government. We were given very little time to consider them, and I have to say that we were not happy with the management of this bill in relation to the minister in the other chamber who deals with transport.  ·	</para><para>What we have got now is a bill that contains these additional amendments as well as the transport aspects of the omnibus bill. We support this bill. It is in relation to some technical matters that relate to the facilitating, the wind-up of AN. It has been supported by the House of Representatives and we will be supporting it, but we just wish to make the point that omnibus bills ought to be avoided where possible, and the opposition would like the government to convey to the minister in the other place that, as far as we are concerned, it makes it extremely difficult for us to agree to what are non-controversial matters if issues are placed before us at very short notice. As I said, this is not casting aspersions at all on Senator Macdonald—it was nothing to do with Senator Macdonald—but I do wish to say through Senator Macdonald to Minister Anderson that in future we could avoid a lot of unnecessary confusion on all sides if what has happened now had happened earlier. With those remarks, I indicate that we will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>15474</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Mackay for her comments and her support for this bill.

Regrettably, and I think I made this apology last time—again, it was not Mr Anderson's fault, but due to some administrative oversights thatoccasionally happen—there were some elements of this which were not advised to the opposition at the appropriate time. I think I have made that apology before, and I repeat it. I take on board again what Senator Mackay has said about consultation and involvement. </para></talk.start><para>As a government, we always want to make sure that both the opposition and, particularly, the Democrats, who we understand have limited resources, are fully briefed on issues that come before the chamber so that, even if they do not agree with the legislation, they do at least understand it.

Whilst an omnibus bill is very broad and wide and while it covers a lot of different bills and pieces of legislation, I have to say, again with the greatest of respect to the Democrats, that it is not really the avenue for dealing with mandatory sentencing. It is an important issue but it should not be dealt with here. </para><para>Where we are left now, of course, is that we still have the other bill halfway through this chamber. There are a couple of pieces of that that have raised some opposition. I am not sure whether it is opposition directly or otherwise; I have not quite caught up with the industrial relations element of that bill. That still has to come back along the line. Whether it is to be passed or not passed will depend upon the will of this chamber, but we still have to deal with that. Certainly the mandatory sentencing did not help with that bill. Hence, we have taken the appropriate way to get this time critical bill through—and that is what we are doing here today.

There are now more than nine million Australians in employment. Since we have been in government almost 700,000 new jobs have been created, with 381,000 being full time. If you go back over the last six years of Labor you find that they created less than half the number of jobs that we have created in our four years—that is, 300,000—and only about 10 per cent of those were full time. This is the crowd that always complain about casualisation and the like. They could not deliver on full-time jobs. The reason we have unemployment down to 6.7 per cent is that we have been able to tackle the fundamental economic challenges—we have brought inflation down, we have strong economic growth, we have lower interest rates, and we have reformed the industrial relations agenda. That is critical if you are serious about getting the unemployment rate down. </para></talk.start><para>What do we read about today? Labor are going to have another go at setting an unemployment target of five per cent. We all remember that that went down like a lead balloon at the last election because people knew they could not possibly deliver on it. How on earth can you say, `We're going to do better than you, but we are going to turn the clock back on all your initiatives'? You are going to go back and revisit all those failed and discredited employment projects where you basically paid people billions of dollars to sit on the sidelines. The failed make-work programs and training schemes did not get anyone into serious employment but just kept them amused basically and enabled you to pander to the unions, who usually had a role in administering them. That is the way they are going to turn the clock back. They are going to repeal the trade practices provisions in relation to secondary boycotts. Once again, that will be back in the industrial relations forum where it ceases to be a serious legal issue. No doubt, strike pay will be brought back as well. </para><para>Quite clearly, the Labor Party has this fundamental credibility problem. No-one for a moment believes that you would get anywhere near a target of five per cent. No wonder Beattie actually scrapped it not so long ago. He said it wasn't worth trying to aim for something as ambiguous as that. Of course, with Labor's policies you might as well double it if you are realistic about where things are likely to go. </para><para>Now we learn that the national executive meeting tomorrow is going to consider a draft blueprint. What is a draft blueprint? That is what you have before you have an interim provisional document—in other words, a policy discussion. You go on with all these iterations and you, unfortunately, just do not quite get around to having a policy before the next election; you just have a series of vague promises, a few feel good statements, something that you hope will fool the punters into thinking that you are serious about economic reform when we know you are not.  ·	</para><para>If you really want to know where Labor is going on industrial relations reform, you have to look at what the hard men in the unions are saying. They are salivating. They cannot wait to get another crack to impose their wishes on the Labor Party. Craig Johnston boasted recently that he had had more than 200 orders issued against him by the Industrial Relations Commission. This is the bloke who is represented in the Senate by Senator George Campbell, I might say. He is also under pressure for rigging ballots. You never hear any criticism of that at all. What you do know is that in order to pay the fines imposed on blokes like Mighell and Johnston you are now going to have employers forced to attend a $500 a head fundraising gesture. What does the Trades Hall Council secretary say? He says, `$500 would be a pretty small price to pay for industrial peace.' Once again, we are back to these very grubby protection rackets. We are back to the unions dominating industrial reform, or non-reform.

So that is great news for Tasmania, Senator Watson, and as a great Tasmanian you will be very pleased to hear that. But there is much better news. The Labor Party's tax policy is 12 per cent, 22 per cent and 32 per cent on a wide range of goods. Under the Liberal-National coalition, we are getting rid of all those taxes—the 12 per cent, the 22 per cent and the 32 per cent. </para></talk.start><para>For rail, on which rural and regional communities rely very heavily to transport goods, the diesel fuel excise will be completely wiped out—35c a litre cheaper. For marine, as I have mentioned—and Senator Watson, in particular, will be pleased—the diesel fuel excise will be gone completely. For road, the cost of fuel for transport will go down by 24c litre. Labor put it up from 8c to 44c a litre; we are bringing the diesel fuel excise down by 24c a litre. As for the tax on trucks themselves, on tyres and spare parts—there are a couple of senators representing the Transport Workers Union: Senator Conroy is one and Senator Hutchins is another and I know that when Senator Hutchins and Senator Conroy were driving trucks they would have understood what the wholesale sales tax was. You can just imagine Senator Conroy driving a truck. Senator Conroy, if you ever get near a truck, the way it goes is the sort of pointy end. Senator Hutchins would know that but I doubt that Senator Conroy would. The 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on trucks will go and 22 per cent will come off tyres. And for rural and regional residents in those communities $4 billion will come off the cost of exports. </para><para>What was Labor's policy? Of course they have no policy at all. Their spokesman here, Senator Mackay, said at estimates that they will tell us about their regional policy—but after the next election. Perhaps, as well as Country Labor running a competition for the name of their newsletter, we could run a competition on some policies that Labor might have for country Australians. I will donate two Keating inspirational videos if anyone can tell me a Labor policy for country Australia up to 31 December. Second prize will be no Keating videos, so that is the better prize. There are no policies from Labor on rural and regional Australia, so let us go by their past actions. Tax on transport fuel: under the Liberal-National proposal, it will go down 24c; under Labor it went up from 7c to 44c. Diesel fuel on marine things and rail: under Labor it was 35c a litre; under the Liberal-National proposal, it will be absolutely nothing.

I would have hoped that the Brotherhood of St Laurence would understand how free with the truth the Labor Party can be and would have done their own research into the funding of child care. It is not true that this government has cut $850 million out of child care, or any sum. Every year we have allocated more money for child care than the Labor Party ever did. In the last four years we have spent something like $5 billion on child care, which is considerably more than the Labor Party spent in the last four years when they were in government. Let us get those facts on the table. But it does not seem to matter what the facts are because the Labor Party keep trotting out this tired, old, untrue statement year after year.

I remind the Senate that it is very much focused on reports of a $16 increase in fees. Let me remind the Senate that fees are not, and never have been, set by federal governments. They are very heavily dependent upon a number of things, as is any small business, such as changes in the market, interest rates, industrial relations issues and also the costs imposed on them by state governments in terms of workers compensation. I know in my home state of Tasmania there is a very heavy burden of workers compensation on child-care centres. It would be a really great start if the Labor government in Tasmania did something about the high cost of workers compensation burden on both child-care centres and aged care institutions.</para><para>The rate of fee increases for child care in Australia has halved under this government.

I hope that the Brotherhood of St Laurence would be able to differentiate between the high cost of child care under the previous administration and the lesser rate of growth in child-care costs under this government.</para><para>Of course, come 1 July, there will be substantial improvements in the assistance given to families, on the basis of both the extra $7.50 per child and the higher benefit rate, the 10 per cent increase, for part-time care, which, for many families, is the preferred type of care that they want to access now because many parents are trying to combine work and family in a way that allows them to spend more time with their children. That means they are more in the market for part-time care than they were in the past. Under Labor's high interest rates, both parents were forced to be full time in the work force in order to keep the roof over their heads. They are some of the things I am saying to the people of Australia and to the Labor Party, who are quite unable to accept the fact that we have inherited the results of their profligacy.

The government will be promoting him in a contest which will be difficult, which is the last point that Senator Bourne touched upon. There are 21 candidates for just nine vacancies but, nevertheless, as Australia's candidate, we will be doing our best to have Professor Shearer elected.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15481</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

In relation to the Kalejs situation and the extradition treaty with Latvia, I do understand that negotiations on a draft text of an extradition treaty were completed on 25 April this year, with the aim of finalising that by the end of July. After that, each country will have to submit a signed treaty to its parliamentary approval processes.

Latvia could make a request, I might say, once charges have been laid, but Australia would need a legal basis in order to grant extradition. If a request is received before the treaty enters into force, we would consider applying the extradition act to Latvia on a nontreaty basis to allow the request to be dealt with. That, I think, deals with the aspect of Senator Greig's question in relation to Mr Kalejs and any possible extradition to Latvia, and also in relation to the situation relating to the proposed treaty with Latvia.

Interestingly enough, the last time this particular feat was achieved was not by the Keating government or the Hawke government; it was achieved between 1968 and 1971. It is a massive achievement. In other words, the economic management of the coalition government was made possible by a period of sustainably high growth in a low inflationary environment.

Senator, you have many crosses against your name, but on that particular issue—your honesty—you get a tick for pointing out the shocking performance of former Labor governments in relation to real wages. Yesterday we received further evidence that the Australian economy is continuing to grow strongly. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity for April has been revised upwards. The index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity six to nine months into the future, grew by about 4.2 per cent in the year to April. The press release notes the stunning 7.2 per cent surge in real profits. At the same time, we have seen other signs in the economy of how well it is growing. We have good news on virtually every economic front. I am sorry that the faces over there are so sombre and so sad, but let me just take you through the good news. I know that this depresses you, Senator Sherry, but let me take you through it: wages are rising, unemployment is falling, inflation remains low, growth is at record levels, household income is up, industrial production is up, real unit labour costs are down and profits are strong.

I asked: why is it that Telstra is valued at close to zero in the budget when its value is estimated to be around $90 billion, why was the G3 mobile phone spectrum included as an asset and not other parts of the spectrum and how was the G3 spectrum estimate of $2.6 billion calculated? These are questions that are critical to the budget, given that the budget surplus was dependent on the $2.6 billion for the sale of the spectrum. Even since the budget, there have been various reports about whether or not that is a realistic estimate, whether it should be much higher or whether it should, in fact, be much lower than that and whether the existing telecommunications carriers in this country will need to purchase spectrum at all. Given the speculative nature of the spectrum sale, it seems to me to have been a very important question which ought to have been answered well and truly by now.

Senator Cook's question drew out the fundamental political lie that this government has been peddling throughout its propaganda campaign to try to persuade Australians that the GST is fundamentally a good thing for them. We have now seen the government spend some $431 million promoting and advertising a most unpopular tax. We have seen as much as 12 times the amount of money spent selling this unpopular tax as is being offered to caravan residents and boarding house residents in the way of compensation. We are seeing extraordinary sums of money being devoted to this propaganda effort. The fundamental lie that this government is peddling is that there will be a reduction in tax when we all know that the government is actually proposing a whole series of new indirect taxes which will see the raising of some $24 billion. On the one hand, the government proposes to offer people $12 billion in tax cuts but, on the other hand, it fails to point out that it is raising $24 billion by way of indirect taxes.</para><para>The government has also failed to point out in this great political lie that most of the so-called benefits of these tax cuts will soon evaporate insofar as we will see a whole range of price rises, which will lead to quite significant inflation across the country. That will in turn see a rise in income as people chase those price rises and a whole series of bracket creeps, which will essentially wipe out the tax cut arrangements that the government is now proposing with regard to its income tax policy as distinct from its indirect tax policy. We have noticed that, just two weeks ago, some informed source, some inspired leak from this government, managed to put on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> a proposition that this government was seeking to develop a $20 billion war chest for the next election, which of course would essentially be made up of increased revenues that it would be able to secure through various means and of course would allow, as a result of the new taxation arrangements, a massive increase in the capacity of the government to deliver various bribes in the way of re-election policies. ·	</para><para>I think we therefore have to understand that the full package—and this government constantly seeks that we do this—ought to be measured properly. The $12 billion in tax cuts that the government talks of have to be measured against the $24 billion in increased revenue that it is raising as a result of indirect tax increases as a result of the GST. Of course, it is understood that all the GST revenue will allegedly be flowing back to the states. I would like to see exactly how much of that will in fact flow back to the states and how much of that money will come back to the Commonwealth as a result of the various clawback mechanisms now being proposed by this government in the way of general assistance grants to the states.</para><para>I think the general public, however, understands the fundamental lie of these new taxation arrangements because they know that many of the things that they are asked to pay for on a daily basis will increase in cost. This is the fundamental unfairness of the GST. It particularly strikes low income earners. It particularly strikes people with large families. Large low income families are particularly disadvantaged by this tax, especially if they are young families, because young children require significant expenditure. This situation is of course often accompanied by significant movements out of the work force so that income to families declines. We also see that people in regional and remote areas are likely to face increased expenses as a result of increased transport costs. People have been told that their education expenses will remain GST free, but that is not the case. We see, for instance, that school uniforms, bus and tram fares, stationery, various food required at school tuckshops, music lessons, musical instruments, coaching and extra classes and all those sorts of expenses will attract the GST. Much of what we are told about this new taxation system is built upon a fundamental lie. The fundamental lie is that Australians will be better off, when Australians know that that is not the case, particularly low income earners and particularly people in rural and regional parts of this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>15490</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this motion.

Let us go back to, say, 1985, the time of the tax summit. What did Graham Richardson say then? He said, `I have come to the conclusion, after wrestling with it for a long, long time, that if we do not move forward and go ahead with this tax reform package this government will forever be branded as weak and indecisive.' How right he was. For 13 years, the Australian Labor Party did not have the courage to move forward. They buckled in the face of union pressure in a most pathetic way, and now their entire political credibility, their political future, rests on the fact of scab lifting the goods and services tax.

In trying to convince the people that it is a fair and equitable tax, Mr Costello said on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>:</para><quote><para>No, no, this is one of these areas where you have to be very precise of the figures because you're talking about very small amounts. There are two issues here: one is boarding houses and caravan parks, and the other is private rents.</para></quote><para>Mr Peter Costello then explained how it is going to impact. He said:</para><quote><para>... indicated that rents would rise by 4.7 per cent over the long term. Now, 4.7 per cent on a $200 a week rent is, by my calculation $9.40—correct? What the government believes is that post the Senate changes the effect on a $200 rent would be around $7—it is a difference of about $2.40 out of a $200 rent.</para></quote><para>But he did not leave it there. He then said:</para><quote><para>No, no—</para></quote><para>in fact, the whole radio transcript is scattered with `No, no.' I think it is a reflection of what he feels about the GST—</para><quote><para>well, let me say why first of all I say it is $7.</para></quote><para>He tried to explain what the compensation package will be in response:</para><quote><para>And on the other side of the equation, a $50 a week income tax, and family increase, which will more than outweigh any price rises, is completely left out of the equation. ·	</para></quote><para>That is what he says: $50. But we heard Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, say today that it is $40 to $50. There has already been a shift in the margin down the track, so it is $40. If you go and have a look at the size of the GST package itself some 1,466 amendments later, it is 6.95 kilograms. It talks about electricity in terms of the average quarterly bill: householders on 4,450 kilowatt hours per year at 12 kilowatts per day, with a winter concession, which is now $152. Add from $13.70 to $14.45 to the householder's costs and already they have lost any increase.</para><para>If they have a gas bill as well, the average two-monthly billed household uses 9,470 megajoules bimonthly. Off-peak that is weighted now at $85, but after July add $7.65 to $8. These renters are not doing very well when you add just the electricity and the gas, but a family might have children and have to buy nappies. For toddlers weighing between 10 and 15 kilograms, nappies now cost $13.50, but add $1.16 to about $1.22. You already have more outlays and more increases that the average renters are going to have to face. All they get is statistics and figures from Mr Peter Costello to demonstrate to them that they are going to be better off. They do not believe that at all. Trying to convince people of that is going to be an uphill battle that you are not going to win. </para><para>Also on the impact, Telstra have decided to put up prices by 10 per cent—not, as Allan Fels suggested, a lot less than that. If you then look at the backflip—and speaking of the backflip, Mr Peter Costello is not even in the country, he has jetted off to Paris, he does not want to stay here in case there are more amendments that might add to it—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15492</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If the public of Australia thought this debate had degenerated into a doozey some time ago, today it has hit rock bottom.

Isn't it interesting to note that the Labour Party Prime Minister in New Zealand, Helen Clarke, has repeatedly said, even prior to the election, `What on earth is the Labor Party about in Australia, complaining about the fairest tax system in the world?' As my colleague Senator Mason said, it is interesting to note that the tax system which the Labor Party is rusted on to—the wholesale sales tax system—is common with only two countries, Botswana and Swaziland. What has happened? Even Botswana has decided to abandon the Labor Party, so the Labor Party has a tax policy in common with Swaziland. Congratulations!

That is the record, that is the way in which they should be judged and that is what we can look forward to in the future. This is a totally dishonest debate that is just going on and on and on.

That was as confusing as Senator Macdonald's answer today on GST-free marine things. God knows what GST-free marine things are. The mind boggles. It sounded a bit fishy to me. What I would like to talk about is the statements by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> yesterday morning when he was talking about people who pay a rental of $200. First off, he said that they would expect to pay a $7 increase on the $200, which is a 3.5 per cent increase in GST. Minutes later he betrayed himself and said, `These people will be paying from $8 to $10 extra a week. This extra $10 a week in rent is not going to affect these families because they will get an extra $50 as a result of the tax cuts.' For an average family, $50 is really not going to go very far. I wonder whether the Treasurer actually knows what he is talking about. He is floating around different price increases all the time.</para></talk.start><para>The government originally told the public that rents would rise by 2.3 per cent. Econtech, the federal government's preferred economic modeller, has predicted that rents will go up by twice as much. On my calculations, a 2.3 per cent increase on a $200 rent is $4.60. That is nowhere near the $10 extra that it is said these people will have to pay. We are talking about two million householders in Australia who have to pay rent. Most of those are battlers and average families. An extra $10 a week is a hell of a lot of money to the average family. The government have hidden the Econtech report for six months. We on this side of the chamber wonder why. Are they hiding something? Are they ashamed of this report? Why do the government not publish this full report? What else are they trying to hide in this report? I think it is an absolute disgrace. I think the people of Australia are entitled to know exactly what is in this report.</para><para>Let me get back to the $50 increase that everybody is supposedly going to get. Not every average family is going to get a tax rebate of $50. If you take out the $10 a week in extra rent then you have $40 extra a week. An extra $40 a week for an average family is not much when they have to buy clothes. Anybody who has children knows that children grow, so you have to constantly buy clothes. You just do not buy clothes every now and again. Children have this habit of growing. Children also have the habit of eating a lot. They do eat a lot, particularly when they get into their teens. Anybody who has teenagers or has had the experience of teenagers knows that these kids are human threshing machines; they eat everything in sight. When your children are teenagers is probably the poorest time of your life. The extra $50 a week will probably go on food. That does not take account of the increases in all the other things that this extra $50 is supposed to compensate for, like school books, electricity charges, phone bills and the other sundry things that one has to buy. If you have repairs done around your house or if you have somebody mow your lawn, this extra $50 a week has to cover increases in those costs. It goes on and on. ·	</para><para>The GST is disgraceful. What you are doing to the Australian people is an absolute disgrace. You are going to make them poorer and poorer. Everybody in this country is going to be poorer. Senator Harradine yesterday talked about a report on the gap widening. The gap is going to widen even further under you people. You are a dreadful government and you are damaging this country like you would not believe.

That Part establishes the universal service regime for telecommunications.  The universal service regime ensures that telephone and digital data services are reasonably accessible to all Australians.  These two components of the regime are known as the universal service obligation (or USO) and the digital data service obligation (or DDSO) respectively.  Currently around 400,000 telephone services are subsidised under the USO.</para><para>The bill has its origins in two particular matters: </para><para>the interim capping by Parliament of Telstra's USO costs for 1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000, and the consequential review of USO arrangements in 1999; and</para><para>the allocation by Parliament of $150 million from the Telstra 2 Social Bonus to provide untimed local calls in remote Australia.</para><para>Against this background the bill has two main objectives.</para><para>Firstly, to enable the Minister to determine a universal service provider's USO cost for up to three years in advance, thus providing an effective method of forward costing the USO and with it, a higher degree of certainty and stability for the industry.</para><para>Secondly, the bill makes a number of amendments to the USO regime to provide prospective participants in the remote Australia untimed local call tender with certainty about the future USO environment they would be operating within should they win the tender.  This certainty will enable prospective tenderers to approach the tender process with more confidence, and make it more likely that the tender will extract the greatest benefit for people in remote Australia and best value for money for the Commonwealth and taxpayers generally.</para><para>It is critical that amendments to achieve these objectives be in place before 1 July 2000.  This will ensure a smooth transition from the current interim capping arrangements, and prevent any possibility of providers accruing compensation entitlements under the default arrangements which have caused such difficulties in the past.  It will also enable the tender to proceed quickly with a view to delivering to remote consumers the benefits intended by Parliament.</para><para>To expedite the passage of these urgent amendments, the Government is introducing them in a short first bill.  A second, substantive bill will be introduced at a later date to implement all elements of the Government's USO reform package announced on 23 March 2000. ·	</para><para>The Government is also taking the opportunity provided by this bill to make a number of relatively simple changes to Part 2 to simplify its administration and enhance its flexibility.  These will assist the Government to progress the USO contestability pilots pending passage of the proposed second bill.</para><para>I would now like to turn to the details of the proposed amendments.</para><para>As a result of the difficulties with the default process for calculating a universal service provider's USO cost, where liabilities are determined <inline font-style="italic">ex post</inline>, a key objective of this bill is to empower the Minister to determine that cost in advance.  This will be the preferred method for setting a universal service provider's cost in the future.</para><para>Forward-looking determination of USO costs will be given effect by amendment of section 57 of the current Act, which deals with the calculation of a universal service provider's net universal service cost. The proposed determination power is modelled on that conferred on the Minister under the capping legislation passed by the Parliament last year.</para><para>The amendments to section 57 will enable the Minister to make a written determination specifying an amount that is to be the USO cost or a method for working out the USO cost for a specified person, or for each person in a specified class, for a specified financial year.  The Minister's determination will be able to encompass up to three successive years, thus providing longer-term certainty for industry.  </para><para>Prior to making a determination the Minister will be able to seek the advice of the ACA and consider any other matter the Minister considers relevant.  </para><para>A Ministerial determination is required to be notified in the Commonwealth Gazette but it will not be disallowable.  This is because determinations will generally relate to significant amounts, and it is important to the operation of universal service providers and the industry as a whole that they be able to stand.  Moreover, if a determination were able to be disallowed, the universal service provider may need to make use of the default subsection 57(2) process, which is administratively demanding and has given rise to significant difficulties in the past.  The nature of USO cost determinations is such that they will inevitably be subject to intense industry, public and Parliamentary scrutiny, regardless of whether or not they are disallowable.  As a matter of course the Minister will need to exercise exceptional diligence in the preparation of such determinations.</para><para>In order to provide prospective participants in the remote Australia untimed local call tender with greater certainty and assist the tender process, the bill addresses three main issues.</para><para>First, tenderers need to be certain they will become the universal service provider for the area covered by the tender should they win it.  Proposed amendments to section 20 of the current Act provides that the person with whom the Commonwealth enters into a written agreement under the <inline font-style="italic">Telstra Corporation Act 1991</inline> in relation to the $150 million for the provision of untimed local calls will, where the agreement so provides, become the regional universal service provider for the region specified in the agreement without the need for a separate declaration.  The commencement date of the person becoming the provider would be as set out in the agreement, and the date would be able to vary between areas within the region.  </para><para>Second, tenderers need to know how the grant the successful tenderer will be  awarded will affect the level of industry funding of ongoing USO costs.  To remove any doubt, proposed amendments will provide that a grant under section 56 or 57 of the Telstra Corporation Act<inline font-style="italic"></inline>should not be taken into account by the ACA, for example, in giving the Minister advice on an appropriate USO cost or in assessing a claim under the default methodology.</para><para>Third, tenderers need to know what ongoing access they will have to information necessary to fulfil their obligations as a universal service provider or otherwise comply with Part 2.  Proposed subsection 24A(2) will enable a new or prospective universal service provider to give a departing or former universal provider a notice requiring the former provider to give the new provider information that will assist the new provider do things it is required or permitted to do under Part 2.  The information must be sought within 6 months of the person being declared or becoming the new universal service provider.  This will enable the new provider to request information, for example, on service location and customer contact details, so that it can manage any customer transfer processes.  A former provider will be required to comply with a reasonable request as soon as practicable.  In the event that there may be dispute as to whether requested information is reasonable in terms of a new provider's needs, the Minister will be able to make a written determination.  Beyond this, the ACA, as industry regulator would, in the first instance, adjudicate on the reasonableness of any request and the time to meet it.  The ACA has powers of direction in relation to compliance with the Act. ·	</para><para>In recognition that in a more dynamic telecommunications environment DDSO providers as well as USO providers could change in an area, similar provisions have been proposed in relation to the DDSO.</para><para>In terms of simplifying the administration of the universal service regime and enhancing its flexibility generally, a number of relatively simple amendments are proposed.  These changes are seen as useful in the context of the proposed tender and pending full implementation of the Government's wider USO reforms.  In many instances the amendments simply streamline arrangements for actions already possible under the Act.  The main amendments in this regard are to:</para><para>enable there to be more than one USO provider in an area at one time without the need, as is now the case, for enabling regulations;</para><para>make it clear that the Minister can consider a range of matters in deciding whether a person should be declared as a USO provider;</para><para>enable carriage service providers as well as carriers to be declared as DDSO providers - thus enabling them to provide their customers with access to industry funded customer equipment rebates and enhancing competitive neutrality; and</para><para>enable the declaration of a universal service provider to come into effect from the time specified in the declaration, as opposed to the current restrictive default of declarations commencing on the first day of the financial year.</para><para>There are a number of minor stylistic and procedural amendments as a result of these changes.  Where appropriate, similar amendments have been made in relation to the DDSO provisions.</para><para>The bill contains a number of application and transitional provisions explaining how the new provisions affect existing instruments.</para><para>In summary, the bill makes several critical and other highly desirable amendments to the current regime for universal service in telecommunications.  Together, the amendments will significantly enhance the operation of the USO and DDSO to the benefit of the large number of Australians who depend upon them, as well as furthering the goal of providing untimed local calls in remote Australia.</para><para>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2000</para><para>This bill will provide legislative authority for the domestic entry into force of a new comprehensive double taxation agreement with Romania and an amending protocol to our existing agreement with Finland. The bill will insert the text of the agreement and the protocol into the <inline font-style="italic">International Tax Agreements Act 1953</inline> as schedules to that Act. </para><para>The agreement between Australia and Romania was signed on 2 February 2000, and the Finnish protocol was signed on 5 November 1997.</para><para>Details of the agreement and the protocol were announced and copies made publicly available following the respective dates of signature.</para><para>The new Romanian agreement generally accords with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years.</para><para>The Finnish protocol amends the existing Finnish agreement to exempt from dividend withholding tax dividends paid out of fully taxed company profits.

The Finnish protocol will enter into force 30 days after the later of similar notifications.

These measures cover the range of illegal activity that threatens to undermine the revenue base for tobacco excise  from the growing of plants destined for the illicit market, to the retailing of under-the-counter chop chop.</para><para>As an indication of the seriousness with which the Government seeks to counter the illicit tobacco trade, the maximum penalties for relevant existing offences will be increased tenfold.</para><para>A number of new offences, specific to the unauthorised movement, dealing and possession of tobacco leaf, will be introduced. In addition to fines, they will provide for maximum terms of imprisonment of 2 years. The maximum pecuniary penalties will be set at 500 penalty units, (currently $55,000) or 5 times the duty that would be payable if the tobacco leaf had been manufactured into tobacco and had been entered into home consumption.</para><para>Tobacco seeds, tobacco plants or tobacco leaf that is found outside the regulated sector will be seized, forfeited to the Commonwealth and destroyed.</para><para>These amendments will introduce a comprehensive licensing scheme for persons engaged in the tobacco industry. Only a licensed producer will be permitted to grow tobacco. Dealers in tobacco seeds, tobacco plants or tobacco leaf will also be required to be licensed. Manufacturers of tobacco, and of other excisable goods, will continue to be required to be licensed, and the new licensing scheme will also apply to the proprietors of premises where excisable goods on which duty has not been paid will be stored.</para><para>Rigorous criteria will be applied to applicants for licences, and a failure to comply with licence conditions may result in the suspension or cancellation of licences.</para><para>Transitional measures will provide for existing licences and registrations to be treated as licences under the new scheme.</para><para>Following discussions with tobacco producer co-operatives it is proposed that a system of monitoring the movement of bales of tobacco leaf be introduced. This will involve identifying labels being attached to tobacco leaf bales as a means of authorising the movement of tobacco leaf from the premises of producers and dealers. This will impose some relatively minor additional record-keeping costs, but will greatly assist in the identification of the movement of tobacco leaf to the illicit market.</para><para>The existing power of Excise officers to stop and search conveyances will be extended. Trucks and other means of transport will be able to be stopped and searched for tobacco leaf or excisable goods if the officer has a reasonable suspicion of an offence being committed.</para><para>To deter distributors of illicit tobacco an infringement notice scheme will be introduced for the less serious offences. Persons who, without authority, sell or possess excisable goods on which duty has not been paid will face an infringement penalty of 20 penalty units, currently $2,200. This will provide an efficient means of addressing the retailing of illicit tobacco. Persons who, instead, are prosecuted in court for this offence will, on a strict liability basis, face a fine of up to 100 penalty units or $11,000. For the more serious offences, the prosecutor could seek a fine of up to 500 penalty units, a term of imprisonment of up to 2 years or, if the court thinks fit, a combination of both.</para><para>Taken together the amendments proposed by this bill will improve the capability of the Australian Taxation Office to more effectively target its compliance enforcement activities against the illicit tobacco trade. They will also provide the means to counter arrangements that seek to defer liability to excise duty, or present a risk of duty evasion. Overall, they will help to protect the excise base which constitutes a significant proportion of Australia's taxation revenue.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of the bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2000 spring sittings in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: PET MEAT AND DOGS BONES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>15503</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>15503</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to provide an explanation in relation to sales tax and a question that was asked in relation to the GST on pet meat and dogs bones.</para></talk.start><para>Leave not granted.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GREENFIELDS FOUNDATION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>15503</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15503</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes the repeated attempts of the Greenfields Foundation to avoid scrutiny by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC);</para><para>	(b)	shares the concern expressed by the AEC in its `Election 1998—Funding and disclosure' report that the Greenfields Foundation provides a model for those who wish to avoid full and open disclosure of political donations;</para><para>	(c)	supports the recommendations of the AEC which are designed to prevent such potential circumvention of the intention of the public disclosure provisions in the Electoral Act; and</para><para>	(d)	calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to amend the Electoral Act in accordance the recommendations of the AEC.</para></motion><para>Without doubt, the Electoral Commission's funding and disclosure report, <inline font-style="italic">Election 1998</inline>, vindicates all of the concerns that the opposition has expressed about the Greenfields Foundation. After extensive inquiries—and, of course, in the face of serious obfuscation from the Liberal Party and the Greenfields Foundation—the AEC has found that the Greenfields model was a device for avoiding the disclosure of political donations, for avoiding the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Basically, the AEC found out what the Labor Party has suspected for a long time: that the Greenfields Foundation is a money laundering vehicle through which the Liberal Party has consistently concealed those who have donated to it. The Electoral Commission's report paints a very unflattering picture of the Liberal Party and a very unflattering picture of the Howard government. It shows up the government for the hypocrites that they are on this question of disclosure of political donations.</para><para>This is the same government that is revving up the ACCC with a vast and complicated regime to ensure that shopkeepers and businesses are complying with its unfair GST. This is the same government that preaches the doctrine of mutual obligation and places more and more conditions on the recipients of benefits. It is a government that is very keen to regulate everybody except its own political machine.</para><para>When it comes to the Liberal Party's compliance with the laws governing its financial affairs or the electoral laws, the AEC has found that the Liberals seek to evade the law, that the Liberals seek to deny the facts, that they always are on the lookout for loopholes, that they conjure up devices to avoid their responsibility—and, of course, in doing so, they show how not to be a law abiding organisation. This is the example that the Liberal Party sets for the rest of the nation. The Liberal Party in its evasive behaviour over Greenfields has shown complete contempt for the law of the land.</para><para>The Greenfields loophole was engineered by the Liberal Party, and the criticisms contained in the Electoral Commission's report are criticisms of the Liberal Party and of its senior political representatives—their current National Director, Mr Lynton Crosby, the former National Director, Mr Andrew Robb, and of course the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Greenfields was, and apparently still is, part of the shonky fundraising apparatus of the Liberal Party. I would like to take this opportunity today to detail for the benefit of the Senate the history of this sleazy outfit, the Greenfields Foundation. It has a nice name, a very nice name—the Greenfields Foundation—but it does not have a very pretty history. </para><para>It all began back in 1994-95. We had a situation where the national office of the Liberal Party was in financial trouble, as happens to all political parties, let me quickly say—political parties of all persuasions have financial trouble, and that is what happened to the Liberal Party. The National Australia Bank requested the title to Menzies House as security for the Liberal Party's substantial overdraft. They had run up quite a debt in the 1993 federal election. The treasurer of the Liberal Party at the time, one Mr Ron Walker, was given the task of remedying the situation. Of course he is entitled to do that. He is entitled to work for the political party that he is a long-time supporter and member of, provided that he acts within the law. That is the obligation on Mr Walker: whatever he does has to be lawful. What occurred was that, at least by Mr Walker's own admission—we have no proof of it—he came up with $4.6 million himself in the form of a guarantee over the debt. Mr Ron Walker guaranteed the Liberal Party's $4.6 million debt to the National Australia Bank, and Mr Walker then apparently assigned his debt to the mysterious Greenfields Foundation, a so-called `charitable' foundation, some time in mid-1996. You have to ask yourself: why would Ron Walker want to avoid disclosure? Surely if he is putting $4.6 million— ·	</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—He should be proud. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Exactly, Senator Conroy—into the Liberal Party, you would think he would be proud of it.

He hid his light under a bushel. Ron Walker, Mr Modesty—the self-effacing Ron Walker—did not want the Liberal Party and its supporters to know what a hero he was, that he had fronted up with $4.6 million. He is not a vain man. He is not a boastful man, as we all know. He is not an extravagant man; he is just Mr Modesty. He did not let anybody know that he had fronted up with $4.6 million—an extraordinary act of generosity under the cloak of the Greenfields Foundation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Note that Greenfields is not a registered company; it is a foundation.

I have to be honest: I do not think it really was too tough a job for Ron Walker because the Greenfields Foundation was just the Liberal Party's old fundraising arm, the old Free Enterprise Foundation, reborn in a new impenetrable form. So up until 1995, the Free Enterprise Foundation donated huge sums to the coalition but was not required to reveal the donations it received. The then Labor government closed the loophole in the Electoral Act. </para><para>The Liberal Party, it seems, felt that it had to find another way to conceal its fundraising. Enter the Greenfields Foundation. Enter Mr Ron Walker. Lo and behold, two of the three trustees of the Greenfields Foundation are also trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation; namely, Tony Bandle and the former National President of the Liberal Party, Sir John Atwill. The two foundations even shared the same post office box in Deakin West for some time. So the Liberal Party just swung its secret fundraising activities from one foundation to another. It is like the way a car thief would try to avoid being caught by changing the number plates on a stolen car: same car, different plates—same dodgy fundraising outfit, just a slightly different structure to steer it through a loophole in the act. </para><para>The Liberal Party has made only token repayments of the debt it has with Greenfields. As much as we can detect, the Liberal Party has repaid only $200,000 of the debt. On a loan of $4.6 million, that equates to an extremely generous interest rate of about two per cent. There was no doubt that these extraordinarily generous terms represented a significant benefit to the Liberal Party. It is no wonder that the AEC got a little suspicious. It is no wonder the AEC wrote to Greenfields back in 1997 to ask them to put in an annual return. One of the Greenfields trustees, Tony Bandle, wrote back to the AEC in January 1998 to the effect that Greenfields was not an associated entity of the Liberal Party. In his letter, Tony Bandle had the gall to say that Greenfields did not operate for the benefit of any registered political party. He went on to say that the application of any part of the trust fund for the benefit of a political party would be inconsistent with the object of the trust deed. Of course this was just pious, misleading claptrap from Mr Bandle. What a joke! To say that that conferred no benefit on the Liberal Party was a deliberate and calculated lie. The AEC's assessment states:  ·	</para><quote><para>It was concluded that Greenfields was treating the Liberal Party in an uncommonly favourable manner in that it appeared that annual repayments of only $100,000 on the original debt of $4,750,000 had been demanded and that no interest had been charged or demanded. The AEC's view was that the trustee's lenient treatment of the Liberal Party in servicing the debt represented a benefit to the party.</para></quote><para>Over June and July 1998, the Liberal Party had a lot of meetings with the AEC. The opposition was putting pressure on it in the parliament. To their credit on this one, the AEC were not snowed by the Liberal Party and its mates at Greenfields. On 23 July 1998, the relationship between Mr Ron Walker and the Greenfields Foundation was revealed in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. Again, you have to ask yourself: why would Ron Walker want to avoid disclosure? Surely, if he is putting up so much money, he would be proud of it. You think he would be a hero—a modern day Rockefeller. You would think he would be seen as a philanthropist for the needy, for that great charity at the top end of town—the Liberal Party. To all the spivs and urgers in the Liberal Party boardroom, you would think Mr Walker would be a hero. But, of course, no, he chose to hide it. He chose to disguise this extraordinary act of generosity under the cloak of the Greenfields Foundation.</para><para>Let us skip forward to January 1999, when the AEC served Greenfields with a notice under section 316 of the Electoral Act to produce documents. That was a serious step for the AEC to take. Failure to comply with such a notice is a criminal offence and the fine is hefty. In June 1999, such was the concern at the AEC over its Greenfields investigation that the AEC briefed senior counsel to advise it on the Liberal Party's use of the Greenfields loophole and its apparent failure to disclose. At around this time, the AEC also started closely consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to Greenfields. In December 1999, the AEC found that Greenfields was, in fact, an associated entity—as the opposition had been saying. As a result, Greenfields was finally forced to lodge a return with the Australian Electoral Commission some two years after it was requested to do so. In a fit of petulance, the Greenfields heavies refused to sign the return, such is the contempt for the law in the Liberal Party and the Greenfields Foundation. I doubt very much if the tax office is going to allow small businesses such latitude with their tax returns and payments under the GST, but it is okay for the Liberals!</para><para>The AEC furnished the minister with its report on Greenfields on 17 March 2000. This report was part of the AEC's <inline font-style="italic">Funding and Disclosure Report—Election 1998</inline>. The responsible minister, Minister Ellison, then sat on the report until the last round of estimates had finished, such was his courage of course in facing up to questions about Greenfields and his confidence in the propriety of the activities of the Liberal Party and the Greenfields Foundation. Naturally, the Electoral Commission was concerned about the `uncommonly favourable manner' in which Greenfields treated the Liberals' debt to it and found that Greenfields' `lenient treatment of the Liberal Party in servicing the debt represented a benefit to the party'.</para><para>Despite the Greenfields Foundation lodging, under protest, disclosure returns covering from 1996 to 1999, the AEC made it clear in its report that it did not believe this sleazy Greenfields operation was consistent with the spirit of the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The report states, `A person ... or in certain circumstances a corporation' could avoid disclosure by `a series of transactions based on the Greenfields model', and recommends that the loophole be closed `as a matter of priority'. Labor has been arguing for three years that this loophole, exploited by the Liberals, should be properly closed. I suppose the AEC had to take at face value what Mr Ron Walker said—his assertion that he personally covered the $4.6 million debt. But the AEC warns:</para><quote><para>Should the creditor not have any individual disclosure obligations, for instance as an associated entity, the identity of the guarantor—the real source of the funds—need not be disclosed anywhere.</para></quote><para>In other words, the Liberal Party has engineered a mechanism to hide the identity of its real political donors. ·	</para><para>This story of the Greenfields Foundation is a story of lies, deviousness, obstruction and cover-up by the Liberal Party. The actions of the Greenfields Foundation were sanctioned by the Liberal Party at the highest levels. They were coordinated by the Liberal Party at the highest levels. They were organised by the Liberals at the highest levels. In doing so, the impact of this exposure of the activities of the Greenfields Foundation and the Liberal Party severely sullies the credibility of the Liberal Party, if the Liberal Party has any credibility left.</para><para>Through the AEC's diligent inquiries we have now discovered part of the Greenfields story. The parts of the Greenfields story we do not know—which are very important parts, and Labor will continue to attempt to get to the bottom of them—are: who really put up the $4.6 million, and for what political reason did that person or company put up the money? They are important issues, and the Labor Party will not let them go. We will eventually get the answer to those two questions. But what we now know is that the Liberal Party established the Greenfields Foundation as the vehicle for hiding secret political donations and that has been exposed at last by the Australian Electoral Commission.</para><para>The Liberal Party's behaviour in this has been absolutely disgraceful. It has shown complete contempt for the law. It has shown the sort of arrogance that has become part and parcel of the modus operandi of the Howard government. I think the public is right to expect that governments will act in the public interests, not in the interests of the big end of town; and it is only in the interests of the big end of town that this sleazy operation has been conducted. The Liberals have just been caught out on the Greenfields rort. They have been caught out by the AEC, they have been caught out by the Labor Party. We intend to get to the bottom of Mr Walker's role and the role of the Liberal Party and the sleazy outfit that is the Greenfields Foundation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>15506</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today we have heard a lot from Senator Faulkner in relation to the Greenfields Foundation. It is something that he has been on about for some time. In fact, the language he has used today has not changed. I think that the language that has been used by the opposition, particularly by Senator Faulkner, shows exactly the lack of objectivity that they bring to this debate. When you look at the <inline font-style="italic">Funding and Disclosure Report—Election 1998</inline>, you do not find that the AEC found the Liberal Party sought to evade the law and you do not find that the AEC found that the Greenfields Foundation was seeking to evade the law or that it was a money laundering racket, as alleged by Senator Faulkner. But what you do find is that there was an inquiry carried out by the AEC in relation to the Greenfields Foundation, that the Greenfields Foundation took a view that it was not an associated entity and that the AEC took the view that it was.</para></talk.start><para>In coming to that conclusion there had to be inquiry on the side of both the AEC and the Greenfields Foundation. The Greenfields Foundation stood firmly by the view that it was not an associated entity. But when the AEC decided that it was and that it should provide these returns, the Greenfields Foundation did so. It did so under protest. It said, `We provide this information even though we don't agree with the assessment.' It is not uncommon in a number of areas of business today, and in areas of government interfacing with business, to hear people saying, `We provide you with this information under protest because we do not believe that we have to. But you've made a decision that we should, and we will.' That is entirely appropriate. There is nothing sleazy about that. There is absolutely nothing which would indicate evasion of scrutiny or an attempt to evade scrutiny in that. Greenfields complied with the request made by the AEC. The fact that they had a different view, or a view that did not sit comfortably with Senator Faulkner, does not matter a jot. In fact, the fact that the Greenfields Foundation regarded that it was not an associated entity and Senator Faulkner thought it was is of no great moment.</para><para>If Senator Faulkner and the opposition were genuine they would look at this report in detail and at some of the other recommendations that I will come to in a moment. If they were genuine they would look forward to the matter being referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That is the proper venue for this to be looked at. The government would, of course, take on board any report by that committee, as it usually does. That would be the proper way of working through whether any amendment was needed to the Electoral Act. The AEC goes into some detail as to how some amendment to the act could be made in relation to deeming or that a guarantee be deemed to be a gift for the purposes of the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is a submission, a recommendation, made by the AEC in the funding and disclosure report which takes its place among many other recommendations. Those recommendations the government will have regard to and, more appropriately, those recommendations should be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. There is nothing in this report which says that Greenfields is in any way sleazy or a money laundering racket or that it is evading detection by the AEC. What we have here is a very matter-of-fact recommendation by the AEC in looking at a provision—a rather technical provision—dealing with how one looks at a guarantee for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. ·	</para><para>As I mentioned, this report relates to other areas. I note that Senator Faulkner, once again, only concentrates on the Greenfields Foundation. He does not mention any of these other recommendations. It is interesting that he does not, because it shows the bias that the opposition have in relation to this. If they were dinkum about fixing or amending anything in relation to the Electoral Act, we would hear debate on some of the other recommendations which deal with payment of election funding, registration of political parties, party constitutions and election and referendum returns by broadcasters and publishers. All those aspects were covered by the AEC in its report, but we hear nothing from Labor. In fact, all we hear is `the Greenfields Foundation' again and again, ad nauseam.</para><para>Let us look at what the Labor Party is saying in relation to Centenary House, a property which it owns. Absolutely nothing. Why? Because when the Labor Party was in government it arranged a rental arrangement whereby there would be a multimillion dollar income stream, courtesy of the taxpayer, to the Labor Party via a lease with exit conditions which made it impossible for the National Audit Office to break it. So when the Labor Party was in power it had a situation where the National Audit Office entered into a lease agreement with a property owned by the Labor Party under conditions which were not only burdensome but had exit conditions making it virtually impossible for the National Audit Office to break that lease if it had to. It is all very well for the Labor opposition to come in here and talk about the Greenfields Foundation. Why doesn't it talk about what it did with Centenary House?</para><para>But there is also another aspect. We are talking about a foundation here which the trustees maintain was set up for charitable purposes. I wonder why the Labor opposition does not talk about the funding of the Labor Party by the trade union movement. In fact, why do we not have disclosure provisions, which everyone wants to apply to corporate Australia, applying to the trade union movement? We hear a deafening silence from the Labor Party in relation to this. They are all very quick to talk about corporate donors giving money to various parties, but you hear absolutely nothing from them in relation to some disclosure in relation to trade union movements and where they apply their money.</para><para>I note that this was just a subject of comment the other day by the Melbourne University in a report which looked at corporate donations. The Melbourne University Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation concentrated on disclosure by corporations, but not a word in relation to trade unions.

In fact, we saw the influence of the trade union movements getting value for money for their donations in the absolute backflip that the Labor Party did on industrial relations, going back to pre-Keating days—and that is saying something—in relation to enterprise bargaining. What you have here is the left wing of the trade union movement now calling in the dollars that it has given to the Labor Party and getting a change in policy. That is something we do not hear Senator Faulkner talking about. We do not hear him talking about that. We do not hear him talking about Centenary House. We do not hear him talking about more disclosure for trade union donations, or the members being consulted as to where their money should go. No, nothing like that. All we hear is `the Greenfields Foundation', and we have heard it ad nauseam for the last two years.

That is an entirely proper process.</para><para>Senator Faulkner in this motion demands that the government bring on urgent legislation to accommodate this recommendation. I would remind the Labor Party of the last time it rushed into making decisions in relation to electoral reform, and I point to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) in 1998, where a hastily prepared amendment by the Labor Party resulted in a situation where a candidate in an election would have to disclose every single purchase he or she made under $1,500 on their credit card. It was so hastily put together that it had to be amended by the government so it was made workable. That is why the government does not rush in to legislation and does not make legislation on the run in an important area such as electoral reform. We will consider any report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters when it comes to hand, and so we should. But for the Labor opposition to say that we should rush into any amendment on the run is totally inappropriate. In fact, they just have to look at the bungled attempt they made to amend the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. ·	</para><para>Senator Faulkner says that there was some attempt not to provide this report. It was tabled in time, entirely within the time limits. There has been no problem in relation to the tabling of this document. Senator Faulkner draws a long bow when he says that the government is in some way sensitive or concerned about this report. The government is not in any way sensitive about this report. In fact, as I have said, we have dealt with and we are looking at the recommendations, and we will deal with them when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters gives us its report. We are willing to look at all of these recommendations. We are willing to talk about them, as I have done today. We are willing to mention them—unlike the Labor opposition, which only singles out one recommendation, which it beats up as being an attack on the Greenfields Foundation. If they are dinkum, let us hear them talk about the recommendations—which go up to something like 16. Let us hear them use this time to usefully debate this, rather than to have partisan attacks in relation to the Greenfields Foundation.</para><para>But, of course, they are not dinkum about electoral reform. They are only intent on scoring a political point. If they were dinkum, they would talk about the rort with Centenary House. If they were dinkum, they would talk about trade unions being treated just like corporations in relation to donations and they would be calling upon trade union members to be informed and to have some say as to where their money went in relation to political donations. That is what they would do if they were dinkum, but they are not. You can see that by the language that they use. The very language they use is totally one of bile and vitriol and one of attempting to score a political point where there is none to be made. I would ask the opposition to join with the government in looking at electoral reform, to join with the government in looking at any report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and, in a constructive way, to join with the government in looking at these recommendations—rather than using this as an attempt to make some party partisan point which really does not exist.</para><para>We need to remind ourselves that Australia has one of the most rigorous disclosure regimes in the world today. Australia has one of the best electoral systems in the free world today and it has a rigorous disclosure regime, and that is one which is being looked at continually. In fact, you see that by the very process of this funding and disclosure report. It says to the Australian people that there is a system in place whereby the current electoral arrangements are continually under review. Not only do we have a review after each election, to see if we can do things better; we also have a periodical review of funding and disclosure in relation to political donations. You cannot do better than that. The system that we enjoy in this country is second to none, and the opposition would well be reminded of that, and would be well reminded to approach this in a constructive manner to make it better and to work on ways of improving our electoral system, rather than making some cheap, grubby attempt at scoring some political point.</para><para>But, if they want to go down that track, they should be open and tell the people of Australia about Centenary House and how when they were in government they got the Australian National Audit Office to go into a lease in relation to a property that the Labor Party owned. If they were dinkum, and if they wanted to go down that path, they should tell the Australian people about how trade unions fund the Labor Party and what say trade unions members get in that. What say do they get? Are they consulted before trade unions give money taken from the fees of workers who might not agree with where that money is going? Perhaps the Labor Party ought to think about that and dwell on why membership of the trade union movement is falling. Maybe that could be a reason. If Senator Conroy was dinkum, he would think about that. They might just also look at the provisions that they might like to bring into funding and disclosure in relation to the trade union movement and what demands it makes on the Labor Party in return for its financial donations. Whenever you raise this, you always get the very aggressive response that we have seen today, because it hits a nerve.

The AEC has delivered a report with a lot of food for thought in its recommendations. The government says that this should go to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and then we will deal with the report. That is the appropriate course of action, and we are not going to make any legislation on the run, as Labor tried to do when it bungled its attempt to amend the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) in 1998.

Oftentimes in this place reports are tabled in quite great numbers and we only get a brief opportunity to debate, examine and consider them and highlight some aspects of them.</para></talk.start><para>This motion provides an opportunity to look in much more detail at this one aspect of the report, and I think it is an important part. The broader report as a whole contains a range of recommendations—16 recommendations, I think—across a range of areas relating to not just funding disclosure, although mostly, but also other aspects in terms of registration of political parties and other matters in terms of disclosure of returns. But it does have a specific chapter dedicated solely to the Greenfields Foundation, which I think highlights how significant this entity is and how clear-cut the case is that it has been used quite specifically to try to dodge the disclosure provisions in the act. You would not have the Australian Electoral Commission dedicating an entire chapter of a report to a foundation if it was not quite clear that this was a matter of concern to them—an area where they believed the disclosure provisions of the act were being deliberately circumvented by this particular foundation. No observer could read this chapter or this part of the report, part 5, without coming to that conclusion. It is quite clear from what the AEC themselves have written that the Greenfields Foundation had been structured and was operating in a way specifically aimed at circumventing the disclosure provisions of the act.</para><para>It is important to emphasise why the disclosure components of the act are so important. This is an issue that the Democrats have worked on very hard for many years, going back to my Queensland predecessor Senator Michael Macklin in the 1980s. A number of the disclosure provisions and the initial components requiring reporting of donations go back to that time and some of the work of former Senator Macklin in particular, as well as to people from other parties. Over time, as often happens when you put in place provisions aimed at providing transparency and accountability for political donations, people look for ways to get around them. Subsequent amendments to the act continue to need to be made to deal with attempts to circumvent the intent of the act. There is no doubt that the Greenfields Foundation was clearly an attempt to circumvent the disclosure provisions of the act. That can be demonstrated not only by the record of what it did but also by the difficulty the AEC had in getting requests met by the Greenfields Foundation—the difficulty they had in extracting information from the foundation. That record is also outlined in this part of the report. ·	</para><para>A recommendation specifically goes to this matter, as Senator Ellison outlined, suggesting that the payment of a guarantee should be deemed to be a gift for the purposes of the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is a pretty straightforward recommendation. I am not sure why it would need an extensive examination by the electoral matters committee. I am a member of that Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and it has just concluded its fairly extensive inquiry into the 1998 federal election. It will be bringing down its report in this chamber on the next sitting day, on Monday. It is obviously not appropriate to reveal the contents of the report in any way, but I do not think it is any great secret to suggest that disclosure provisions will get a mention in there. This is something that committee members are already well aware of and I do not see any particular reason why this recommendation needs to be examined by the committee before it could be incorporated in the act. It is quite a clear-cut and straightforward one, and obviously the AEC believes that it is important. It is worth quoting from paragraph 5.1.2 of the report, where the AEC states:</para><quote><para>The failure of a donor to lodge a disclosure return and the inability of the AEC to identify that donor and enforce their disclosure responsibility is a serious loophole open to exploitation either intentionally or unintentionally.</para></quote><para>Quite clearly in this case it was intentional. It is the opinion of the AEC that recent amendments to the act effected by the electoral and referendum amendment bill do not fully address the loophole—primarily because there remains no requirement for disclosure of the guarantor and therefore no link to the donor, the true source of the funds. Those amendments made to the act through the amendment bill last year were in part derived from a focus on the activities of the Greenfields Foundation. The amendments may or may not have been perfectly worded the first time they were put forward by the ALP, but I think it is appropriate to pay credit to the ALP and Senator Faulkner for persisting with this issue. There is no doubt that, without that focus on the activities of the Greenfields Foundation and that spotlight being shone on what they are up to, those changes to the act would not have been made. So it is worth acknowledging that this tightening has been made because of the focus of Senator Faulkner on the Greenfields Foundation. The AEC has expressed an opinion that the loophole is still not fully addressed. I think it is appropriate for the Senate to acknowledge that and to seek to act on it.</para><para>There is another specific section in the report where the AEC makes it quite clear that foundations established in a way similar to the Greenfields Foundation would still be able to do the same thing, even as the act currently stands. So this could still be occurring now. It is obviously, by definition, difficult to identify if this sort of activity is deliberately being done because of the loopholes in the disclosure provisions. To quote again from section 5.6 of the report, the AEC states:</para><quote><para>It is apparent that a person or, in certain circumstances, a corporation who wishes to avoid full and open disclosure could do so by a series of transactions based on the Greenfields model.</para></quote><para>So you have the AEC saying there quite clearly that people who wish to avoid full and open disclosure have a mechanism to do so. That is a matter of great concern to the Democrats and it should be of great concern to all parties in this place. Having full and open disclosure is an important part of having a credible electoral system.</para><para>All senators will agree that there is a degree of public cynicism about our political process, about the operation of political parties and about the influence of big money. It is on nowhere near as serious a scale as in the USA, but it is still there and it is a legitimate concern for the public to have. One of the best ways to address that concern is to ensure that we have disclosure provisions that are completely open, transparent and effective. When the Australian Electoral Commission, an independent body established to oversee those provisions, tell us that the provisions as they currently operate are not fully effective and that there is a loophole—they are indeed pointing at a loophole and saying, `Here it is, here's how you can do it'—that obviously presents a serious problem and a potential threat to public confidence in the integrity of our political system. ·	</para><para>It is an important issue and is one that should therefore be addressed urgently and acknowledged as serious. Senator Ellison spoke about union donations and whether union members should have a say in donations; others may talk about shareholders having a say as well. Those are important issues, but they should not be used as a distraction from the core issue that the AEC has identified in this part of the report, and they should not be used as a distraction from the core component of this motion. The AEC has identified this loophole, and the parliament has a responsibility to do something about it. </para><para>The issue of people having the opportunity to have a say in whether or not corporations or trade unions make donations is an issue that the Democrats have pursued from time to time. The main issue there is to have an even-handed approach. I know an independent report came down yesterday, which made recommendations that shareholders should have a say in corporate donations to political parties and suggested that company reports should disclose those donations. Company donations will now be disclosed through the Electoral Commission, but shareholders will not necessarily know to look there. I think it is a worthy recommendation to suggest that disclosure of those donations should be in company reports. For an even-handed approach, it would also be appropriate for similar provisions to apply through trade unions. The Democrats do not have a problem with that. As often happens in this place, you have one side suggesting that unions should do it and the other side suggesting that business should have to do it, but neither side suggesting that both should have to do it. The Democrats believe that both doing it could well be a good idea. However, that is not actually the focus of this motion, so I should not speak further on the topic, and it is not the focus of the Greenfields Foundation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—The minister did it at some length.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—I know the minister did it at some length, which is why I responded to it. But, while it is a worthy topic for consideration, it should not be used as a distraction from the key component of this aspect of the AEC report, which is that they have identified a loophole, they have stated that it clearly can be used to avoid full and open disclosure, and they have put forward a recommendation to close that loophole. That is a self-contained issue, separate from some of those other issues about corporations or trade unions, and it should be considered on its merits. The motion that we are debating today specifically addresses that. I would hope the government takes it seriously and does acknowledge that it is a serious issue. If we have a loophole in the act that allows disclosure provisions to be avoided, we should close it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The AEC produce reports like these at public expense for us to act on. They do not produce them for their own amusement or their intellectual gratification. They produce them so that recommendations can be acted upon. Obviously, the recommendations have to be fully considered before they are acted on, but this issue is not a new one. The issue of the Greenfields Foundation has been going on now for three or four years. Indeed, this chamber considered it in detail when we were making those amendments to legislation last year. It is not something that we need to examine from scratch; it is something that we already have a good understanding of. The AEC has pointed to a simple action, and the Democrats believe that that recommendation should be actioned. We support the motion as moved by Senator Faulkner and would hope that the government do take it seriously as, hopefully, they will take seriously the much broader report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters when it is tabled in this chamber on Monday.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15512</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to agree with my colleagues that the report by the Electoral Commission is damning of the Liberal Party and damning of Ron Walker, the federal treasurer of the Liberal Party. As is now clear from the report of the Electoral Commission, Ron Walker prefers to conduct his activities in a surreptitious manner. As the Electoral Commission recommends, such activities should be disclosed. Ron Walker is not an individual of integrity, and his litany of deceit and misdeeds can be traced back over many years. ·	</para></talk.start><para>When Ron Walker first stood for Melbourne City Council, he said he was 30. This was not true. In actual fact, he was 28. His reason for lying? An article from the <inline font-style="italic">Good Weekend</inline> of 17 July 1999 states that Ron Walker had not believed a man of his youth could get elected. `Let's just not tell the electors of Melbourne the truth.' These are the ethics of Ron Walker. He told another journalist at the time that he had put his age up at 17 to land a sales job. Ron Walker's life of deceit started early. An early <inline font-style="italic">Who's who</inline> entry states that Ron Walker attended Melbourne University. What did he study? It is reported in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 3 March 1996 that he had told the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> that he had studied chemistry. The University of Melbourne has no record of Ron Walker graduating. The current <inline font-style="italic">Who's who</inline> entry is silent on whether Ron Walker has any tertiary qualifications. But journalists have to be careful what they report about Ron Walker. It was reported in an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 3 March 1996 that one town hall reporter for a daily paper wrote a mildly critical appraisal of Ron Walker's first eight months as Lord Mayor, including the fact that Ron Walker had muddied the details of his real age. The article states: </para><quote><para>... the story was never run and mysteriously, the reporter was transferred immediately to the `graveyard' police rounds night shift ... for three years.</para></quote><para>In another incident, Walker asked a journalist to pull a story regarding Walker's great friend Lloyd Williams. Dominion Properties, of which Lloyd Williams was a director, was ordered to demolish a South Yarra block of flats because they had been built without planning permission. The journalist reported that Walker had stepped in to try to help Williams. The journalist, however, had courage and integrity and did not succumb to Ron Walker's request to pull the story.</para><para>Let us move on in listing Mr Walker's litany of misdeeds. Ron Walker is often congratulated on building up his Brooke Barmer group. This group was, under the ownership of Ron Walker, one of the biggest private chemical companies in Australia. In 1976, a fire occurred at a chemical factory of Ron Walker's. The arson squad was called in and an investigation was undertaken. By Ron Walker's own admission, the business was `struggling'. In fact, I understand that the ANZ Bank was going to put in an administrator the following week. But no, Ron got wind, the building burnt down and the insurance was claimed. Was the fire just a coincidence? I leave you to judge. Around the same period, Ron Walker was also involved in giving secret commissions to Norm Gallagher, the former secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

Questions still need to be answered. If I may, I will read briefly from an article by Glenn Milne which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 25 March 1996. The article says:</para><quote><para>In Melbourne business and political circles, Walker is known as “Wong Job Won”, a nickname allegedly earned as a result of a conversation between Gallagher—who has a speech impediment—and Walker after the BLF stopped a concrete pour on a job being carried out by Williams's and Walker's construction company, Hudson Conway. Walker allegedly rang Gallagher and asked what was going on. After checking, Gallagher called back and by way of apology declared “Wong Job Won”. The basis on which Walker believed Hudson Conway was exempt from such BLF actions remains a matter of conjecture.</para></quote><para>There is no writ there. No-one is questioning Glenn Milne's article. It does remain a matter of conjecture, but it is pretty clear that Ron Walker has a lot of explaining to do. Then we turn to the casino bid. Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker had now gotten together in other ways. Together with Sir Roderick Carnegie, Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker formed Hudson Conway, the holding company of the company which won the licence for the Melbourne casino. Ron Walker served as a director of Hudson Conway from 25 February 1987 to 16 February 2000. Several issues have arisen in the context of the bid for the casino licence which remain unanswered. Did the former Victorian Premier Mr Kennett give Ron Walker an unfair advantage over other rivals for the casino licence? How was it that Crown knew to raise its bid in the last months of the tender to match its rival? How did Ron Walker know increasing the bid by $135 million would make the bid competitive to Sheraton's? ·	</para><para>There are also questions about whether Ron Walker abused his position as chairman of the Melbourne Major Events company by not announcing during the tender period that he had negotiated an agreement for the Adelaide grand prix to be moved to Melbourne. Ron Walker signed the deal to bring the grand prix to Melbourne in March 1993, but a formal announcement was not made until December 1993. It has been reported that, if that announcement had been made prior to the end of the tender period, Crown's rival, Melbourne Casinos Ltd, would have upped its bid. The value of the inside knowledge to the Crown bid is obvious from what has now been revealed from tapes of Crown's business plan presentation to the Casino Control Authority. The following quote is from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 10 April this year. Part of the transcripts of the tapes are reproduced. Mr Ken Carnie, Communications Director for Crown, is reported as having said to the authority:</para><quote><para>I must ask on this last slide that you will be shot if you mention this outside this room. I have here the signed contracts for the Grand Prix for Victoria. This is not just a promise, this is for real—we have the documents signed by FOCA in London.

What it amounts to is the biggest sporting property in Australia by a long way, producing a television audience of 510 million.</para><para>Crown and Victoria's name behind them is a huge boost to this city.

We are still to obtain answers on the matters which arose in connection with the construction of a building by the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria by Gleem Pty Ltd, a company at the time associated with Hudson Conway.

It was found that Hudson Conway had permitted the use of a letter which contained an opinion that, to the knowledge of Hudson Conway, was not held honestly or on reasonable grounds. But then Ron Walker has always had trouble understanding what it means to be honest. </para><para>Now, finally, it has been revealed by the Electoral Commission in its report, <inline font-style="italic">Funding and Disclosure Report—Election 1998, </inline>that the deeds of Ron Walker are not to be admired. It just shows how far he will go to further his own commercial interests. My colleagues have said earlier how damning the report is for the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party and Ron Walker are both to be condemned for their disgraceful behaviour over the Greenfields Foundation, for their lack of integrity and for their complete disregard for the interests of Australia and the system of democracy in Australia. Ron Walker should not be trusted. Ron Walker had Premier Kennett in his own back pocket and now he is going after the federal Liberal Party.

Trico, a famous Victorian company, as Senator McGauran would know if he was still here, gave a loan to a company that was independent called Seaworld. That is the Seaworld up on the Gold Coast. This was prior to it being purchased by Village Roadshow and Movie World. Seaworld was having serious difficulties. In fact, Trico set down some fairly tough default provisions. These included that, if Seaworld's share price dropped below a certain level, it would be wound up, and this would have been disastrous for Movie World, which is owned by the adjoining Village Roadshow.</para><para>A number of questions arise out of this, and these are questions that APRA should ask. Has ASIC's Queensland office conducted an investigation of Hudson Conway regarding its involvement with Seaworld? Did ASIC conduct an investigation of price ramping of Seaworld's share price? Did any director or former director of Village Roadshow get issued with a share distribution and then get called in, resign their position and hand back or reduce their distribution? Were any directors of Village Roadshow interviewed by ASIC over this matter? Did Hudson Conway or any director in Hudson Conway receive any financial benefit from Village Roadshow or any favouritism? Did ASIC interview staff of Hudson Conway regarding the Seaworld share purchases? Did staff deny keeping records of said purchases? Did ASIC interview staff who then admitted that records were kept? Did ASIC serve a notice on Hudson Conway to produce these documents within 24 hours? Were these documents delivered to ASIC? Did ASIC raid Hudson Conway seeking these documents? Had these documents been destroyed? Was it 12 hours before the raid by ASIC when these documents were destroyed? Who was responsible for directing those documents be destroyed? Was the cleaner interviewed at his home? Did he admit he was directed by Hudson Conway officials to destroy the documents? Was the cleaner formally interviewed the next day? If this is true, when the cleaner was formally interviewed the next day following his interview the previous day at his home, did he arrive at the interview with ASIC with lawyers in tow and mysteriously suddenly need an interpreter because he couldn't speak English?

But what I do see is this: the obvious duplicity coming from the other side is quite disturbing in its magnitude. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have been in the Waterside Workers Federation. Senator Conroy made a big play about Mr Walker putting his age up from 28 to 30. Not a big deal. That is hardly anything that one would compare with some of the happenings in the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. It is hardly anything that one would compare with what happens in Senator Conroy's own state where he stacks branches with non-English speaking people. It is hardly anything at all when you consider that I put my age up from 13 to 15 and worked on the waterside. I had to pay the union dues. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, later on I thought I did rather well by putting my age from 13 to 15 so when I was 16 I put my age up to 19 and joined the militia. I did not think anything of that. I got kicked out on my way to Korea from a school for non-commissioned officers in Seymour. But there is nothing wrong with that. When you are imperfect, and as imperfect as the Labor Party is throughout Australia, one should not make accusations of this nature because most decent people—and there are decent people on the other side, too—do not believe those accusations that Senator Conroy has made.</para><para>Associated entities is the big issue here today. Let me come back to company donations. Lobby groups in Australia gave more than $9 million to the ALP at the last election. What happened to that $9 million? Where did that go? I could stand up here, as Senator Conroy did, and say that that $9 million was syphoned off by some of the crooks in the Labor Party movement, they used it for going overseas or they diverted it to their own use. But I do not have any proof of that. I have a suspicion, but I do not have any proof. I do not think those sorts of comments actually lift the standards of this place whatsoever. ·	</para><para>What we do know is that the conservative side of politics gets money from lobby groups too. We get money from the banks. You get money from the banks as well. We get money from industrialists and you get money from industrialists.

Mr Walker is a very well respected man, a man who has done well. There is nothing wrong with ambition.

The Victorian manufacturing unions recently got fined $40,000 for acting corruptly. They were acting corruptly, and I do not think some people on the other side agree with this.

Governor Phillip in Sydney is let at $600 a square metre per year. They are not bad buildings. I think that is probably in the ballpark. Darling Park 1 and 2 in Sydney are let at $600 a square metre per year for mid floors and $400 a square metre per year for other floors. When things were going bad in Canberra—they have picked up now—the cost of letting Centenary House in Canberra was $618 a square metre net. So at some of the best positions in Sydney you had businesses paying less per square metre per year than they were paying for Centenary House in Canberra—$600 to $618 per square metre. There has to be some corruption there and ASIC should have a look at that. ASIC should go back and have a look at the books, if you can ever get them, if you can ever find out whether associated entities own those places. </para><para>When someone like Senator Conroy, who is devoid of any political courage whatsoever, attacks decent people in this house, one is forced to retaliate when one might normally not say things about it.

I think deep in their own heart they are totally ashamed of the Greenfields scam. So what do they do? Senators Lightfoot and Ellison come into the chamber and say that the trade union movement makes donations to the Labor Party—shock, horror, hold the front page! They also say that those donations are not disclosed. Of course they are disclosed. They are in our annual reports. They are in the Electoral Commission's reports. They also overestimate the effect of those donations. Union donations and affiliation fees today make up less than 20 per cent of Labor's revenue base. But the other side like to try to exaggerate that. But what else do they do? They attack Centenary House. Both Senator Ellison and Senator Lightfoot attack Centenary House. Don't they recall that there was a full judicial inquiry into that contract? Don't they recall that Justice Morling brought down a report that said there was nothing unlawful? To reinforce that, this same government reappointed Justice Morling to the supplemented Electoral Commission, showing full confidence in him. But why don't we have a judicial inquiry into Greenfields to square the ledger? We, in government, authorised a full judicial inquiry into Centenary House. Do you think this government will ever have the courage to have a full judicial inquiry into the machinations of Greenfields? Absolutely never. </para></talk.start><para>But if you want a statement to take the absolute cake, go back to see what Senator Ellison said at the end of his speech. He said that the disclosure laws in Australia are without parallel, that they are the envy of the rest of the world. I probably agree with him. He says that they are second to none. I probably agree with him. But guess what? Every time disclosure laws have been brought into this chamber the Liberal Party of Australia opposed them. From the very first, when they were considered by the joint select committee in 1983, the Liberals fought a massive rearguard action against disclosure. It reminded me of the battle of Stalingrad, as that committee met right through the winter of 1983, and the great Sir John Carrick was the leader of the charge—no disclosure. The Nationals took the same attitude. They even opposed public funding on moral grounds, but they took the money as soon as it was available. In that whole period, from 1983 right up to the present day, every time a government of the day has brought in stronger disclosure laws who is the most consistent body in Australian political history? The Liberal Party of Australia. They have opposed every change the disclosure laws have ever brought into this parliament. Yet the then minister at the table was trying to show some pride in our disclosure laws. What double standards that come from the Liberal Party in this regard! ·	</para><para>Senator Lightfoot has been attacking certain Labor companies in Queensland. The fact is those companies are associated entities. They have put in declarations as associated entities and always have. They have made no attempt to cover up their business activities or their donations to the Labor Party. It has always been in the annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission as to what activities they have been involved in, unlike the Greenfields scam.</para><para>How did Greenfields start? It started off in 1992 when the Liberal Party took a loan from the NAB, and it was verbally guaranteed by Ron Walker to the managing director, Don Argus. Good luck, Don, if you have taken a verbal guarantee off Ron Walker. I can remember an old printing mate of mine who had a very small enterprise, Fretone Press, in the 1960s. He is just one of the many victims of Ron Walker not paying his bills. Unfortunately, that printer has passed away. I would have loved him to be around today to send Ron Walker those bills he never paid. The Greenfields trust was set up and apparently it made a loan of $4.75 million to the Liberal Party, and no interest was to be charged at all. Wouldn't Ron Walker make a great banker—he puts out loans with no interest! Even I might sign up for that one, but I notice that no-one on the other side has volunteered to put their life savings in the Walker bank—I do not blame them. The Liberal Party have made only three $100,000 repayments. So the good news is that in 2043 the Liberal Party of Australia will have paid out the Greenfields loan.</para><para>We got on to this fairly early because there were certain suspicious circumstances. Look at the Greenfields trustees: Tony Bandle, who also happened to be a trustee of the Free Enterprise Foundation, a recognised association entity of the Liberal Party; Sir John Atwill, a former president of the Liberal Party; and, finally, Stephen McAneney, also a director of the Free Enterprise Foundation. The interesting one is Sir John Atwill. When he was asked about Greenfields, what did he say? `I have no knowledge of Greenfields; I have nothing to do with it.' He said this at the very time that he was a director. They obviously kept him in the dark or he was telling some porkies—I do not know which.</para><para>In 1994, the NAB were worried about their loan. They asked to have Robert Menzies House, up the road, given as collateral, so then Ron Walker provided them with a written guarantee in lieu of title. On 5 July, Walker advised Andrew Robb that he had repaid the $4.75 million of the Liberal Party debt to the NAB and had transferred ownership to the Greenfields Foundation. The AEC then wrote to the Greenfields Foundation on 24 December 1997, seeking associated entity disclosure returns. What did Greenfields do? Greenfields through Bandle on 15 January 1998 denied it was an associated entity, citing the objects of the trust deed that limit it in terms of political donations.</para><para>Only when we pressed the issue and the AEC was armed with new powers did they in fact properly investigate this. Then in 1998, the AEC conducted a compliance audit on the federal Liberal Secretariat. They required that an amendment be made to the party's 1996-97 annual return, acknowledging receipt of the money from Ron Walker. Having previously argued that this money came from Greenfields, it was finally revealed that it was Ron Walker that anted up the $4.75 million. What were the Liberal Party ashamed of that they would not reveal him as the donor? Why couldn't they come clean? Why did they have to set up this elaborate apparatus to disguise the fact that Ron Walker had given the Liberal Party $4.75 million, at about the time the casino licence was being expanded in Victoria. We assume the money came from Walker. We have to take his word that it was entirely his money and not, in fact, laundered donations.</para><para>What do we now find? The Liberal Party's debt to the NAB is $158,305. It took enormous pressure from us in this chamber, and then the Electoral Commission, to force more details out about Greenfields. In September 1999, the Electoral Commission wrote to Greenfields, demanding the lodgment of disclosure returns for 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. These were eventually lodged on 11 November last year—but not signed—and under protest from the trustees. The cover-up was still being perpetuated. We need to latch on to those recommendations in the AEC annual returns. They make recommendations about how the legislation can be further tightened to prevent a repeat of the Greenfields Foundation fiasco. ·	</para><para>What reaction have we had from the Liberal Party on the other side? Basically silence. Apart from of course Senator Lightfoot, the eclectic senator from Western Australia, no-one has really tried to defend the Greenfields rort. They are hoping it will go away, that it will blow over, that the press and everyone will lose interest, and that it will just disappear. It is not going to disappear because it is one of the worst rorts in Australian history. Prior to disclosure, the Liberal Party used to be very proud of its code of conduct for fund raising. It used to argue that active politicians never knew where the money came from. The one who blew the whistle on that was Doug Anthony, the former leader of the National Party. In 1972 he relayed his comments to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> by way of complaint that every boardroom he visited had nothing left to give the Nationals because the Prime Minister, Bill McMahon, had been there before him and cleaned them out like a vacuum. It will probably always be that the Nationals will run second—the dopey hangers-on of the coalition, getting into the boardrooms when there is no money left because the Liberals have sucked it all up. But at least Doug Anthony blew the whistle on the code of conduct.</para><para>Today we have had  Senator Lightfoot coming in and saying, `Oh, the Labor Party is not in too good a shape. The Labor Party might even have some corrupt elements in it.' Is this really serious from a Liberal senator? Why don't we have a look at the current state of the Liberal Party that allows things like Greenfields to evolve. Take my home state of Victoria. What wonderful shape the Liberal Party is in there! You have got the Kroger-Costello forces fighting with the acolytes of Jeff Kennett in an absolutely massive feud in that particular state. The state director of the Liberal Party has had to put his cue in the rack—he's off. No-one wants him. He's gone. And guess what? They are struggling to find a replacement using several head hunting firms, but there is a criterion no-one can particularly meet; that is, reform and rebalance the once great Victorian branch. The ones that run the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party are the geniuses that bought us the 1999 Kennett re-election campaign. They were overwhelmingly endorsed at their last state conference. Imagine throwing away the unlosable election, throwing away 10 or 12 regional seats; yet all the Liberal delegates in Victoria march in like a bunch of daleks, put their hands up and return the old crew. The real tragedy of the Victorian Liberal Party is that it once used to return talent to these chambers—House of Representatives and Senate. Who have they got coming through? A lot of time servers sitting in their seats, a total waste of space. The only lights on the hill may be Dr Stone, from Murray, who shows some ability, and Mr Petro Georgiou, the member for Kooyong. All the rest—a total waste of space.</para><para>But if you want to move north of the Murray, is the picture any better? You have the massive battle up there: the right versus the moderates, who are in total gridlock at the moment. They have had to put their party conference off by a month because they cannot get any agreement around the issues. They have total internecine warfare over the Staley report. Imagine the humiliation of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party that they have to bring a Victorian up to do an inquiry into the state of the party. Poor old Sir John Carrick must be extremely concerned about these developments. They have also sacked their state director. Two out of two: Victoria gone, New South Wales gone. Can you imagine anyone putting up their hand for that job in New South Wales? They can't even resolve the dispute between John Fahey and Alby Schultz up in Hume. You have got a cabinet minister and a local backbencher fighting over the same seat, and they can't resolve it. They have appointed Senator Bill Heffernan as the conciliator to resolve matters. He did a crash-hot job in Cook between Stephen Mutch and Bruce Baird. Didn't he do a crash-hot job there? His mission was to save Mutch, who became mulch, and Bruce Baird won the seat. Now he is sent up there. I think it totally unfair to Alby Schultz that Heffernan is sent up there to support him and retain the seat, because he is dead meat swinging in the breeze the moment Senator Heffernan sticks his nose in. ·	</para><para>As well as that, it has spread to their state sphere: a no-confidence motion in Ms Kerry Chikarovski yesterday. She could only win 18 votes to 11. That 39 votes tells you something—you might just think that was lower house members, but I think that is the totality; upper house included—that she could only win that ballot by seven votes. Given the political pygmies that constitute the New South Wales state parliament for the Liberal Party, how could you get only 18 votes? </para><para>Finally, Senator Lightfoot is a bit worried about branch stacking. The member for Wentworth, Mr Andrew Thomson, has referred the Liberal Party membership list to the New South Wales police. Imagine: the Liberal Party's Wentworth party lists assisting the police with their inquiries! That is exactly what has happened up in the seat of Wentworth in New South Wales.</para><para>Both these organisations, Victoria and New South Wales, pale into insignificance when you go north of the Tweed. What a pathetic institution the Queensland Liberal Party are: can't even form a cricket side in the lower house—the only house of parliament in Queensland. You have the Carolyn Tucker factions constantly fighting with each other, always leaking to us so we know the details of what is happening in Queensland before the other factional side of the Liberal Party in Queensland does. Having fitted up Senator MacGibbon in a pretty dubious preselection, it took them 117 days to get our esteemed friend here from Queensland planted on the burgundy seats. Why would it take 117 days? Because the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party is an absolute rabble—that is why. </para><para>Now they have embarked on three-cornered contests. What a magic formula that has been in the past. They have not necessarily done so with the Prime Minister's approval, because the Prime Minister replaced Mr John Moore on the administrative committee that considered this and sent his own enforcer up—none other than our good friend Senator Herron. But he got rolled 23 to 18 on this issue. He goes in and says, 20 times apparently, `The boss wants no three-cornered contests.' What does the Queensland branch do? Gives Senator Herron the big finger. `Go back and tell your boss, “You don't carry any weight here. You're only the Prime Minister of Australia or his representative”.' And you are talking about branch stacking! We must send Senator Lightfoot up to Fairfax so he can examine the branch stacking that has occurred against Alex Somlyay. And let's send him down to Moncrieff where the branch stacking is all to do with getting some young Lib up. And, even better, let's give him a cab right out to Ryan to have a look at all the new members in the Ryan electorate. Talk about branch stacking! I feel like an amateur. I have never stacked a branch in my life, and you can never prove I have because I haven't. But if I want to learn about those techniques I am going north for a holiday for two weeks to have a look at how the real pros from the country club do it.</para><para>I have been very much absorbed at the moment by what is happening on the east coast. Let's go down to Tasmania. They do not have one Liberal member of the House of Representatives. Thanks, Eric. They could only barely scrape together two Senate quotas. Thanks, Eric. And the south and north sections of the Tasmanian Liberal Party are at total war. Thanks, Eric. And, finally, they have a totally ineffective state opposition. Not your fault, Eric.</para><para>Then you go to South Australia. What is the story in South Australia? You have Brown versus Alston non-stop. You have got Senators Hill and Vanstone and Mr Pyne totally at war with Senators Minchin, Ferris and Ferguson.

In summary, the once great Liberal Party of Australia is in a total mess, racked by factional brawling, racked by branch stacking, racked by the fact that on the whole they are returning very mediocre members of federal parliament. Is it any wonder that they cannot inspire fundraising? Is it any wonder that they have to set up foundations like Greenfields and try to hide where their money is coming from?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I agree with a lot of what Senator Conroy said today in terms of Mr Ron Walker. It is not ethical to have the Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party also having close political contact with state and federal governments in which he can be a beneficiary in terms of money. There must be some distance put between the two. So it does not surprise me that the Liberal Party of Australia and Mr Ron Walker went to enormous lengths to disguise his donation to the Liberal Party, probably the biggest political donation made in the history of this country. They successfully disguised that donation for a couple of years. I want to pay tribute to the persistence of Senator Faulkner for continuing to bat on these issues, to expose these issues and eventually to be vindicated. And his final vindication will be when a new amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act is brought into this chamber, carried—hopefully, unanimously—and is proclaimed. That will be a great tribute to the diligence and effort of Senator Faulkner.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>15525</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on this matter of general business.

But the point is that is the art of politics. I do not know whether Senator Ray stood up in feigned shock that all of this was going on around him. He has lived through it in his own party. He has seen it in other parties. There is nothing shocking about it at all.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But one significant point, the real point, that I picked up throughout Senator Ray's contribution was—other than just near the end, when he said he agreed with much of what Senator Conroy said—is that he never really repeated what Senator Conroy said at all, because he has been around too long, as has Senator Faulkner. For all they attacked Mr Walker, they never went as deeply personal as Senator Conroy did. Senator Conroy has erred today. He got a bit of support from Senator Ray, because they are close colleagues. I give a suggestion to Senator Conroy: be very careful you are not set up in regard to personal attacks like this. I get the feeling you have been set up in regard to your contribution today, because—have you noticed?—no-one else in the chamber on your side that has spoken on this matter has made a contribution which is anywhere near as personal an attack as that of Senator Conroy.</para><para>Senator Conroy now seems to want to set himself on a path of being one of the great head kickers in the Labor Party, but he should note that he will be left out there to hang and swing. You will get very little thanks from your colleagues when it comes time for a promotion. Don't think this is your way to the top in politics. Don't think this is the way you get promotion. Don't think you will get the full support of your colleagues. They will slap you on the back as you leave the chamber, but if you ask them to do it, they will not. ·	</para><para>Senator Quirke has been around too long to make that sort of attack. There are ways to do it, and the way it was done today was not the way to do it. The way Senator Conroy presented today was not the way to do it. As Senator Lightfoot said, it was probably one of the worst personal attacks on anyone in this chamber to date. I offer that to Senator Conroy in a friendly gesture. That is not the way to do it, Senator Conroy. You will be left swinging by the very people you are sitting next to now. </para><para>I go back to what Senator Ray was saying about the shock, horror that he put on about branch stacking and preselection battles—all part of politics, some of it worse than others. Senator Quirke, you are up to here in South Australian politics when it comes to a bit of branch stacking—at least turning a blind eye to branch stacking—and to preselection battles. You are a master of it. So let us not pretend either side does not involve itself in this sort of politics. This feigned indignation by Senator Ray has me puzzled.</para><para> Getting back to the general business matter: talk about flogging a dead horse, as they have been in the last several months in regard to Greenfields! General business is a time to debate and discuss policy. This is a lost opportunity—not that the speakers that Labor have had on the list today have ever worried too much about policy discussion and debate and contribution to this chamber: Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray, Senator Conroy. We await the contribution by Senator Sherry but, for those three, policy has never been their strong point. Personal attack has actually been their strong point. In fact, Senator Ray's self-confessed contribution to politics is the personal head-kicking attack. He has it down to a fine art—an art that Senator Conroy ought to study a little closer than he has been doing, because it does not involve the type of attack he brought to the chamber today.</para><para>I take the line that Minister Ellison presented to this chamber: that there has been in relation to the Greenfields organisation no money laundering, no sleazy deals, no breach of law. If you bother to read the report you will see that none of that has been intimated or said or suggested by the report at all. There has been a matter of difference between the Australian Electoral Commission and the Greenfields organisation with regard to their connection with the Liberal Party, and whether it is an associated entity. It is natural that, if Greenfields happen to think that they are not an associated entity, that they present that case to the AEC. The AEC found differently. They informed Greenfields, and Greenfields have acted accordingly. They have now met all the requirements that the AEC have requested of them.</para><para>Anyone who happened to read this <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would think that the whole report was on Greenfields. Greenfields was but a few pages in the report, which is in fact a very good report undertaken after every election. This is not an exceptional report undertaken on Greenfields alone; it is a report undertaken by the AEC after every single election. Several recommendations are made—some very good ones—and no less than two important recommendations in regard to public funding. Rather than being paid out to party agents, there is a recommendation to say that it should be made in the name of the registered party and not the individual. That is a suggestion that I suggest we would support because we know the difficulty that has caused in relation to the One Nation Party. A second recommendation that is worthy of note is that concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of the system for registration of political parties—again relating to the One Nation case. This is an area that needs changing in the law, to tighten it up. These are fine recommendations by the AEC, and that is why the government will be referring the Australian Electoral Commission report in toto to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for a response. That is the process that is being undertaken. I also agreed with Minister Ellison when he made the point that Australia has one of the finest and most rigorous electoral systems in the world.

Senator Sherry is accusing me of wandering. I think everyone has done a bit of wandering in this debate, because it really is a waste of general business time. Senator Sherry, the accusations against Greenfields, it should be pointed out, cannot be made if you do not come to this debate with clean hands—and, as you would expect, the Labor Party do not, as is always the case when they make these sorts of attacks. You talk about shonky deals, but what of the relationship that your party has in Queensland with certain companies such as Labor Holdings Pty Ltd and Labor Resources Pty Ltd? In Queensland, those two companies submit returns, under protest—again objecting to the request by the AEC to submit returns.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But what of the other entities connected to these two main proprietary limited companies? Those companies are Labor Enterprises, New Labor, Labor Legacies and Texberg. They have never lodged returns on their own behalf; yet, just as the AEC inquired into Greenfields, these companies have been deemed by the AEC to be associated entities under the control of the two major entities, Labor Holdings Pty Ltd and Labor Resources. What's more, loans have been made by Labor Enterprises, $3.2 million; New Labor, $61,000; and Texberg, $1.4 million—yet no returns have been lodged by these three companies. Now, explain that. Talk about living in glass houses! Here we have in Queensland a situation not dissimilar to the accusations made against Greenfields. The two major Queensland companies also object to making returns, yet they have been giving loans to companies that have not made similar returns. This is a not a dissimilar situation at all. It shows the absurdity of this debate. You can pretty well be assured that, if this is happening in Queensland, you can extrapolate that sort of structure for every other state, with regard to the Labor Party.</para><para>I would also like to point out that Senator Sherry, who will be speaking next, in a debate not so long ago asked several questions in relation to Greenfields. In fact this has been a very repetitive debate. I have gone through the speeches of the previous speakers today and they have said the same thing over again. Senator Sherry asked: `When will the loan be repaid?' I can ask the same question about the Labor holdings and the associated entities. Senator Sherry asked: `How will it be repaid?' I can ask the same question in regard to the Queensland structure. How is the funding secured and are there any concessional interest rates in regard to the Queensland loan? There are not. And what are the arrangements of the financing? All those questions asked by Senator Sherry in a previous debate can be asked in regard to the Queensland businesses and associated companies. It is almost a mirror image. And what is more, under protest and request from the AEC, those companies have had to lodge a return.</para><para>My colleagues have also raised what is probably the lousiest deal yet, indeed the most corrupt deal yet made in this parliament.

That is $18 more than the rent per square metre for the Chifley Tower in Sydney and the Governor Phillip building in Sydney, which are only $600 per square metre. It is a very small building in Canberra which charges double the rent of any prime real estate in Canberra and $18 per square metre more than in downtown Sydney. What is this place? It is a little building down the road that is the Labor Party headquarters and is occupied by the Australian National Audit Office.

It is interesting that the document refers to a decision of the council in relation to the World Trade Organisation round, and the Seattle outcomes are the next step. I thought that was particularly relevant, given the discussion we have been having in this chamber regarding the dairy industry, given that there has been an inquiry into the dairy industry and given that there has been a lot of comment about the pre-July regime with regard to our World Trade Organisation obligations and the current deregulation of the dairy industry. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to deregulation, there is a proposal at the moment following balloting organised by the Australian Milk Producers Association in the quota states of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. It is interesting to note that that ballot, according to information from the Australian Dairy Industry Council that is now on the public record, only polled 27 per cent of dairy farmers around Australia and, of that 27 per cent, only nine per cent of farmers overall have voted against deregulation. Even that is a pretty appalling outcome for this ballot, given that polling in those states, as I understand it, was on the basis that the regime should be changed so that there would be a system where the farmers in the non-quota states of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania would, in effect, pay out of their benefits under the arrangements tens of thousands of dollars for each farm towards the farmers in the quota states. Is it any wonder that that proposition would appeal to farmers in the so-called quota states? Even given that situation, the fact of the matter is that a very low vote for deregulation occurred. Only about a third of the farmers who actually received ballot papers voted against deregulation.</para><para>I know there are some very desperate farmers at the moment because of proposals on milk prices, and I will deal with that at another time. But doesn't this show how desperate the National Party have become and how, in some states, they are trying to blame state governments for what is effectively an arrangement that was put in place through legislation of this parliament. That is, the restructure package—all the measures which are being put in place and which come into effect, conditional upon deregulation in all states, particularly in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland—is a product of this parliament, and the National Party voted for it. I find it very hard to say anything other than that the members of the National Party have been extremely misleading in trying to blame state governments on this matter because what is being held to their heads, through the legislation of this parliament, is a restructure package which is conditional on those state governments agreeing to withdraw regulation—withdraw the quota system. </para><para>I am sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, would be alarmed if there were a proposal to take tens of thousands of dollars from Tasmanian milk producers to pay milk producers in the quota states of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland on the basis of such an appallingly low vote. While I am on the subject, I note that, while Senator McGauran was making his contribution, I interjected and put to him that the situation is so bad with the National Party that his brother, Mr Peter McGauran, the member for Gippsland, was considering standing aside for Mr Peter Hall, the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the upper house in Victoria. He chose to take that interjection but refused to deny it. It would be interesting to get Mr Peter McGauran's comments on that because there is a lot of interest in how the National Party is going in Victoria, and that will be a barometer of how they see themselves coming out of the next election. The reality is that the National Party will not hold that seat after the next election. ·	</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation: Corroboree 2000—Towards reconciliation</title><title>Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation: Roadmap for reconciliation</title><page.no>15530</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation: Roadmap for reconciliation</title><para>Consideration resumed from 21 June.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>15530</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the documents.</para></motion><para>These are two very important documents because many Australians have recently shown their support for reconciliation by going on marches, whether they were in Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane or even in my state in places such as Rockhampton.

The people who turned out in their masses throughout Australia to march for reconciliation showed that they have a genuine disposition for social justice. It was not just a whim or a fancy but a heartfelt concern. Many of those people have an understanding of what social equity is really about. Many have an understanding of what social justice is about, and they have a willingness to get rid of the past prejudices and baggage that many have held in our society over a long period of time. It is worth while reading two of the short passages from the report, <inline font-style="italic">Corroboree 2000: Towards reconciliation</inline>. The report states:</para><quote><para>Reconciliation between Australia's Indigenous peoples and all other Australians is about building bridges.</para></quote><para>That is something that many people find it hard to do, but it is so important to our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters.

Some of these will be common ground for many Australians; on others there are genuine differences of opinion.</para></quote><para>So, whilst the document recognises that there will be common ground, it also recognises that there will be differences of opinion. It also says:</para><quote><para>The Council had to grapple with issues both widely agreed and controversial in determining its final documents.</para></quote><para>That led to the other document, <inline font-style="italic">Roadmap for reconciliation</inline>. I think the most important thing is the preamble inside the cover. It goes to three specific areas. Firstly, it goes to understanding our history. I believe that many Australians do not understand our history. We have had a distorted view of history presented to us over a long period of time. People of good conscience, people who have a social justice disposition, will understand that. Secondly, it refers to building on the achievements that have taken place on the path towards reconciliation. Thirdly, it refers to our responsibility for the future. I believe that the documents set down a very viable path for people to bridge the gaps that have been created over a long period of time and go towards meaningful reconciliation with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters. I commend both the reports to the Senate and also to the public. I believe they show the way forward and they should be embraced by people with a good social conscience.

Everyone has their own little story or anecdote in this area. Invariably, though, it leads to a focus on high wealth individuals. That is the subject of this report. There is no doubt that those who have the greatest capacity to pay should pay the most tax. I believe that the issues of social equity and social justice are the basis on which tax should be paid.</para><para>If one looks at this report, one can have quite a different view as to the contribution that is paid by the high wealth individuals in our society. These people have invariably searched, with the assistance of a battery of lawyers and accountants, for every which way to minimise their taxation. Paying tax is about being a good corporate citizen, and a good citizen as well. This report highlights a number of the difficulties that have occurred over a period of time which allow people to get away with a number of things. Specifically, I will refer to a number of sections of the report which highlight the moves that have been made by the Taxation Office in identifying the areas where people have in the past minimised their taxation, and I will refer to the steps that have been taken by the Australian Taxation Office as shown in this Australian National Audit Office report. The report started out in the Australian Taxation Office in 1996. On page 18 of the report, paragraph 1.4 states: ·	</para><quote><para>Initial research by the ATO showed that a range of complex tax planning and minimisation practices had been used by some HWIs including:</para><para>·	distributions and loans from trusts—</para></quote><para>and we have heard enough about that in this place—</para><quote><para>·	creation and utilisation of losses;</para><para>·	intra-group arrangements, particularly debt forgiveness;</para><para>·	characterisation of profits on sale of properties by development;</para><para>·	interest deductions relating to property development;</para><para>·	offshore transactions and arrangements;</para><para>·	Research and Development (R&amp;D) deductions; and</para><para>·	alienation of personal services income.</para></quote><para>Those were part of the range of issues looked at by the Australian Taxation Office as being used by people to minimise their income. Paragraph 1.5 of the report goes on to say:</para><quote><para>In May 1996, the Commissioner of Taxation announced that the ATO was developing a comprehensive compliance program to:</para><para>·	act on the unacceptable tax planning and minimisation techniques already identified in the HWI segment of the taxpayer population;</para><para>·	gain an expanded and comprehensive understanding of the tax planning and minimisation practices employed by HWIs; and</para><para>·	continually identify, monitor and address emerging minimisation techniques.</para></quote><para>This is to be commended, because this was a systematic look at the opportunity by those who had advantage in our society to minimise their tax, not to play their role either as a good corporate citizen or as a good citizen by paying the tax that they deservedly should pay. Paragraph 1.6 of the report notes:</para><quote><para>The Commissioner noted that the package of measures to be undertaken would include, as appropriate:</para><para>·	information collection and analysis;</para><para>·	release of rulings clarifying the ATO's view of how the law applied to particular arrangements;</para><para>·	litigation to test the law;</para><para>·	audit and prosecution activity; and</para><para>·	recommendations to the Government on appropriate legislative responses.</para></quote><para>It should be noted that, as a result of activity in this area, there have been legislative responses. There have been definite attempts to take away the chances of those who wish to minimise their tax—quite legally but at the expense of other, ordinary wage and salary earners in our community who have nothing to cling to but the PAYE tax paying scheme. This report has a lot of merit in that it looks at the actions that the Australian Taxation Office has undertaken. Whilst it is a never ending process, it is a step down the right path.</para><para>Page 32 of the report outlines the results of the Australian Taxation Office's examinations to the end of March 2000. It states that they have examined a total of 236 HWIs in great depth. It is worth while looking at just a few of their conclusions. They found that these 236 HWIs were associated with a total of 7,771 entities, including 2,171 trusts comprising 1,116 discretionary trusts, 667 fixed trusts, 31 charitable trusts and 357 where the trust type was unknown. Those are the sorts of minimisation schemes that have been used at the expense of ordinary, average Australian taxpayers. They have shifted the burden to ordinary, average Australian taxpayers who have the least capacity to pay, and those with the greatest capacity have—through various minimisation schemes—shunned their burden.</para><para>The report states that 71 of the HWIs were associated with 10 or more trusts. It states that 60 per cent of these HWIs returned a taxable income of less than $198,000 each in the 1997-98 year. That is because the last full reporting year that the ANAO could look at was the 1997-98 financial year. The report states that 60 per cent of these HWIs each paid less than $40,800 in tax in the 1997-98 year, and the average tax paid as a percentage of the HWIs' taxable income was 20 per cent. One could not, under any stretch of the imagination, say that these high wealth individuals were making even a reasonable contribution to the society. It is not simply the quantum of what they might have been paying; the proportion was clearly out of whack with their social obligations and their obligations as good citizens. ·	</para><para>Time precludes me from traversing the whole content of the report, but I will make this point. The report in conclusion at paragraph 3.65 said:</para><quote><para>The identification and risk profiling of HWIs is on-going. </para></quote><para>That is good news. The report continued:</para><quote><para>The list of HWIs has grown to more than 500. As reported at paragraph 2.44, the taskforce has concluded that, on the basis of its risk analysis activities, a significant proportion (approximately 50 per cent) of HWIs examined require on-going monitoring by the taskforce.</para></quote><para>That just shows the extent the monitoring process is considered necessary by the ATO to ensure that these organisations are not able to avail themselves of tax minimisation schemes and thereby abrogate their responsibilities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>15533</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following order of the day relating to reports of the Auditor-General was considered:</para><para>Order of the day no. 2 relating to reports of the Auditor-General was called on but no motion was moved.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>15533</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Paul (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Calvert)</inline>—Order!

Increasingly, the executive is framing and the legislatures are accepting tax laws where further clarification of the law is required by taxpayers. It is the timeliness, cost and adequacy of these further clarifications that actually need addressing. </para></talk.start><para>Over time, some road guides become available in the form of public or private rulings or through income tax regulations. Very much further down the track, courts add their interpretations. My bringing this matter before the Senate this evening is not to be taken as a criticism of the explanatory memorandums accompanying tax legislation. In fact, the memorandums, with their illustrations and diagrams, are most helpful. I refer honourable senators to the annual report of 1990-91 of the former tax commissioner, Trevor Boucher, which addressed the ATO's links with the parliament and my own involvement. </para><para>Unfortunately, when the black letter law stops so does the explanatory memorandum. This whole area is becoming inflamed with controversy, and in recent times we have seen the Australian Taxation Office come under fire in the rulings area, in particular with a former senior officer facing court charges. The volume of the rulings, both public and private, must be causing logistic concerns for the tax office. I draw the Senate's attention to this three-inch thick bundle of tax rulings which represents just 50 per cent of the rulings that have been issued this week and which have come onto my desk. Fortunately, the centralisation and the improved communications with the revenue office are improving the consistency within the rulings regime. Important as these issues may be, my focus tonight is a little more global. </para><para>The matter of the tax commissioner's discretion arose again this week in reviewing the <inline ref="R1061">New Business Tax System (Integrity Measures) Bill 2000</inline>. The bill is divided into two parts: one dealing with non-commercial losses, the other with prepayment deductions. The purpose of the first part is to limit the extent to which non-commercial losses from an individual's business activity can be used as a tax deduction to reduce the tax paid on other income such as salary or wages. There are five tests, only one of which needs to be satisfied to enable losses from the business activity to be deducted from the income. It is the fifth of these five tests that attracted my attention—namely, the safeguard rule, which is the commissioner's discretion where the business is affected by special circumstances, and they are natural disasters, such as flood, drought or bushfire, or the business is in its start-up phase. So a taxpayer finding himself in test five—the tax commissioner's discretion area—has a dilemma. That taxpayer may await a public ruling, which could take two years to issue, or seek a private ruling. The latter approach is costly in terms of time as well as resources.  ·	</para><para>So the point that I am making to the Senate tonight is that taxpayers need a better system, since rulings significantly lag behind the date the legislation is passed by the parliament. I outlined this problem to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which accepted the thrust of my proposal. Unfortunately, there are no mechanisms for taxpayers to find certainty—and I will use the case of the integrity measures bill—in how primary producers are affected during the start-up phase of the enterprise under subclause 5, because the law is silent. </para><para>This is but one example of dozens of similar measures that cause taxpayers to run to the ATO for some safe harbour protection but, unfortunately, there is none. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, of which I am a member, has liaised with the Auditor-General, who has agreed to report on the administration of the private bindings rulings system. The Auditor-General expects to report next year. Work has also been undertaken by the Taxation Office in an attempt to deliver an enhanced, transparent, robust and credible rulings system. The Auditor-General is, as I mentioned earlier, undertaking a separate inquiry into the rulings system. The point I wish to make to the Senate is that neither of these two inquiries covers the problems of the unacceptable time period which a taxpayer often faces in dealing with questions of grey areas of law or where a discretion is required before the subsequent issuing of rulings, whether they be private or public, or regulations.</para><para>Tax rulings are often detailed and voluminous, as I indicated to the Senate a few moments ago. Taxpayers therefore need a timely mechanism to explain the factors that the tax commissioner will rely upon in forming his opinion in relation to what I call the grey areas of tax law or where the tax commissioner's discretion is needed. There are just too many gaps to provide the degree of certainty that is required in tax law, given the very high penalties that can apply for breaches.</para><para>There is one way to go, that is, to add to the legislation or the black letter law the required information or the road maps. But I would say to you that this would add considerably to the volume of an already overloaded Income Tax Act. The resolution of this issue requires, I believe, the combined wisdom and experience of tax professionals, barristers, the tax institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Australian Tax Office, the Treasury, ministers, parliamentarians and all others who can make a positive input. But the need is urgent because taxpayers need certainty in understanding the law. I thank the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lucas Heights: Nuclear Reactor</title><page.no>15534</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>15534</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night on the adjournment I made some comments in respect of the proposed new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. I particularly drew to the attention of the Senate some of the misleading comments and information that have fallen from the government with respect to this issue. As I have mentioned on a number of occasions, the history of getting information out of this government in respect of this project has been a very tortuous exercise. Often ANSTO and the government have hidden behind that useful device of claiming commercial-in-confidence. Tonight, I want to draw further attention to some of the quite outrageous and misleading statements that have been made by members of the government in regard to this project.</para></talk.start><para>The first one I wish to draw attention to is a letter sent by Senator Alan Ferguson to one of the community organisations, the Australian Local Government Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industry Secretariat. That organisation wrote to all members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works inviting them to attend a meeting on 7 April this year to respond to questions that they had regarding the proposed new reactor. Senator Ferguson wrote back. I have a copy of his letter and I understand that that correspondence has actually been forwarded to other members of parliament. I would like to read this into the record. The letter is addressed to Ms Colella, the campaign coordinator of the organisation. The letter states: ·	</para><quote><para>Thank you for your invitation to address the Australian Local Government Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat meeting on April 7, 2000.</para><para>I and other members of the Public Works Committee have made our position on the new Lucas Heights reactor abundantly clear both in our report and the many speeches that have been made in the Parliament on this issue, and therefore no purpose would be served by me attending the secretarial meeting.</para><para>I would like to point out that the recommendations of the Public Works Committee were unanimously accepted by the 148 Federal Members of Parliament and 76 Senators, including the ALP, Democrats, Greens and Independents.</para><para>Furthermore, based on current sentiment, even if there was to be a change of government, your opposition to the new reactor would not receive any support in Parliament and I feel, therefore, that canvassing the issue further is a futile exercise.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>ALAN FERGUSON</para><para>LIBERAL SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUST-RALIA</para></quote><para>He sent that letter to the organisation on 16 March—that is, prior to the meeting that they had requested he and other MPs attend. The point I wish to draw attention to here is that it is totally untrue for Senator Ferguson to state, as he does in that letter, that the recommendations of the Public Works Committee were unanimously accepted by the 148 federal members of parliament—they are obviously the members of the House of Representatives—and 76 senators including the ALP, Democrats, Greens and Independents. That is just totally false. </para><para>Anyone who cares to recall the debate that occurred not so long ago in this chamber—and if they cannot recall it, they can check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—will know that what happened was that the Public Works Committee report, as indeed happens with all parliamentary committee reports, was tabled in this chamber and a motion was moved on that day by, I believe, Senator Coonan to take note of the report. In the time that immediately followed, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Bob Brown and I spoke and indicated our positions and the positions of our respective parties with respect to this project. There was no vote taken on the recommendations contained in the report. The motion that was carried was the usual procedural motion that the Senate take note of the report. The report was also tabled in the House of Representatives and, in accordance with the requirements of the legislation with respect to authorising expenditure on public works, a motion was moved that the House deemed it expedient to authorise the expenditure in light of the report of the Public Works Committee.</para><para>In the debate in the chamber, Mr Martyn Evans, on behalf of the opposition, acknowledged the fact that the government was the government of the day, it had the numbers in the chamber and, accordingly, the report would be adopted and the motion would be carried. But he also took time—some time—to spell out in detail the many concerns that the opposition has and our position with respect to the proposed new reactor.</para><para>It is a pity that Senator Ferguson is not here at the moment. He is dodging bullets; he is overseas on other important parliamentary business. But I look forward to Senator Ferguson taking the opportunity, when he returns, to explain why he has deliberately misled people by saying that the parliament has unanimously adopted the recommendations of that report.</para><para>I also want to turn quickly to another example of the hypocrisy of members of this government on this issue. The local member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, has gone on public record on a number of occasions in recent months indicating her support for this project. That is her right. Further, she has claimed that there really is no community opposition to this project, that it is all some beat-up by a bunch of obsessed anti-nuclear types in the Sutherland Shire, that people are really wasting their time and flogging a deadhorse and that we should all support this project, which she says is in the national interest and should be located in her electorate. ·	</para><para>I would like to draw attention to a media release that was issued by Mrs Danna Vale back in 1997, one year after she was elected as the member for Hughes. This is what it says—and I will read it into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><quote><para>MP tells Government to “back off” Lucas Heights</para><para>Mrs Danna Vale, the Federal Member for Hughes, has come out and clearly warned her Government to back off any ideas of expansion of the Lucas Heights nuclear facility in her electorate.</para><para>“This is one option which can be crossed off the list here and now,” said Mrs Vale.</para><para>“This reactor itself was built at Lucas Heights 40 years ago when this area was uninhabited bushland. Now, new residential development, over 10,000 new homes, have been built close to the site.”</para><para>“Such residential expansion should never have been allowed to occur if the Government intended to expand this facility.”</para></quote><para>I will interpose here that one of the concerns of people in this area is that, whilst it is often said that people built their houses in this locality with the Lucas Heights facility already being there, there are many people who will tell you that they were told by real estate agents that the current reactor would be closed down early after 2000 and no further reactor would be built. Whether or not those real estate agents were entitled to say that is another matter, but many people bought property in that area on that basis. Mrs Vale, in that media release, then says:</para><quote><para>“As a matter of fact, the community has been under the impression for many years that the reactor itself would be phased down and a new one built elsewhere. Let's face it, Australia is not exactly short of empty open space.”</para><para>“Lucas Heights was never, never intended to be a nuclear waste storage facility or a reprocessing plant. It is far too late for this type of facility, which would require a substantial upgrading of the site.”</para><para>“If we are to continue with a nuclear facility, it is the Governments role to find a suitable site in a safe and responsible location which will take us into the next two hundred years,” said Mrs Vale.</para></quote><para>That was on 5 March 1997. Mrs Vale's position has undergone a change of 180 degrees. The arguments that Mrs Vale outlined in her media release at that time in 1997—about community concern, about increased population and housing in that area, about how people were under the clear impression that this facility would be closed down and that there would be no further reactor built there—are the arguments that are being put by people today. Mrs Vale was claiming then, as she still claims today, to represent the people. The government should listen to the people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Liberal Party of Australia: Tasmania</title><page.no>15536</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>15536</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am sorry, Senator Conroy, that I am delaying you this evening, but I have something to say here that is important for the record. On Tuesday evening in the other place, the member for Denison, Duncan Kerr, made a number of false and misleading allegations regarding the alleged involvement by me and one of my staff members, Mr Brendan Blomeley, in an alleged branch stacking attempt in the Tasmanian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. The member for Denison has mischievously sought to falsely accuse me and Mr Blomeley of being involved in an attempt to undermine the preselection chances of my very good colleague Senator John Watson. Put simply, this accusation is not true.</para></talk.start><para>The false allegations, as presented in the other place by the member for Denison, allege that Mr Blomeley sought to stack branches by offering a sixpack of beer and membership to the Liberal Party for a fee of $5. The membership drive to which the member for Denison refers occurred in late February during the 1998 orientation week on the Hobart Campus of the University of Tasmania—over two years ago.</para><para>At this time Mr Blomeley did not live in Tasmania, was not a student at the University of Tasmania, was not employed by a Liberal member of parliament and was not a member of the Liberal Party. This all occurred before the last election, and I was not a candidate at the last election. In fact, to allege that Mr Blomeley organised a stack which involved the creation of a false branch lacks credibility and any element of truth. For the benefit of setting the record straight, it is im</para><para>portant that the Senate hear the truth regarding this matter. ·	</para><para>As I am aware, the architects of the 1998 University of Tasmania orientation week Liberal membership drive were two members of the University Liberal Club and the Tasmanian Young Liberal Movement, Mr Steven Mavrigiannakis and Mr John Kennett. Both Mr Mavrigiannakis and Mr Kennett, in their enthusiasm, sought to induce young university students to the University Liberal Club and the Young Liberal Movement by making the extremely generous offer of membership and a sixpack of beer for a mere $5. Mavrigiannakis, the then state President of the Tasmanian Young Liberal Movement, and his Vice President, Kennett, held the membership lists of those who joined the party during the 1998 orientation week. From these lists, Mavrigiannakis and Kennett, in an attempt to further increase their standing in the Tasmanian Liberal Party and, more particularly, the electorate of Franklin, transferred the names of these new Liberal student members into Young Liberal branches. Mr Blomeley, at the time of the alleged AGM of the Eastern Shore Young Liberal Branch, was appointed to the position of Acting State Secretary of the Young Liberal Movement. I am led to believe that the two senior office bearers, Mavrigiannakis and Kennett, directed Brendan to sign the Election of Office Bearers form.</para><para>This issue was thoroughly investigated by the State Management Committee of the Tasmanian Liberal Party some two years ago. As a result of this investigation, the record keeping style and management of the Young Liberal Movement was markedly changed to prevent this type of activity occurring again. Two years ago, I played no part in any alleged branch stacking activity, nor am I currently involved in any such activity. Two years ago, this matter was appropriately dealt with internally by the party. I repeat: all this occurred prior to the last election—an election that I was not a candidate for. </para><para>Disappointingly, as a result of what could be best described as a `personality clash' between some members of the Tasmanian Liberal Party, some people have sought to resurrect this issue and, in so doing, attempted to damage careers. In fact, prior to Mr Blomeley being appointed to my office in late 1999, Mr Kennett threatened that if I employed Brendan he, Kennett, would do all he could to ensure that I was not preselected. I, again, would like to place on the record that I played no part in this alleged branch stacking exercise and Mr Blomeley simply did not have the resources to have played an active role in this alleged activity. Further, it is significant to note that as this occurred some two years ago it is plainly obvious that I had nothing to gain. To suggest otherwise would be both mischievous and misleading. </para><para>Duncan Kerr's sleazy attempt to discredit my good reputation and that of Brendan Blomeley is beneath contempt. The member for Denison has misled the parliament and the media. His grubby attempt on Tuesday evening to score a cheap political point under the protection of parliamentary privilege is contemptuous, and I challenge him to make these allegations outside the chamber. If I were Duncan, I would be looking in my own backyard because the word around town is that his preselection is not a sure thing either. This is a classic beat-up by a Labor member who would be better served, in light of the 2,000 ALP members who have been recently expelled in New South Wales for branch stacking, to concern himself with his own future and the future of his own party rather than concerning himself with an internal Liberal Party matter that happened some two years ago.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>15537</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.48 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>15537</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>15537</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Defence Act—Determination under section 58B—Defence Determination 2000/19.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>15537</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 7 June 2000:</para><quote><para>Transport—ARCAS Airlines—</para><para>Copies of documents relating to ARCAS, trading as Air Facilities [9 vols].</para><para>Covering letter from the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government (Senator Ian Macdonald) to the President of the Senate, dated 22 June 2000.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>15538</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care Facilities: Inspections</title><page.no>15538</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1905)</subtitle><id.no>1905</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>15538</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 24 January 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) To date, how many inspections of residential aged care facilities have been carried out by the Standards and Accreditation Agency (broken down by state and month since the establishment of the agency) in carrying out its standards monitoring role.</para><para>(2) How many staff (full-time equivalent) in the agency have been assigned to the standards monitoring role (broken down by state and month since the establishment of the agency).</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>15538</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Since July 1998 there have been more than 1,400 Agency visits including 943 support visits and 84 spot checks.

The Trust funding will also provide fencing for a number of priority wetland sites in that area identified during the mapping and assessment.</para><para>(d) As for other Natural Heritage Trust Bushcare projects, the project application for both these projects, signed by the applicant organisation and approved by the Minister, forms the specifications and conditions.  For both projects, the Commonwealth added a further condition, reducing the fencing rate requested in the application from $2 per metre to a maximum of $1.20 per metre from Natural Heritage Trust funds.  This condition also required that each recipient of funding for fencing sign a management agreement to protect the fenced out areas.</para><para>(e) Environment Australia has received progress reports as part of continuing applications for subsequent years of funding from both these projects and final reports will be required at the conclusion of each project.</para><para>(2) In much of Australia, and Victoria particularly, Bushcare projects are often targeted to privately owned land or those areas of public land where the community takes a custodial responsibility for management.  Specifically, with regard to the tenure of the land.</para><para>(a) Works that are on privately owned land may be funded through the Natural Heritage Trust provided that the landowner agrees to the works and the public benefit of the works far outweighs any private benefit; ·	</para><para>(b) Works that are on land that adjoins privately owned land may be funded through the Natural Heritage Trust provided that the landowner, or the body responsible for the land, agrees to the works and that the public benefit of the works far outweighs any private benefit;</para><para>(c) Works that are on publicly owned land may be funded through the Natural Heritage Trust provided that the body responsible for the land agrees to the works.  However, the Bushcare program of the Natural Heritage Trust does not normally support works on those larger areas of public land and reserves, where vegetation management is the core responsibility of a State agency such as a national parks service.  The public land on which Bushcare projects commonly occur is often closely associated with community owned or managed land and for which the community takes a custodial responsibility for natural resource management;</para><para>(d) Works that are on the boundary lines of two or more separately owned properties may be funded through the Natural Heritage Trust provided that each land owner on whose land the works are to take place agrees to the works and that the public benefit of the works far outweighs any private benefit.</para><para>The key issue considered is not the land tenure but whether the primary purpose of the works is to achieve a strategically important public benefit for natural resource management and that the works are not considered the normal responsibility of the land owner or manager.  A successful Bushcare project may indeed target any of the land tenures listed.</para><para>(3) The Natural Heritage Trust is implemented in partnership with the States and Territories.  Under the partnership, each jurisdiction is responsible for monitoring the community-initiated projects but the Commonwealth assists through a number of mechanisms.  For Bushcare, Greening Australia is contracted by the Trust to give advice to groups on how to implement projects and monitor and report their success. Environment Australia has been advised that the Natural Heritage Trust Coordinator for Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority recently audited these projects as part of the region's grant management program and was satisfied with the level and standard of progress.</para><para>For projects extending over more than one year, progress reports are required as part of the application for each subsequent year of funding and these are reviewed at regional, State and Commonwealth level.  Final reports are required at the conclusion of each project.</para><para>While relying on the States and Territories to generally manage and monitor community projects, the Board of the Natural Heritage Trust initiated its own independent mid-term review of the Trust during 1999.   The Review examined and visited over 400 projects across Australia.  The reports from the review have been published and are available on the Internet at http://www.nht.gov.au/review/index.html. ·	</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
