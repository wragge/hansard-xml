However, the subregulation does not indicate what means the Minister may or must use in making this information publicly available. The Committee also notes that this is in contrast with other provisions in regulations 5, 6 and 7 which require the Minister to publish in the Gazette a notice of a decision about accrediting a Queensland law, revoking that accreditation or limiting the application of an accredited law. It is also in contrast with the comment in the Explanatory Statement, that an accreditation "must be in writing, published in the Gazette, and be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision", a comment which at least suggests that the statement of reasons must be published in the Gazette.</para><para>Paragraph 6(6)(b) permits the Minister to allow the revocation of the accreditation of a Queensland law not to take effect for up to a year after notice of the revocation has been given. The Committee is concerned that this is a long time for a Queensland law effectively to be in limbo, and seeks your advice on the reasons for the provision.</para><para>The purpose of regulation 11 is to allow aquaculture facilities that were operating on 1 October 1999 to continue to operate, without the need to comply with these Statutory Rules, so long as such facilities are not significantly increased in size. The Committee notes that there is no indication, in the Explanatory Statement, of the reason for the date of 1 October 1999 having been chosen. It appears from the Regulation Impact Statement that the intention of the Statutory Rules is to affect only new aquaculture facilities, but since the Regulation Impact Statement is dated January 2000 and the Statutory Rules themselves commenced on 23 February 2000, when they were gazetted, it appears that the Statutory Rules have a measure of retrospectivity.</para><para>By virtue of paragraphs 11(1)(a) and (b), an aquaculture facility that was operating on 1 October 1999 will be liable to the penalties imposed by regulation 9 if there is a significant change to the operation after these Statutory Rules come into operation. The Committee notes that regulation 11 does not provide any definition of what constitutes a significant change, and (subject to the comments made in the next paragraph) it is up to a court to decide whether a change has been significant. The Committee seeks your advice on whether criminal liability should be spelt out more clearly.</para><para>The Committee notes that subregulation 11(5) provides that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority may advise an operator, in answer to a request from the operator, whether a proposed change is significant, and that answer is to be taken, for the purposes of paragraph 11(1)(a) or (b), to be conclusive. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether this provision permits the Authority to oust the judicial function of deciding whether a criminal offence has been committed.</para><para>Regulation 17 permits the Authority to send to the operator of an aquaculture facility a notice requiring the operator to show cause why the Authority should not direct the operator to cease discharging aquaculture waste from the facility. Subregulation 17(1) provides that the regulation applies to a facility which is licensed under an accredited Queensland law, but a law in respect of which the Minister has revoked that accreditation, although the revocation has not, at the time of the show cause notice, taken effect. The Committee seeks your advice on the basis for the Authority stepping in and, at least, requiring an operator to show cause, when the operator is, by definition, complying with the then effective Queensland law. The Committee notes that this regulation must be read with paragraph 6(6)(b), noted above, under which the Minister may postpone the revocation of the accreditation of a Queensland law for up to a year after he or she has given notice of the proposed revocation. </para><para>Paragraph 26(2)(a) obliges the Authority to make a decision on an application submitted by a proposed operator of a new aquaculture facility. The Committee notes, however, that neither that paragraph, nor the remainder of regulation 26, imposes any time limit on the Authority within which it must come to that conclusion. It also appears that it is not required to decide that matter as soon as practicable after it has received all the necessary information. The Committee seeks advice on whether a time limit should be imposed for the consideration of applications.</para><para>Subregulation 39(1) allows the Authority to various kinds of action against an operator if "there is reason to believe that a breach of ... a condition is about to happen". The Committee inquires how the Authority will determine that a breach of a condition is about to happen. In doing so, it should be noted that the Explanatory Statement considers that this regulation applies only "where it appears to the Authority that the holder of a permission is not complying with the existing conditions of a permission."</para><para>Regulation 48 permits the Authority to waive the payment of fees which would otherwise be payable for an application. In making that decision, the Authority nay consider any relevant matter, but there is no provision for the external merits review of the exercise of that discretion. Regulation 51 contains a list of other decisions of the Authority which are subject to such review. The Committee seeks advice on the reason for omitting the decision to waive fees under regulation 48.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>Senator Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator Coonan</para><para>17 April 2000</para><para>Thank you for your letter of 9 March 2000 regarding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000</inline></para><para>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000 ("the Aquaculture Regulations") were also gazetted on 23 February 2000. The purpose of the Aquaculture Regulations is to control the discharge of waste from aquaculture operations which may affect plants and animals in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park ("the Marine Park").</para><para>Sub-regulation 5(7) of the Aquaculture Regulations provides that the Minister must prepare, and make publicly available, a statement of reasons for his or her decision to accredit a law of Queensland. By sub-regulation 5(5), the Minister must publish notice of his or her decision in the Commonwealth Government Gazette and, by virtue of sub-regulation 5(6), an accreditation has effect from the day the notice of the decision is published in the Gazette. It is not usual for a statement of reasons to be published in the Gazette. Publication of the decision will give notice of the decision to the public at large, and then a request for a statement of reasons can be made. Unlike legislation such as the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), a person does not need to prove locus standi to be entitled to a statement of reasons.</para><para>Under regulation 6 of the Aquaculture Regulations, the Minister may revoke an accreditation under regulation 5 where the law no longer provides the requisite degree of protection. Revocation of the accreditation of a Queensland law must be notified in the Gazette (sub-regulation 6(4)) and has effect on the day stated in that notice (sub-regulation 6(5)). Sub-regulation 6(6) provides that the day upon which the revocation takes effect must not be earlier than on the day on which the notice is published and must not be later than one (1) year after the day on which notice is published. Sub-regulation 6(6)(b) provides for a maximum period for which revocation must take effect. This provision does not cause the accredited Queensland law to be in limbo, but rather allows time for administrative arrangements and other steps to be taken so that there is a smooth transition from operation of the Queensland law to operation of the Aquaculture Regulations. In appropriate circumstances, the Minister may decide that revocation should take effect more quickly.</para><para>Sub-regulation 11(1) provides that regulation 9 prohibits the discharge of aquaculture waste from a facility that was operating on 1 October 1999 only if, after that day, the volume of aquaculture waste discharged is significantly increased, or the nature or composition of the aquaculture waste discharged alters in a significant way; "that is, a way that makes the waste significantly more likely to pollute water in a way harmful to animals and plants in the Marine Park, or that makes the waste significantly more harmful to such animals or plants". The operation of sub-regulation 11(1) is further qualified by sub-regulation 11(2) which provides that "an aquaculture facility was operating on 1 October 1999 if aquaculture products were produced in the facility and were sold before that day". Regulation 11 makes reference to "1 October 1999" as this was the date by which the exposure draft of the Aquaculture Regulations had been made available to Industry and other key stakeholders. That is., by 1 October 1999 industry was `on notice' that regulations would be introduced and it is therefore an appropriate `cut-off' date by which to define those facilities in respect of which discharges of waste will not be regulated. </para><para>The Committee is incorrect in stating that there is a measure of retrospectivity in the application of the Regulations. The Regulations would be retrospective if they sought to apply to discharges of waste that occurred prior to the Regulations entering into force. They do not do this. The Regulations apply only to discharges of waste that occur after the commencement of the Regulations.</para><para>In respect of sub-regulation 11(1)(b), the phrase "significant way" is qualified by the words "that is, a way that makes the waste significantly more likely to pollute water in a way harmful to animals and plants in the Marine Park, or that makes the waste significantly more harmful to such animals or plants,". In the case of both subregulations 11(1)(a) and (b), the Authority has developed administrative arrangements for the determination of "significance". Details of these administrative arrangements are available to operators. Operators are able to gain increased operational certainty through contacting the Authority for advice under subregulation 11(4) and seeking copies of the administrative arrangements. Criminal liability for discharging aquaculture waste into the Marine Park without a permission or satisfying one of the other exemptions provided for in the Aquaculture Regulations, is contained in regulation 9. Reference is specifically made to regulation 9 in subregulation 11(1), and sub-regulation 9(2) expressly provides that the prohibition contained in that provision is subject to Part 3. The Aquaculture Regulations already provide operators with sufficient notice of the criminal liability provisions.</para><para>Under sub-regulation 11(4) of the Aquaculture Regulations, an operator of an aquaculture facility mentioned in sub-regulation 11(1) may ask the Authority's advice as to whether a proposed increase in volume, or change in composition, of waste is significant for the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) or both. Under subregulation 11(5), if in reply to such a request the Authority advises the operator that the proposed increase or change is not significant for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) or (b) or both, the proposed increase or change is taken not to be significant. Sub-regulation (5) is a deeming provision and has the effect that, when its provisions are triggered, sub-regulations 11(1)(a) and (b) do not operate to require an operator to have permission to discharge aquaculture waste into the Marine Park. Consequently, there is no ousting of judicial function as there can be no contravention of either sub-regulations 11(1)(a) or (b) or both. The intention behind sub-regulation 11(5) was to provide certainty to operators by allowing them to rely upon the advice of the Authority.</para><para>Regulation 17 applies where the Minister has revoked accreditation of a Queensland law but the revocation has not as yet taken effect. This regulation allows the Authority to serve a notice on an operator of an aquaculture facility seeking reasons why the facility should not be directed to cease discharging waste where the Authority has reasonable grounds for believing that the discharge from the facility is polluting waters of the Marine Park in a manner harmful to animals and plants. This allows almost immediate action to be taken to stop aquaculture waste discharge which may be injurious to animals and plants in the Marine Park without having to delay until revocation of the Queensland law has taken effect. A decision requiring an operator to cease discharge under regulation 17 is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under Part 5.</para><para>For the reasons identified above, it may be necessary to allow some time (up to 1 year) for the revocation of an accreditation of a Queensland law to become effective. However, regulation 17 is necessary to ensure the Authority can take action, in the period before the revocation becomes effective, to prevent discharges of waste that may pollute the Marine Park (even if such discharges are in accordance with a Queensland law that has been assessed as no longer meeting the pre-requisites for accreditation).</para><para>Time limits for the assessment of permit applications and the making of permit decisions are provided for in the administrative arrangements previously referred to. Advice is given to permit applicants within ten (10) days of receipt of their applications as to the level of assessment required. Because permit applications need to be assessed at different levels having regard to environmental risk, it was not appropriate for specific time periods to be specified; that is, discharge from large aquaculture facilities may have national environmental significance and need to be assessed at a higher level than discharge from facilities which pose less of a risk to the Marine Park. </para><para>Sub-regulation 39(1) allows for the Authority to take certain, specified action if. "there is reason to believe that a breach of .... condition is about to happen". The Authority will be able to determine when a breach is about to happen through independent monitoring and disease surveillance which will be a condition of all permits. Monitoring trends that indicate a breach is likely to occur (for example, a disease outbreak is detected in an aquaculture pond and it is likely that these contaminated waters are to be released), the Authority will be able to suspend an operator's permission to discharge into the Marine Park. Once contaminated or polluted waters have been discharged into the Marine Park, it is too late to avoid environmental harm.</para><para>Regulation 48 is consistent with similar provisions in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations 1983 which are also not subject to merits review. The fees payable under the Aquaculture Regulations are minimal having regard to the actual costs associated with the assessment of permit applications and do not in any way represent full cost recovery.</para><para>I trust this letter adequately addresses your queries.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Robert Hill</para><para>8 June 2000</para><para>Senator the Hon Robert Hill</para><para>Minister for Environment and Heritage</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA   ACT   2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>Thank you for your letter of 17 April 2000 providing advice on Committee concerns with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000.</para><para>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1)</para><para>The Committee considered your advice on these Regulations at its meeting today and agreed your response met its concerns.</para><para>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000</para><para>The Committee also considered your advice on these Regulations and would appreciate further advice on three matters.</para><para>First, in paragraph 11(a) and (b) it appears that the determination of what is `significant' is not addressed in the Regulations but by `administrative arrangements'. If this is the case, the administrative arrangements would appear to have the same authority as the Regulations. Accordingly, the Committee considers that it would be more appropriate for such a definition to be contained in the Regulation and not in `administrative arrangements'.</para><para>Secondly, the Committee continues to have concerns with subregulation 11(4). The Committee is of the view that the provision allows the Authority to determine what increase in waste discharge is allowable and therefore deemed not to be significant. Thus the Authority appears to have been given the role of making findings of fact normally resolved by a court. As such, it would appear to oust judicial review.</para><para>Thirdly, paragraph 26(2)(a) fails to impose time limits on action by the Authority. Again, it appears that such time limits are contained in administrative arrangements. As noted above, the Committee considers that these limits should also be in the Regulations rather than the administrative arrangements.</para><para>The Committee would be grateful for your response as soon as possible but before 29 June 2000 when the disallowance motion on the Regulations is due to be considered by the Senate.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>22 June 2000</para><para>Senator Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator Coonan</para><para>I refer to my letter of 17 April 2000 and thank you for your letter of 8 June 2000 requesting further information in relation to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000.</para><para>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000 ("the Regulations") were gazetted on 23 February 2000. The purpose of the Regulations is to protect the receiving environment (plants and animals) of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park ("the Marine Park") from biochemical wastes discharged from aquaculture operations. </para><para>Sub-regulation 11(a) and (b) of the Aquaculture Regulations provides that the phrase "significant way" is qualified by the words "that is, a way that makes the waste significantly more likely to pollute water in a way harmful to animals and plants in the Marine Park, or that makes the waste significantly more harmful to such animals or plants". In the case of both sub-regulations 11(1)(a) and (b), the Authority has developed administrative arrangements for the determination of "significance".</para><para>The term "significance" should be interpreted in accordance with the normal rules of statutory interpretation. This term has been the subject of numerous judicial comment.</para><para>I note that the Committee considers that it would be more appropriate for consideration of "significance" to be addressed in the Regulations. The term "significance" is not specifically defined within the Regulations or the administrative arrangements. Criteria for determining the environmental significance of the impact of the discharge on the receiving zone (that is, the Marine Park) are specified in the administrative arrangements. Copies of these administrative arrangements are available to operators.</para><para>The criteria contained in the administrative arrangements for determining the significance of environmental impacts on the receiving zone must be broad. This is to give decision-makers the capacity to have regard to all the varying characteristics of the specific receiving zone being considered. For example, the environmental sensitivity of the receiving zone may change over time, particularly with regard to assimilative capacity and dilution criteria, and these changes need to be considered on a case by case basis.</para><para>Under sub-regulation 11(4) of the Regulations, an operator of an aquaculture facility mentioned in sub-regulation 11(1) may ask the Authority's advice as to whether a proposed increase in volume, or change in composition, of waste is significant for the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) or both. Under sub-regulation 11(5), if in reply to such a request the Authority advises the operator that the proposed increase or change is not significant for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) or (b) or both, the proposed increase or change is taken not to be significant.</para><para>In response to the Committee's concerns regarding the potential to oust judicial review, I do not believe that this is the case. The conduct of the Authority under regulation 11 will be open to judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1974 (Cth). Furthermore, affected persons (including permit applicants) are entitled to request statements of reasons for decisions under this provision.</para><para>Time limits for the assessment of permit applications and the making of permit decisions are provided for in the administrative arrangements previously referred to. Advice is given to permit applicants within ten (10) days of receipt of their applications as to the level of assessment required. Because permit applications need to be assessed at different levels having regard to environmental risk, it was not appropriate for specific time periods to be specified; that is, discharge from large aquaculture facilities may have national environmental significance and need to be assessed at a higher level than discharge from facilities which pose less of a risk to the Marine Park.</para><para>As noted by the Committee, there is no period specified in sub-regulation 26(2)(a) for the making of permit decisions. This approach is consistent with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations which also does not provide specific time frames for decision-making As a matter of statutory interpretation, there is a requirement for decision-makers to make decisions or take action within a "reasonable period" of time where no time limit is specified by a piece of legislation.</para><para>The concern for the Authority if a specific time limit for the making of decisions is to be included in the Regulations, is that this time limit will need to be calculated on a "worse case" basis. This is to ensure that the Authority has sufficient time to:</para><para>adequately assess the proposal (or refer it under either Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth) or the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) in circumstances where the proposal is likely to have a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area);</para><para>undertake native title notification under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (on the basis of the decision in Harris v Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, a period of twenty-eight days for provision of comment is considered not to be unreasonable); and</para><para>conduct a site inspection to validate information contained in the application. </para><para>I trust

the determination of what is `significant', your advice acknowledges that `[c]riteria for determining the environmental significance of the impact of a discharge are contained in administrative

based on the criteria currently contained in the Administrative Arrangements, which the Committee found to be clear and comprehensive. </para><para>Secondly, with regard to time limits under paragraph 26(2)(a), the Committee considers that it would be appropriate to include a broad timeframe such as `within a reasonable time' for the making of permit decisions.</para><para>The Committee would be

These exemptions include supply through clinical trials, the Special Access Scheme and Authorised Prescribers.</para><para>The resulting exemptions have been very successful in achieving greater patient access to new drugs.  Notification of clinical trials to the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the CTN scheme has resulted in a very marked increase in clinical trial activity in Australia.  From less than 50 clinical trials conducted in 1990 there are now well over 400 new clinical trials notified to the TGA each year. </para><para>The very success of the programs has led to occasional concern.  The nature of notification schemes is such that Commonwealth involvement is minimal.  They rely on certification and approval by medical practitioners and institutions.  Should the processes of approval be less than rigorous, the legislation gives no ability to the Commonwealth to investigate and take action to ensure patient safety.</para><para>The amendments in this Bill will provide additional power to the Secretary to ensure the use, handling and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods is in accord with the terms and conditions applied when the exemption for supply is granted.</para><para>This greater control will be achieved principally through the Secretary's new powers to require persons, to whom an approval or an authority has been granted to supply unapproved products, to provide information about how the goods are used.  It also provides that, should the information provided warrant it, the TGA could audit the processes used to supply the goods, including the conduct of clinical trials.  An amendment also enables the Secretary to release information where necessary, to appropriate authorities in the States or Territories with functions relating to Therapeutic Goods and to medical or pharmacy boards.</para><para>The importance of these amendments is that they do not alter the successful processes already established.  The provisions for Category A patients remain in place with no change to the process.  Category A is the provision that leaves the decision, concerning use of any unapproved products for patients with conditions from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, to the patient and their doctor.  No approval is required from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, just notification of the use.  Similarly the notification of clinical trials, established as the Clinical Trials Notification Scheme, is also not altered in any way.</para><para>Some additional amendments are included to give greater recognition to the role of human research ethics committees in the approval and supply of unapproved products.  The definition of ethics committees is amended.  All ethics committees, in addition to being constituted in accordance with the recently updated National Health and Medical Research Council's (NH &amp; MRC) National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans, must have notified their existence to the Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC, a subcommittee of the NH &amp; MRC).  This will ensure ethics committees overseeing the supply of therapeutic goods have access to documents and guidance of the AHEC.</para><para>A further amendment relates to the granting of an authorisation under Section 19(5) of a medical practitioner to become an authorised prescriber, that is, to supply specified unapproved drugs to a specified class of patients. This process removes the need for individual approval for each patient when doctors are likely to treat a large number of patients with the same condition with the same drug.  The amendment ensures all authorised prescribers will have received the approval of an ethics committee to supply the drugs prior to the granting of the authorisation.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2000 spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANTI-GENOCIDE BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15956</page.no><id.no>S230</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><page.no>15956</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15956</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the <inline ref="S230">Anti-Genocide Bill 1999</inline> and related matters, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>The <inline ref="S230">Anti-Genocide Bill 1999</inline> was introduced into the parliament by Senator Brian Greig of the Australian Democrats. In his second reading speech on 13 October 1999, Senator Greig stated:</para><quote><para>In 1949 this parliament commenced some business that 50 years later remains unfinished. That business was no less than the prohibition and punishment of the heinous crime of genocide. </para></quote><para>Senator Greig is to be commended for drafting a bill that seeks to complete that business by implementing into domestic law the United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, ratified by Australia in 1949. The Polish jurist Raphael Lemkin, who coined this new word for an ancient crime, said in 1944:</para><quote><para>Genocide is one of the most complete and glaring illustrations of the violation of international law and the laws of humanity. </para></quote><para>The French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre has starkly expressed the horrific meaning of the crime in these few words: </para><quote><para>The fact of genocide is as old as humanity. To this day there has been no society protected by its structure from committing that crime. Every case of genocide is a product of history and bears the stamp of the society which has given birth to it. </para></quote><para>It is no easy task to deal, within rational construct of law, with the irrationality that perpetrates this crime. But a civilised society demands that it have adequate, effective laws to punish and prevent acts of genocide. </para><para>Having considered the bill, the committee has accepted, on the weight of evidence before it, that genocide is not a criminal offence in Australia at the present time. The Full Federal Court of Australia has found, however, that, leaving aside the matter of intent, it is possible to make a case that there has been conduct by non-indigenous people towards indigenous Australians that falls within at least four of the categories of behaviour mentioned in the convention definition of `genocide'. The proposition that genocide has occurred in Australia, or that it could occur, forces us to be vigilant in the future. The committee has concluded in its report, therefore, that anti-genocide legislation in Australia is both necessary and timely. </para><para>Australian anti-genocide law should be forward looking, affirming the principle that Australia abhors the crime of genocide and set down clear and certain punishment of its perpetrators. The committee heard compelling arguments from a number of witnesses about the educative role that anti-genocide legislation should adopt as a vehicle that alerts people to, and informs them about, the horror of genocide. The committee believes that a domestic anti-genocide law ought to be a powerful tool in bringing about change in attitudes towards the crime of genocide in all its manifestations. This bill has opened up the path for discussion of the form that an appropriate law should take. We have concluded that, subject to lawful exercise of the external affairs power under the Constitution, there may be merit in examining those additional matters or alterations contained in the bill which depart from the text of the genocide convention. These and other concrete matters should be explored more fully by agencies with the necessary expertise and greater resources than were available to the committee. </para><para>The committee's report indicates the key issues raised by the bill that require further examination. For these reasons, the committee has recommended that the parliament formally recognise the need for anti-genocide laws in Australia and that the bill be referred to the Attorney-General for consideration of the matters identified by the committee in respect of its contents. We have requested that the Attorney-General report his findings to the parliament by 5 October 2000. In conclusion, I record the committee's appreciation for the work put into the development and production of the report by Andrew Endrey, Noel Gregory, Saxon Patience and Deborah Cook, all led by Dr Pauline Moore. I commend the report to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>15957</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, want to take a brief opportunity to speak to the tabling of this report. The fact that genocide is not unlawful in Australia should alarm us all and, as such, the conclusions and recommendations of the committee tabled here today are appropriate. After taking written and oral evidence from a broad cross-section of Australians, the committee has, as a whole, recommended that anti-genocide legislation in Australia is both necessary and timely. As the closing remarks in the report state, in part:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... in January of this year, Australia joined with other countries in signing the Declaration of the Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust. That Declaration, in two of its items, stated: </para><para>We will promote education about the Holocaust in our schools and universities, in our communities and encourage it in other institutions. </para><para>With humanity still scarred by genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, anti-semitism and xenophobia, the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils. </para></quote><para>This view has been enhanced in Australia in recent months by the issues surrounding Mr Konrad Kalejs, the previous US and Canadian court findings against him in relation to war crimes and his current existence here in Australia. This particular case has highlighted the reality that the lack of anti-genocide laws within our shores contributes to our country being a safe haven for war criminals. The committee was made well aware of the existing War Crimes Act but, as was discussed in several submissions, this act applies only to World War II and even then only to European theatres of war.  </para><para>The issue of time and jurisdiction touches on one of the very fundamental questions related to this bill: that of retrospectivity. The bill itself was drafted as prospective legislation; however, the terms of reference for the inquiry allowed for report and investigation into the question of whether retrospectivity ought to be addressed. The committee concluded that Australian anti-genocide law should be forward-looking, affirming the principle that Australia abhors the crime of genocide and set down clear and certain punishment of its perpetrators. This is perhaps the only point on which I would disagree with the committee's findings. As I detailed in my additional comments to the report:</para><quote><para>If Parliaments and the community are to engage in a meaningful discourse about the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide—then it cannot be done in isolation of the historical facts. Indeed to do otherwise, is to condemn the memory of countless peoples and the worst expressions of inhumanity to irrelevance.</para></quote><para>The question of whether or not anti-genocide laws ought to be retrospective drew strong responses from both sides of the debate. Most Holocaust or Shoah survivors and members of Australia's stolen generations and their advocates, amongst others, expressed passionately throughout much of the committee hearings that retrospectivity is essential to allow access to justice. Others felt that retrospectivity would open old wounds and create strong social division. Clearly, there is strong sensitivity surrounding the question of the possibility of indigenous Australians taking claims of genocide against the Australian government and its present and past officials, for the policy of removing Aboriginal children from their parents.</para><para>The report advocates, as I said, that the bill be prospective and not retrospective—a position that will greatly disappoint many people in the community. That became very clear in the committee process and is reflected in this report. However, the majority of those people who presented written and oral evidence to the committee made it very clear that some form of anti-genocide legislation was better than none, a position that I would endorse. It does mean, however, that when this bill becomes law it will not provide access to justice for survivors of the Holocaust, nor for survivors of other crimes against humanity, whether they be from the former Yugoslavia or East Timor.</para><para>In reaching its findings, the committee has expressed the view that domestic anti-genocide law should be a powerful tool in bringing about changes in attitudes towards the crime of genocide in all its manifestations. It became clear during the process that there was considerable misunderstanding and misinformation about the notion of genocide and how it applied. For me, that was particularly emphasised in the submission by the Returned and Services League. As I made very clear in my additional comments, both I and the Australian Democrats found the submission to this inquiry by the RSL to be nothing short of appalling. Far from presenting the committee with considered opinion or relevant information, the RSL submission was little more than vilification. Its argument that gay and lesbian citizens ought to be excluded from anti-genocide legislation is disgraceful, and its refusal to acknowledge that homosexual people were persecuted and slaughtered by the Nazis constitutes Holocaust denial. Indeed, the arguments against gay and lesbian citizens by the RSL were, for the most part, the very arguments that the Nazis used as justification for the murder of gay and lesbian people 50 years ago. Ironically, the vilification of homosexual people by this RSL submission provided the committee, I believe, with the very evidence needed to illustrate that homosexual people have been, and remain, the subject of hatred, myth, misinformation and vilification, which in turn leads to the very dehumanisation of, and violence towards, gay and lesbian people.</para><para>I would make the point, too, that we Democrats were considerably disappointed with the response to this inquiry from the Attorney-General and his department. There was no submission by the Attorney-General's Department to this inquiry, despite the importance and gravity of this particular bill. When the Attorney-General's Department did send two representatives to answer questions to the committee in Melbourne, it sent the wrong people. I do not think that is good enough and, for that reason, I want to express my disappointment that one of the conclusions that the committee has reached and has reported here today in terms of addressing this bill is that the bill ought to be presented to the Attorney-General's Department for another three months so that it can comment on aspects of the bill, particularly as it relates to the expansion of the definitions of those groups of people who ought to be covered by anti-genocide legislation—in particular, definitions of sexuality and disability. My feeling is strong that the Attorney-General's Department ought to have engaged this bill and the committee process which surrounded it, during the period in which that happened and not after. It is fair to say that this bill is now 50 years too late, and a further delay so that the Attorney-General's Department may now participate is really not acceptable. This work ought to have been done during the committee process, and not after, and the delay is as regrettable as it was avoidable. </para><para>In closing, I wish to express the Democrats' passion for the pursuit of the success of this bill. I, too, would like to offer my thanks to Chairman McKiernan for his cooperation and support, and to the tremendous support staff in the Legal and Constitutional Committee offices—most particularly, Dr Pauline Moore, Mr Andrew Endrey, Mr Noel Gregory and other support staff, who all worked very hard and diligently and produced what I find to be a terrific outcome in terms of the exploration of these issues. I wish to place on the record, too, my thanks to the many people who provided the committee with quality reports. There were some superb submissions from people, with an extraordinary depth of academic research and personal passion, and I thank those people too.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>15959</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It needs to be acknowledged that Senator Greig did great work in bringing this matter before parliament, and I join with Senator McKiernan in paying tribute to him. The concept of holocaust grew out of one of the great horrors of human history. For me to attempt to describe the awful slaughter that the Nazis undertook during the Second World War would be inadequate. Many people have attempted to talk of that in a way that would meet the horror, but I think it has never quite been done. It is not only the Jewish people who were affected. There is no doubt that the Nazis made a calculated attempt to eliminate Jewish people from the world. I saw on the television the other night a session about the Romanies, the gypsies, of Europe. They were likewise afflicted, as were homosexuals, of whom Senator Greig has spoken. </para></talk.start><para>So this is a timely bill, and it is one in which the groups included have been expanded. The bill makes it a crime for any group to be attacked and eliminated as a group. When I say `any group', I should confine that a little bit: specified groups. I use the word `any' in the sense of groups wider than we originally may have thought. People have said, `This would never happen in Australia', but it is interesting to look at the definition of groups in the bill that Senator Greig has brought forward and to look at that against what has happened in Australia in the past. The issue with the indigenous race has been spoken about but, interestingly, the other group which fits within the definition put forward by Senator Greig is the Communist Party of Australia. You would know if you were alive in the fifties, Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell—but I do not think you were—that at that time there was an attempt to suppress a political party in Australia. It was the only occasion I can remember of a political party being put under lethal attack and an attempt being made to eliminate it.</para><para>An act was put through this parliament which abolished that political party. A case was taken in the High Court, and it was fought by, amongst others, Mr Ted Laurie, a most outstanding counsel at the Melbourne bar and a famous figure, both on the sporting field and in the courts of law. As I was listening to the evidence given in reference to this bill, it struck me just how careful we have to be, as a nation, to ensure that we do not in any way suppress parties or groups that may be vulnerable. The great statement of liberty is that we should support everybody who stays within the law and never try to suppress free speech or those who disagree with us. The very essence of this place is to have debate so that the wisdom of everybody comes across; so something comes across in the sense of being available to the community as a whole. They are very interesting points to think about. </para><para>I think this is a bill which, as the two previous speakers have said, will act as a ferment to further legislation which will, hopefully, come before this chamber, and at that point we can have further discussion about the matter.

First of all, I put on the record my thanks to the secretariat for bringing us through what has been a very difficult process—not because the senators are difficult but because there were various opinions on this issue and we wanted to make sure that all of those opinions were recorded and treated fairly. So I give my thanks to Robina Jaffray and Andrew Snedden, who certainly helped to see us through, and especially to Trish Carling, who did an excellent job. I believe we have produced a report which will be read with great interest and will still be argued over, to a great extent. I do not say that we have actually solved all of the issues. There is some agreement in the report about the issues which are outstanding, and I hope that some division between the Labor Party and Liberal senators is also clearly recorded. I found myself in the middle or on one side or the other at different times.</para><para>Some critical issues have been raised in this report. One of those critical issues is the vexed question of consultation. In every inquiry in which I have been involved one of the points of debate is always the issue of consultation. By and large, I think the Brisbane Airport Corporation fulfilled the requirements of the act with regard to consultation. Nevertheless, there was—and still is—significant public controversy. Part of the problem is that governments need to address this issue of consultation. When we use the word `consultation' to describe a particular action of government people hear that there is a two-way process happening. I think the normal meaning of the word `consultation' suggests that there is a possibility of both sides supplying information and on the basis of that information both sides consulting and maybe changing their opinion and so on.</para><para>I think when governments use the word `consultation' they really are thinking about supplying information. They are not necessarily wanting feedback on that information nor necessarily wanting to change their opinion; they are simply wanting to say to people, `We have consulted, because we have given you the information about the decisions which have been made.' I think that is where the problem occurs. It is a misunderstanding on the part of those who hear the word `consultation'. All governments and all of us probably need to do a lot of work on this issue. We have suggested that perhaps the act should be amended to provide guidelines—or, if the act is not amended, governments themselves should work very hard on guidelines which would enable people to understand what consultation means. While that would not resolve conflict when people disagree strongly with a decision which has been made, it would nevertheless make it much clearer to people what is meant by the word `consultation'. </para><para>Another issue which arose and was mentioned in almost every submission was the problem of noise. But the issue, of course, with noise is that all of the evidence really relates to the current runway, not to a future runway. So we have suggested that the minister himself, along with other people, really needs to do something about this. The noise from the current runway is a problem, and the government has to give some attention to that. I noticed that yesterday there was a media comment—I think it was a comment in AAP—that new flight paths had been agreed to and, apparently, that may obviate some of the current problem. I hope so. That is certainly something which must be addressed.</para><para>The third point I want to draw attention to, because I do not want to spend a lot of time on the report, is that there is a need to amend the master plan, or perhaps to produce a new master plan, because the master plan currently speaks about a parallel runway, and the proposal presently before us really is for what would be better described as a staggered runway. So I draw attention to that. That is all I want to say, because I know my colleagues want to comment further. I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para>The tabling statement read as follows—</para><quote><para>RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRAN-SPORT REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE DEVE-LOPMENT OF THE BRISBANE AIRPORT CORP-ORATION MASTER PLAN</para><para>Terms of Reference</para><para>On 23 August 1999, the Senate referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee an inquiry into the Development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan for the future construction of a western parallel runway, with particular reference to:</para><para>(a)	whether the Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) failed to adequately investigate all runway options, including the adequacy of the BAC's methodology for evaluating runway options, including the economic, social (for example, comparative numbers of households affected by noise), environmental, public health and public safety impacts of each;</para><para>(b)	whether the BAC failed to release flight path information to the community and, if so, why;</para><para>(c)	the role of Airservices Australia and any conflict of interest which may exist between its BAC consultancy role and its obligation to provide advice to government;</para><para>(d)	the adequacy of public consultation undertaken by the BAC;  and </para><para>(e)	why the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (Mr Anderson) proceeded to endorse the BAC Master Plan.</para><para>The Committee's inquiry into the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan required detailed consideration not only of the Master Plan itself, but also of the legislation under which the Brisbane Airport Corporation, and other airport owners, operate. </para><para>The focus of the Committee's deliberations included the requirements under the<inline font-style="italic"> Airports Act </inline>1996 for master plans and stakeholder consultation and the actual consultation undertaken by the Brisbane Airport Corporation.</para><para>During its inquiry, the Committee considered the following major issues:</para><para>the requirements of the Airports Act as they relate to the development of an airport master plan, including the purpose of airport master plans and major development plans;</para><para>the consultation process required by the Airports Act;</para><para>the consultation process undertaken by the Brisbane Airport Corporation in developing the Master Plan and the approval process for a draft master plan under the Act; and </para><para>issues in relation to runway options and the provision of information on flight paths and the role played by AirServices Australia in the preparation of the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan. </para><para>The Committee identified a number of major problems in relation to the master planning and related processes, including:</para><para>the uncertainty surrounding the primary purpose of an airport master plan and the differing views in the community about the purpose of master plans;</para><para>the lack of understanding about the master planning and major development planning processes; and</para><para>the significant debate amongst sections of the community about the legal status of the Brisbane Airport Master Plan.</para><para>This last matter was the subject of legal advice to a number of parties involved in the inquiry, including the Brisbane Airport Corporation, the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services and the Committee itself.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Limitations in the Airports Act 1996</inline></para><para>The Committee considers that the difficulties experienced in relation to the planning and consultation processes undertaken in relation to the Brisbane Airport Master Plan have arisen in part because of limitations in the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline>. These limitations include:</para><para>the lack of a statement of purpose for both an airport master plan and a major development plan;</para><para>the lack of definition and information about the interrelationship between an airport master plan and a major development plan; and</para><para>the lack of prescriptive information regarding consultation requirements generally, and of appropriately structured processes for conducting appropriate community consultation.</para><para>The Committee notes that under the Airports Act, an airport master plan is a planning document designed to identify the options for future development at an airport. However, the Committee is particularly concerned that the Act is silent on a purpose statement for an airport master plan. One of the major deficiencies of the Airports Act, in fact, is that it does not state the precise purpose and impact of a master plan, but leaves it open to interpretation. The absence of such a statement has led to significant confusion within the community and stakeholder groups about the purpose and status of airport master plans.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Consultation under the </inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline></para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline> sets out the requirements for public notification and consultation on the draft master plan and recognition of comments received. The Brisbane Airport Corporation undertook a number of processes to inform residents and stakeholders about the draft Master Plan, including public meetings, newspaper advertisements, the establishment of an information line and website and mobile displays.</para><para>The Brisbane Airport Corporation received over 4,000 submissions on the preliminary Draft Master Plan, principally expressing concern about noise levels. Much of the criticism centred around existing noise levels, but some criticism of the amount of information provided by the BAC and the extent to which the corporation had investigated alternate runway options was also evident.</para><para>The Committee notes the Brisbane Airport Corporation has undertaken a re-structure of its Brisbane Airport Environment Committee [BAEC] to enhance cooperation between the airport and the general community.</para><para>The Committee notes the consultation process undertaken by the Brisbane Airport Corporation with government, local industry and tourism organisations. Notwithstanding the actual consultation that took place, there was a strong community perception that the consultation with the public had been inadequate.  The Committee considers that the Brisbane Airport Corporation conducted the public comment phase of the planning process in accordance with the requirements of the Airports Act. However, the Committee considers that, while minimum consultation arrangements are prescribed under the Act, there is nothing to prevent more extensive consultation from taking place.</para><para>The Committee is of the opinion that there is a community responsibility on the Brisbane Airport Corporation, as a responsible corporate citizen, to undertake meaningful consultation with the community so that affected groups and individuals can make informed judgements. The Committee does not accept that it is responsible or desirable corporate behaviour to limit consultation to the minimum required under the legislation.</para><para>The Committee considers that it would raise public faith in the BAC if the Corporation was to demonstrate willingness to go beyond the minimum legislative requirements to meaningfully consult with and consider the public as it proceeds with airport development. The Committee further notes that one of the principal deficiencies in the consultation process experienced by the local community was the failure of the BAC to advance to the community a proper, comparative analysis of the various runway options. The lack of this information (including comparative ANEF maps and draft flight paths) impacted on the community's ability to make a properly informed comment to the BAC and the Minister on the impact of the Corporation's preferred runway option. </para><para>As noted above, the Committee considered the difficulties experienced in relation to the planning and consultation processes undertaken in relation to the Brisbane Airport Master Plan have arisen in part because of limitations in the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline>.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Runway options and aircraft noise</inline></para><para>Runway options at Brisbane Airport have been the subject of ongoing investigation since planning for the new Brisbane airport commenced. Alternate runway proposals mean changes to aircraft noise patterns.  Aircraft noise over built up areas is a sensitive issue and one which all airport owners and/or lessees must be mindful of, particularly where further development is anticipated. The concern expressed by residents about the Master Plan in general and the runway options in particular, underlines the importance of full consultation on development options.</para><para>The issue of aircraft noise underlines the importance of full and open public consultation of matters relating to airports and especially of runway options, which are likely to have an impact on noise patterns and noise levels.</para><para>The Committee notes the volume of evidence given to the Inquiry about noise from the existing runway and recommends that this be addressed by the Minister. A noise amelioration program, similar to that announced by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services for Sydney Airport, should be considered.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Role of AirServices Australia</inline></para><para>There appeared to be a community perception that AirServices Australia had a conflict of interest in providing advice to the Brisbane Airport Corporation as a consultant and then having been required to advise the government on technical matters associated with the master plan.  While the Committee found that there was no actual conflict of interest it remains concerned that the potential for the perception of a conflict of interest is there, given the varied nature of AirServices Australia's responsibilities under its legislation and its commercial operations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendations</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para>1.2	That the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline> be amended to include an object and purpose statement for airport master plans.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para>1.3	That the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline> be amended to specify the relationship a major development plan has to a master plan.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>1.4	That the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996 </inline>be amended to include more prescriptive requirements for community consultation by airport owners and airport-lessees.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>1.5	That the Department of Transport and Regional Services develop a set of protocols which outline the requirements for community consultation in relation to airport master plans and major development plans.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5</inline></para><para>1.6	That Brisbane Airport Corporation conduct more open consultation with affected groups, including community groups.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6</inline></para><para>1.7	That the <inline font-style="italic">Airports Act 1996</inline> be amended to place a responsibility on airports to disclose draft flight path information prepared by AirServices Australia to the public as part of draft master plans.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7</inline></para><para>1.8	That Brisbane Airport Corporation investigate different community consultation models in order to identify the various ways in which more effective community consultation can be conducted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para>1.9	That the dual roles of AirServices Australia of government adviser and external consultant be critically examined to determine whether there is potential for conflict of interest.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>15964</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not speak for a very long period, but I also wish to add to the comments of Senator Woodley. I think it is fair to echo his comments that in fact this report does bring to a close what has been an interesting inquiry—probably like the Chinese curse, `May you live in interesting times.' I would also like to acknowledge the work of the secretariat in assisting us in relation to the inquiry and preparing and negotiating the final report and of course echo Senator Woodley's comments in relation to Trish Carling, Robina Jaffray and Andrew Snedden, who were very helpful indeed in relation to this. I would also like to thank—and obviously Senator Woodley cannot do this himself—Senator Woodley, whose guidance and patience I thought were very important and critical in bringing together a report which was quite complex, given the issues and the strength of feeling involved and the rather lengthy gestation period. I think Senator Woodley asserted—and I have no reason to disbelieve him—that this has been going on for many years and is not simply a recent issue. </para></talk.start><para>There are a couple of areas I would like to briefly touch upon in relation to the report. Firstly, I was struck, as were others, by the strength of community concern in relation to the Brisbane airport master plan. That was illustrated by the range of community submissions that we received. It was also illustrated by the more than 200 Brisbane residents who attended the public forum on Tuesday, 16 November, which was held in the afternoon. We in politics know that if you are staging a public meeting at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and you get 200 people, it is not a political exercise. That is an echoing of genuine concern in the community. I would like to use that to refute some of the allegations that have been made by the government in relation to this matter. At the forum we heard first-hand about residents' experiences of aircraft noise and the concerns that they had about the public consultation during the development of the master plan. </para><para>I would like to thank, on my own behalf and on behalf of members of the committee, the community groups which gave an enormous amount of time in appearing before the committee and preparing written submissions. I would like to make special mention of Ban Aircraft Over Residential Brisbane and their president, Ms Jackie Can; the Sheldon Group; Mr Damien Cronin and the Hipwood Road residents; and Mr Barry Wilson and the Rivermouth Action Group. I would also like to acknowledge written submissions from the following individuals and community groups: Ms Mel Flesser, the Ang-lican Church Grammar School, Ms Sue Pook,Mr Laurie Jeays, Mr Arthur Pierce, Saints Peter and Paul's School, Nudgee Beach Progress Association, Councillor Kim Flesser, Nudgee Beach Residents and Supporters, Mr Joe Fagan, Mr Neil Roberts MLA, Mr James Lindley, the Brisbane Airport Environment Committee, Bulimba State School P&amp;C Association, Cannon Hill Anglican College and Lourdes Hill College. </para><para>There was an awful lot of claim and counterclaim about the alleged politicised nature of this inquiry. It was alleged by one witness in particular that it was a waste of the Senate's time and resources, and this particular group found it outrageous that taxpayers' money was being spent to investigate this. I am sure my colleague Senator Quirke will remember that witness only too well. I would like to refute those allegations. The Senate and the parliament of Australia have a role in investigating the concerns of people in the community. That is our job. It is relatively difficult these days to come up with many community issues which do not involve a number of competing interests and differing points of view. One thing the Senate can do, and it does it well, is to provide a forum for Australians to raise concerns directly with the elected representatives of the people. </para><para>You just need to look at the level of support for this inquiry to see how the Brisbane community jumped with alacrity at the chance to have their say on this issue and the future of the airport. It is easy for the big end of town to influence decisions through PR consultants and big advertising campaigns, but it is a lot more difficult for members of the community to have access to those sorts of resources in terms of influencing governmental and other decisions. </para><para>I would like to acknowledge the intestinal fortitude and the tenacity of the two federal members involved: the member for Lilley, Mr Wayne Swan, and the member for Griffith, Mr Kevin Rudd. Their job is to represent the views of their constituency, and I suspect that, if the shoe were on the other foot, people from the other side of the chamber would be making exactly the same point. As Senator Woodley has pointed out on manyoccasions, this is not a new issue. This has been going on for many years. Representations were made to the members and they represented the views of their constituency. That is what we do as members of parliament, and I think it is fair to acknowledge the efforts and the tenacity of those individuals—and perhaps one in particular in this matter. I think they did a great job in standing up for their communities and sticking with what is an extremely complex issue.  </para><para>With regard to the report itself, I would like to point to the areas where Labor senators have disagreed with the majority. I have to say that, given the complexity of the issue, they were not legion. Firstly, the Brisbane Airport Corporation, in our view, did not conduct a proper public comment phase in the planning process. This goes to the issue of the responsibility of the Brisbane Airport Corporation in its corporate citizenship. This is a corporation which stands to profit significantly from an expansion of the airport, and we are of the view that there is a wider responsibility to hold meaningful consultations with the community so that affected groups and individuals can make an informed judgment. </para><para>Labor senators on this inquiry did not accept that it is responsible or desirable corporate behaviour to limit consultation to the minimum required under legislation, particularly when that legislation appears clearly deficient in the area of specifying open consultative requirements. I think this is something Senator Mason and I could agree on. I say that in the full knowledge that this act was initiated by a Labor government, but time moves on. As Senator Woodley has said, the issues these days are complex, and I think that people are much more aware of their own capacity to influence decisions and much more demanding of the political process, and so they should be. I think it is about time that governments of whatever persuasion looked at the nature of consultation and, as Senator Woodley said, ensure more of a two-way street, particularly when big corporations are involved. The BAC is not alone in this type of attitude—another good example would be the banks.</para><para>Secondly and finally, I would like to reinforce the findings of the report that there need to be some further refinements of the Airports Act to address some of the areas of concern, again acknowledging that it was a Labor initiated act, supported by the now government. Many of the problems and complaints surrounding the master plan process could have been avoided with a more detailed set of requirements. I think this government and any prospective governments, of whatever complexion, should take this on the chin—and I say that in the full awareness that we may be in government in the not-too-distant future. </para><para>The main areas needing attention are those of public consultation and the relationship between a master plan and a major development plan. I hope that, with some goodwill from the government, many of the problems identified in this inquiry can be dealt with adequately in the future. In conclusion, I would like to say that Senate inquiries are not there to serve particular interests relating to the minima of an act but rather to provide a forum for people to have their say, and I think this is something the Senate does very well. I would like to thank all the senators for their assistance in the difficult circumstances of what was really a very good inquiry, particularly Senator Mason, my colleagues, Senator Woodley, and, of course, Senator Parer, who was on the inquiry at that point.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15966</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I first thank my Senate colleagues, who all suffered different pressures and burdens along the way and, particularly, the chairman and the secretariat, who did a terrific job in quite difficult circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>In late August last year, the Senate referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee the matter of the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan. That master plan, which was approved by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in February last year, foreshadowed, in general terms, plans for a new parallel runway to be constructed at some point in the future to ease air traffic congestion at Brisbane airport. The concept of a new runway is not new; it was included in the plans of the Brisbane Airport Advisory Committee as early as 1971. It was again foreshadowed in Brisbane airport's first master plan in 1983 and has been a part of subsequent master plans ever since. For almost 30 years, the parallel runway was an uncontroversial part of the proposed development of Brisbane airport; it attracted little attention. This all suddenly changed in the run-up to the 1998 federal election when Mr Kevin Rudd MP, federal member for Griffith, and Mr Wayne Swan MP, federal member for Lilley—then Labor candidates—started a campaign to dissuade the Minister for Transport and Regional Services from approving the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan, which, again, included the proposal for a parallel runway. </para><para>So what changed to suddenly make the parallel runway a controversial issue in the south-eastern and north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane after almost 30 years of silence? Well, the evidence from Mr Rudd and Mr Swan was that what changed was the terms of the Airports Act 1996. In essence, the argument ran, the master plan, which until this time had simply been a planning document, had now become a document which bound the government. According to Mr Rudd, this change in the legal status of the master plan set in concrete the development of a western parallel runway without giving affected residents sufficient input into the decision. Let me repeat: the primary justification for this entire inquiry lies in Mr Rudd's and Mr Swan's assertion that the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan determines the issue of runway development at Brisbane airport.</para><para>But their interpretation of the Airports Act is wrong and has been clearly demonstrated to be wrong. It is wrong for two very simple reasons. First, the master plan itself is a very general planning document, and the actual construction of a runway requires preparation of a major development plan. A major development plan entails its own very detailed and comprehensive consultation and assessment processes. Secondly, and much more importantly, the master plan itself can be amended if the need to do so arises. In either case, the residents of areas directly affected by the development will—indeed, must—be given ample opportunity for further input. Mr Rudd was notified as early as December 1998 by Minister Macdonald, and subsequently Minister Anderson, about the correct interpretation of the act. No legal advice has been either tendered to the committee or obtained by the committee that accords with the views expressed by Mr Rudd and Mr Swan as to the legal status of the master plan. None. On the contrary, the legal advice obtained by the Department of Transport and Regional Services from the senior general counsel of the Australian Government Solicitor, and by the Brisbane Airport Corporation from Mallesons Stephen Jaques, and presented to the inquiry, as well as legal advice obtained by the committee from Emeritus Professor Denis Pearce, clearly contradicts the selective presentation of the law by Mr Rudd and Mr Swan. While Mr Rudd's and Mr Swan's understanding of the master plan under the Airports Act is incorrect, that is not really the issue. We all make mistakes, you might say.</para><para>The issue is why a former Director-General of the Queensland Cabinet Office and a former secretary of the ALP propounded their view in numerous articles and letters to the community and constituents without adequately checking on the legal status of the master plan. Mr Rudd never took the time to seek advice to check what he himself stated in his own evidence before the committee was the radical change in law underlying his entire public campaign and this Senate inquiry. His actions in continuing to promote to the electorate his own personal opinion, without apparently obtaining any independent legal advice to check its accuracy, are less than might be expected from a responsible member of parliament. It was reckless to demand an inquiry to resolve an issue that would have been settled for him by any competent lawyer, had he chosen to seek legal advice. The resources of the Senate and the committee, both financially and in terms of time, have to a large extent been wasted in this crude political exercise. Mr Rudd's and Mr Swan's campaign seems even more ironic in light of the fact that the Airports Act was originally drafted by the Labor Party, as my colleague Senator Mackay mentioned. While it was enacted by the coalition government after coming to power in 1996, I think we would all agree it was done with the complete support of the Labor opposition; there would be no argument there. </para><para>The act itself is working. There is no evidence whatsoever of any confusion from the people directly connected with preparing and implementing the master plan: the Brisbane Airport Corporation, the department, the planners and the legal advisers. There is also no evidence of confusion from any of the other seven Australian cities, including Melbourne, Perth and Townsville, where airport master plans have been prepared over the last three years in accordance with the Airports Act. The only place where there seems to be problems is Brisbane. The only people who seem to be confused are Mr Rudd and Mr Swan, and of course the people they have misled.</para><para>It is sadly clear that this has been, from start to finish, a purely political exercise. The issue was manufactured, perhaps cleverly, in the run-up to the 1998 federal election and deliberately confused with issues of existing aircraft noise. A Senate inquiry was launched, and throughout all this Mr Rudd failed to exercise his duty of care as an elected member of parliament. He did not check the law once. We have had public meetings, fear and confusion, a major election issue and a Senate inquiry all based on an unfounded and unchecked legal assumption. Mr Rudd, why didn't you check? You received ministerial advice that your position was wrong and misleading. Why still didn't you check? Have you spoken to your shadow transport minister, Mr Ferguson? Have you spoken to Mr Brereton, who, over four years ago, drafted the act? Have you spoken to the Labor Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Councillor Jim Soorley? Will they come out and support you? Will they back you up? Will Mr Swan back you up? I know he has gone silent on this issue all of a sudden. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have merely succeeded in fomenting public dissatisfaction for their own political ends. By sowing confusion in the community, they have caused fear and uncertainty to rise and the property values in their electorates to fall as people needlessly worry about the hypothetical impact of airport development on their homes. In the end, the construction teams are not ready to move and will not move for quite some time. The concerned residents will be given ample opportunity to put their views across when the major development plan is being considered.</para><para>This inquiry has achieved little for the residents of the electorates of Griffith and Lilley. Labor started this inquiry, and now the inquiry has come back to haunt them. The legal underpinnings of their case have been proven false and have been knocked out. What is left? Not very much, except over 100,000 residents of Griffith and over 100,000 residents of Lilley who have been misled. One thing is for certain—they will not learn the full truth of this from their elected representatives. If this is what goes for credible and sensible political representation, then the electors of Griffith and Lilley have been badly let down by people in the highest positions of public trust.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>15968</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not take up too much of the Senate's time today, but I must say that Senator Mason has provoked us.

I went through this inquiry, as people know, and I think the BAC went out there and did its best with what it interpreted to be necessary under the act. I think the BAC is concerned about what is happening. Obviously, it has an airport to run. It has purchased an airport, it has to make it function and that is fine. What the people around that airport want is someone who is sensitive to their issues. What they do not want is someone who has been around for five minutes or a Bombay lawyer to get up and start saying what the best legal advice is and how you should not do anything before you run around to your lawyer. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84M</name.id><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator Mason</name></talker><para>—Why didn't Mr Rudd check the law?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name></talker><para>—I listened to you quietly; now you listen to me.

Senator Mason may learn that lesson eventually; I am not sure that he has in this exercise. But I will say this: Senator Mason has made it crystal clear where the line of divide on this issue is. If you care about the things that are happening at Brisbane airport, you will support the representatives who take you seriously and not someone who gets up on a soapbox, starts making callous and, dare I say, rather elitist remarks and suggests that you ought to go down and consult your lawyer before you do anything. I do not think that is going to go down too well. I will also say this: I am not normally as provocative as this, but if somebody comes in here and wants to attack other representatives for doing their jobs as they see fit then they deserve it.

This is a generic anti-avoidance clause. The amendments have the effect of prohibiting datacasters from providing Internet carriage services where they have been determined by the ABA to be `declared Internet carriage services'. Concerns have been raised that the provisions of the bill may have had the unintended effect of allowing datacasters to use Internet carriage services to provide point-to-point broadcasting services, thereby circumventing the intent of the datacasting provisions. </para><para>The bill currently allows datacasters to provide an Internet carriage service which is exempt from the genre rules. The policy intention behind this is that datacasters should be able to use their spectrum to allow users to have direct connections to the Internet, without the datacasting licensee being legally responsible for the nature of any content accessed and downloaded privately by individuals. However, this exemption does not apply where a datacaster selects and copies content from the Internet and provides it to users, thereby assuming responsibility for the nature of that content. It has been suggested that the Internet carriage provisions in the bill as drafted could have the unintended effect of exempting a point-to-multipoint broadcast service, where such a service was provided as an Internet carriage service by the datacaster. This could provide a mechanism for a datacaster to provide a high quality broadcasting service while avoiding the genre restrictions. </para><para>The amendments provide a mechanism that gives the ABA a broad power to take action should this occur. It inserts new anti-avoidance provisions in schedule 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which establish the concept of a declared Internet carriage service that is not allowed to be provided by a datacaster. The ABA can declare a service to be a declared Internet carriage service where the service is a service provided by a datacaster as an Internet carriage service, but where one or more persons enter into, begin or carry out a scheme and the ABA is of the opinion that the person or persons did so for the sole or dominant purpose of avoiding the application of the genre or audio content provisions.

I would have been quite happy with 2001. If you want to leave it there, I will vote for it, but I do not know whether you will get everybody else to vote for it.</para></talk.start><para>I am having a look at the differences between Senator Brown's amendments and my own. The differences that I can see are, first of all, that he is assuming that spectrum is free. I would agree with that. In fact, I had that amendment drawn up first. I was given some advice that it was probably unconstitutional, which has now been revised to it being constitutional. That said, fabulous, I will vote for it. The datacasting licensees as a condition of licence provision is excellent. I am into that. My only problem is with sharing the multichannel capacity with the national broadcasters. </para><para>Senator Brown has not been following this debate forever, and who can blame him. There are an awful lot of debates I have not been following too. This has been a debate about what should happen, but there are some problems. I cannot vote for that. The ABC and SBS are now legislatively required to broadcast in both HD and SD; the simulcast issue has come up and simulcasting has been agreed to by all parties. The ABC and SBS will also be doing a bit of datacasting and they have been given multichannel. There is no space, there just is not any room, for them in their seven megahertz to fulfil their legislative requirements and also multiplex with community broadcasters.</para><para>I know the community broadcasters thought this was a good idea because it would help them for a long time. But I just do not think it is technically possible. I think it is technically impossible for it to happen. Plus, why should our national broadcasters be forced to give up some of their space? Why should we not force the free-to-airs to give up some of their space? I do not see why the national broadcasters should be disadvantaged by this. In fact, what I think should happen is that community broadcasters and indigenous broadcasters should be given their own space. I find it quite mystifying the way the whole thing is being handled by the government at the moment. </para><para>The minister has put out press releases that say all the right things, but nothing seems to be happening. At the committee hearings that we had into the legislation—and Senator Bishop and I were both on the committee—we asked the department about this. The department just kept telling us it would be all right. We would like to know how it will be all right. We do not think it will be all right if there is the possibility of the national broadcasters having to give up their space. They cannot do it and do all the other things that they are legislatively required to do under this legislation within the spectrum that they have. They have enough imposts on them already. We really believe that community and indigenous broadcasters should be given their own spectrum and should be allowed to use their own spectrum as they wish. I would be interested to hear what the minister actually intends to do with community broadcasters. We have seen his press release, but we have not heard a great deal about what is happening.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>15974</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my understanding that if the Australian Greens amendment (2) is defeated, Democrat amendment (R32) on sheet 1862 will come forward.

This goes to the rights of administrative appeal and determinations of the ABA to be subject to existing appeal and review arrangements. Clause 57 in schedule 6 of the bill denies interested parties the ability to access stay powers or to seek interlocutory injunctive relief in relation to decisions of the ABA. The exclusion of stay proceedings and interim interlocutory relief relating to decisions of the ABA concerning datacasting licences, we believe, needs to be removed from the act to ensure normal avenues for judicial review of ABA decisions are not precluded. This is particularly important in the context of the significant implications of these ABA decisions. Labor opposes the exclusions in the bill to restore the usual avenues for general review.</para><para>When this matter was raised—I think the representatives of Fairfax at the Senate inquiry raised the issue that their rights were about to be denied—we had some discussions and I made a mental note at the time just to make reference to it in our report. When the eventual negotiations were going to take place with the government and the Australian Democrats, I had presumed it was one of those matters that was capable of resolution by negotiation because in this area it does go to a fundamental issue of law and a fundamental issue of rights. The two issues that are interwined are, firstly, property rights and the necessary protection of those rights expressly provided for in our Constitution but, more importantly, by way of custom and practice in this country and, secondly, the right of parties, in exercising their rights in judicial appeal proceedings, not to have those rights taken away from them and a possible benefit they might derive from the exercising of their rights being denied to them prior to the completion of the appeal proceedings.  </para><para>I am very surprised that we have to go to debate on this issue. The issues at stake do involve significant sums of money. If a datacaster, for example, wishes to datacast a particular program and is restrained from doing so after review by the ABA, the aggrieved party who is denied that right simply has to stop going about his or her lawful business. They still have appeal rights to the Federal Court or higher to have the decision of the ABA overturned, but they do not have the ability to protect their legitimate financial interests. I do not understand why the rights of corporations and individuals to go about their lawful business should be denied to them in what is essentially an area that might be under dispute as to content and programming, whilst they go through tortuous legal processes. </para><para>I am not going to make a great song and dance on property rights and the rights of individuals, but I can remember that the importance of this was constantly visited upon me in my other lives as a law student and in my early years of practice—the right of individuals, the right of corporations, the right of any citizen in our community to seek relief, to seek justice through the judicial system. With due respect, I understand that the Democrats and the government are of the view that aspirant datacasters should not be able to seek interlocutory injunctive relief or access stay powers to protect their rights. When this matter comes on for vote, the opposition will oppose it, and I put those matters on the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>15978</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I should put on the record as well that if there had been a middle way to do this I would have preferred that too, but we did not have the ability. We looked for one but we were told that the time and effort involved in determining another amendment that would have looked after our concerns were so huge that being a small party without the resources to do so we could not do it. Out of the two positions that were available to the party room, the party room decided to agree with the government on this. The reason for that was that there is an expectation that whoever gets those datacasting licences may well be somebody with lots and lots of money. We would expect that because they are going to cost a lot of money. Despite everybody saying that they do not want to do it, they may well put on a broadcasting channel over the datacasting channel. If that happens and they do not take that broadcasting channel off immediately, then it is most unlikely that if they are on air for a year or 18 months, or however long it takes, they would then be able to be removed at all. Thus the original intention of the 1998 bill would have been thwarted, that there be no new broadcasters until 2007. With that in mind, we did look at amendments. We tried to find something that would have a reasonable time. Then we were asked: what is a reasonable time and how can you determine how fast the courts will work? That is a good point. How can we? We did not know. We found that we were unable to write an amendment which satisfied us. I regret that. I wish we had been able to, but we were not. We just do not have the resources. So we ended up having to determine between the two, and we determined to go with the government's original amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>15978</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to Senator Bourne's point, I do not wish to comment about the Democrats being underresourced. The more important comment she made was in the latter part of her speech when she said essentially that, after the ABA have issued a determination on a particular issue, an aggrieved party might be well funded and choose to litigate. It may take some considerable period of time before that matter is resolved in a higher court and, in the meantime, they would have the ability to datacast or broadcast their particular product and, hence, essentially gain improper advantage in the marketplace. That was really the kernel of Senator Bourne's argument. In response to that, an application for interlocutory injunctive relief or an application for stay is not automatic. There is no automatic granting of those by the court that you apply to. It is a discretionary matter in most jurisdictions, determined on merit. So once a decision of the ABA is made on a particular issue, if the aggrieved party is dissatisfied, they can apply to either stay or get injunctive relief. The court they apply to has a discretion to allow the matter or to refer it. My recollection is that that is always done on merit. So, essentially, in the merit decision, the review tribunal or review court would make a prima facie assessment of the worth or otherwise of your argument. I am not aware of whether Senator Bourne or her advisers were aware of that. So I put that on the record. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>15979</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand the concerns that people have and, clearly, we are not wanting to interfere with people's rights of appeal. It is really a matter of what should prevail in the interim. As Senator Bourne rightly says, this area is replete with gaming opportunities, and there are those who can use litigation as a business tool very effectively. The courts do not need much encouragement to have the time that an appeal comes on take what we might regard as inordinate length. If that is the case, what you do not want is a situation where there may be every incentive for someone to drag their heels and at the same time effectively be doing something which the ABA has already ruled that you cannot do and which an appeal court might ultimately agree on. It then provides opportunities for pressure to be brought to bear in other quarters; whereas what we would be keen to see is the legal process dealt with as expeditiously as possible. So something along these lines would provide every incentive to the courts themselves to ensure that the appeal is heard very speedily.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—The question is that the item stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now move to Democrat amendments Nos 45 and 46 on sheet 1827.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>15979</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These two amendments on technical standards were covered by government equipment amendments that were moved yesterday.

It is probably better that I go with the government's position on that. The ALP's position is quite different, and I will mention why I would rather not vote for the ALP's position as I understand it. In the worst possible case, it allows a datacaster to run a service for one day and then go off air for 30 days and then run it for one day and then be back off air—which is a bit similar to what happened to poor old Radio Australia with the Cox Peninsula, but not what we really wanted. So I do not think it is a particularly good idea to do it that way. I think that the amendment that both the government and the Democrats are moving similarly is a better one.

The government accepts that it may be more appropriate that these additional functions are directly reflected in the enabling legislation of each of the two national broadcasters. However, the government considers that there are problems with how the Democrat amendments propose to achieve this; in particular, the amendments would need to make it clear that the function of providing a datacasting service was under and in accordance with the conditions of a datacasting licence.</para></talk.start><para>This requirement is necessary to ensure that the ABC and SBS are subject to the same rules as other persons providing a datacasting service. There are a number of ways in which this could be achieved. It could, for example, involve making reference to the relevant regulatory regime which will apply through the Broadcasting Services Act or through replication of some or all of those provisions in the ABC and SBS acts. The government therefore undertakes to examine the most effective means of amending the ABC and SBS acts to reflect the new statutory functions, and to bring forward further legislation at the earliest opportunity. The proposed amendments would also deal with the code of practice and complaints arrangements to provide similar mechanisms to those which apply to the ABC and SBS in relation to their broadcasting services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>15981</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for that explanation and those comments.

However, I do not agree with them. My amendment would put the responsibility for dealing with datacasting laws back to the ABC and SBS boards. I know it is a fact that the ABC Act and—I am pretty sure, but I have not looked it up—the SBS Act require the boards to carry out the functions and the duties of the corporations and ensure that they are performed efficiently and with maximum benefit to the people of Australia. Those boards also have duties to maintain the independence and integrity of the corporations, and to provide accurate and impartial news and information services and ensure that they comply with legal requirements. The boards are accountable to the people of Australia through parliament—parliamentary committee inquiries and individual members of parliament—and they are also required to meet legislative requirements under a number of other acts.</para><para>If datacasting were inserted into the ABS and the SBS acts, as proposed by this amendment that we are discussing now, the ABC and SBS boards would have a duty to follow the datacasting regulations that we have already defined in the Broadcasting Services Act. The way it works at the moment is that the ABC Act—and I think it is the same with the SBS Act—requires the ABC to provide its code of practice to the ABA. Complaints about the ABC can be made to the ABA after completion of the ABC's internal complaints procedure. The ABA can recommend how the ABC should respond, but the ABC is not required to comply. The ABA may report the matter to parliament, which may act on that report. The fact is that that is what happens now, so this would not be a huge difference from what happens now; in fact, it would be almost the same as happens now.</para><para>If datacasting were inserted into those acts, that would be covered in exactly the same way, by exactly the same procedures, as currently happens with complaints. That approach does not mean that either the ABC or SBS is free of regulation or oversight but that the ABC and the SBS are answerable, as they always have been, to the parliament and not necessarily to the ABA. It gets to the ABA eventually, and so would my amendment get it to the ABA eventually, but until that point it would be covered exactly the same way as the complaints procedures are covered now within the ABC and SBS acts. So it is not a huge change to the way things are dealt with now. In fact, the huge change in the way things are dealt with now would be if we disagree with my amendment No. 41.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15982</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As always, I have listened carefully to Senator Bourne but, with all due respect, again we would rather these matters be considered in a detailed provision over time, so we will oppose the amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>15982</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As with the last amendment, I support Senator Bourne's amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>15982</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have one comment.

We do not believe there should be different obligations on the ABC and SBS compared to other datacasters. But the general review and the undertakings we have given I think will enable us to deal with them in a much more effective way, rather than simply allowing SBS and the ABC to regulate their own datacasting. There would be a risk that those boards might apply different interpretations, which would lead to uncertainty about the scope of the regime. It is all very well to say, `Yes, you can come back into the parliament and complain about it.' We all know the constraints that are involved in that. You are not likely to get up in question time and raise the matter. You might put something on notice. It becomes a sort of low-grade irritant. The industry, quite understandably, is concerned about people going off on frolics of their own. In addition, the amendment would have a major technical flaw, as consequential changes are not made to the relevant transmitter licence provisions in the Radiocommunications Act, which require the national broadcasters to hold a BSA datacasting licence before the transmitters can be used to transmit a datacasting service. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>15983</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have just one comment on that.

Just briefly by way of introduction, the opposition is of the view that we need a system whereby datacasters intending to construct walled gardens must seek a determination from the ABA giving approval for the walled garden content, with the ABA to consider whether the content would represent a broadcasting service. It is a pre facto certification approval process that is outlined in the amendments. It ameliorates the government's restrictive provision by allowing walled gardens where material would not represent a broadcasting service. It recognises that datacasters may provide Internet material via walled garden Internet services. We need a limited number of options whereby limited spectrum is used, otherwise there would be system overload, and reasonably anticipate the future of datacast services involving Internet, whilst maintaining undertakings previously given and understood for broadcasters. So the series of subclauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) go to the process whereby datacasters seek to establish walled gardens and copy content from the Internet and seek prior approval from the ABA that the material is appropriate for datacast and is not broadcast material. This, we believe, is a worthwhile amendment to the government's regime.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15984</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to just say I understand that the Democrats will support this as well.

When the arts community realised that it was going to be severely penalised by the new tax system, it went into action and appealed to all parties. Let me congratulate all parties. Finally, the government having realised that there would be majority opposition to their position, have made changes which mean that the effects of the Ralph tax solution, which is detrimental to the arts community, are going to be ameliorated.</para></talk.start><para>I reiterate that the Greens believe that even the level of $40,000 that is being used here to allow poorer artists to escape the loss of their tax deductibility ought not be there. We should not have such a restriction on the arts community, and there are, as other speakers have also said, penalties for the farming community, which concern me greatly. I reiterate that this is a triumph for the Senate and should be marked down as such. The Democrats, the opposition and, finally, the government have all come aboard here to alter what I think was an unforeseen impact, which would have been hugely detrimental to the arts community and, therefore, to the wider Australian community. In particular, I want to recognise the artists themselves and their representatives. I will not name them, but there are quite a number of them. They have worked remarkably efficiently and quickly; their information has been good; it has been convincing. When the arts community protested in Sydney, in Brisbane, outside the parliament here and elsewhere in Australia—I know the arts community in Tasmania was very concerned about this and let me know about it—it had the impact of feeding back into this chamber and allowing the Senate to put to right something that was very wrong.

The measures will limit the extent to which taxpayers can use non-commercial losses to reduce the tax paid on their other income and require that prepayments for services under tax shelter arrangements be deducted over the period during which the services are provided rather than being immediately tax deductible. These measures are part of a range of reforms that the government are legislating as part of their  new tax system, and I know that these measures enjoy your strong support, Mr Acting Deputy President.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—The tongue is in your cheek!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—I do not always agree with Senator Murphy, but from time to time we will discover some common ground, particularly in relation to integrity measures.

Again, we have been diverted by senators. Senators have also raised entity taxation and claimed that the government was not progressing the issue. That was a very unfair assertion. The government first canvassed change to the taxation of entities in a new tax system as far back as August 1998. The issue of how entities should be taxed was also one of those considered by the review of business taxation, which consulted extensively with business over a 12-month period. The review made its recommendations to government late in 1999. The government has accepted the review's recommendations on the taxation of entities and announced last year that it would apply the new rules from 1 July 2001. Since then, the government had been consulting on the implementation details of the new arrangements consistent with the consultation on other business tax measures and with the consultative processes of the Ralph review. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I would like to have my vote in favour of the opposition amendment recorded.</para></talk.start><para>Original question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>15989</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>15989</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2 together:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (line 35) to page 6 (line 4), omit subsection (4), substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Exceptions</inline></para><quote><para>	(4)	The rule in subsection (2) does not apply to a *business activity for an income year if:</para><para>	(a)	the activity is a *primary production business, or a *professional arts business; and</para><para>	(b)	your assessable income for that year (except any *net capital gain) from other sources that do not relate to that activity is less than $40,000.</para><para>	(5)	A <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">professional arts business</inline> is a *business you carry on as:</para><para>	(a)	the author of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or</para></quote><para>Note:	The expression "author" is a technical term from copyright law.

It is an indication and an expression of support for artists and primary producers, who both suffer real hardship to make a living from their professions. Most importantly, it sends a very clear message to artists that they do make a significant contribution to the cultural life of Australia and that that often cannot be calculated solely in dollar terms. The amendments being put forward by the Democrats send a strong message to all artists that, as representatives of the Australian community, we want to acknowledge the contribution that they make to our lives and we want to support and foster their efforts into the future. It has always been clear that professional artists have been lobbied to be treated in the same manner as farmers because they expect to earn their income. It is a powerful message that indicates that artists do not want to rely on welfare payments alone.</para><para>Through the amendments that are being put by the Australian Democrats, artists will be able to maintain the understanding that they negotiated with the Australian Taxation Office in 1997. They will also be able to legitimately claim their non-commercial losses as artists against their non-art income. As the government stated only last week, we as politicians need to demonstrate our support for the arts and to foster this growth industry. These amendments are an important step in fulfilling that commitment. The effects on taxation revenue need to be mentioned. It will be only marginal when we consider that many professional artists earn only a few thousand dollars per year, but the benefits to all Australians will be a stronger, flourishing, professional arts community. I believe this is a win for artists, a win for Australian culture and a win for the economy. I thank the government for their acceptance of these amendments. I note also the efforts and support of the Greens and the ALP, particularly through Senator Bob Brown and Senator Peter Cook. Finally, in closing, one thing that needs to be said in all of the political jockeying that has gone on is that, if anyone is to get credit, we need to acknowledge the effective lobbying campaign of individual artists and arts groups across the country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>15990</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just point out to the committee that Democrat amendment No. 1 is the same as Greens amendment No. 2.

They haveobviously lobbied effectively because the view now being taken in the chamber by all parties is that they should get the credit for it. That is absolutely true: Australian artists should get the credit for achieving this outcome. I made remarks about this in my speech in the second reading debate, but I want to say that the Australian artistic community are an important element of our national character. They, more than most, define Australian personality, Australian culture and Australian aspirations and give voice and expression in many artistic forms to what it is to be Australian. By their collective efforts over time, they have attained worldwide respect for the quality of the work they do and the place Australia occupies in the artistic world.</para></talk.start><para>This is a group of people who more often work, as the surveys tell us, for an annual income ranging from $6,000 to $15,000—certainly, below $20,000. They do so driven by a need to not only express artistic inspiration but also fulfil the objectives of which I have spoken. They very often put those desires and needs ahead of their own personal livelihoods. So we are not talking here about a group of people who meet the classic definition of tax avoiders. This is a group of people whose character and attitude is vastly different from the sleazy, top end of town operators who have discretionary income, enabling them to find ways through the loopholes in the tax act. Therefore, the national legislature should give recognition to what is happening here and meet the needs of nurturing a stronger artistic community rather than impose cost burdens on them through a tax net that is cast to stop malpractice. In this case, that tax net would catch a community that are critical to our national personality and a community that are not tax avoiders. For those reasons, we support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>15990</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats have moved amendments to provide an exemption from the operation of the non-commercial loss measures included in the <inline ref="R1061">New Business Tax System (Integrity Measures) Bill 2000</inline>.

This chamber asked the government to put down in this chamber what the proof of that prime ministerial assertion is and to table the model that has not thus far been revealed to the public, so that we can scrutinise the truth of the Prime Minister's assertion that it shows that petrol prices need not rise. </para></talk.start><para>This is not a light issue. This is a fundamental issue that everyone who drives a motor vehicle in Australia that consumes petrol will have to confront from midnight on Friday. This goes to the basic heart of the question of the integrity of the government. The oil companies say that, according to their calculations, the pass-through effect of the GST on their operations means that they have the ability to pass on savings of only 0.1c to Australian motorists. The Prime Minister bases his assertion that prices will not rise on the belief that there is a capacity of the oil companies to pass on 1.5c per litre in savings. </para><para>The point here is at several levels. At level one, who is telling the truth? We do not know that until we see the actual model that thePrime Minister relies on to make his assertion. The point at level two is: did the Prime Minister actually mislead the Australian community by saying—in his now infamous quote—`petrol prices need not rise' in his election manifesto while making speeches that `they will not rise' and avoid the distinction that he was telling an untruth to the Australian public to mislead them and to encourage them to vote for a GST? This is a fundamental question of prime ministerial integrity and the honesty of the government in its dealing with Australian electors. It is a fundamental question, because many people may have voted for the GST, believing the Prime Minister. They will now be disappointed that they will pay increases—and quite significant ones if they are large consumers of petroleum products—when they believed prior to that there would not be any such increase.</para><para>I think the question of prime ministerial integrity is beyond doubt: there is none. There is none because this was the Prime Minister that promised there would never ever be a GST—and in two days time there will be. But the question of integrity goes further: did he tell the truth about his GST? The only way in which he can establish that is to now table the information upon which he has based the assertion. The government has just put down a statement saying that the Prime Minister will not table the model. </para><para>This raises a question that was referred to in the editorial of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> yesterday. Yesterday, the editorial writers in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> dismissed prime ministerial integrity in one paragraph. I do not have the quote in front of me, but essentially what they said was the fact that the Prime Minister will not make his calculations available to the Australian community explains why people distrust and disbelieve him about his comments on petrol pricing. For the modulated tones of an upmarket financial newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, that is a condemnation in stinging terms of the Prime Minister's integrity. We saw yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>—the newspaper with the biggest circulation of any in Australia—the headline `GST failure' accompanied by the sub-headline `PM can't deliver on petrol price guarantee' with an article written by their senior Canberra journalist, Malcolm Farr, reporting that the Prime Minister has been caught out in what is, in fact, a misleading of the Australian community. </para><para>A select committee of this Senate conducted an inquiry into the GST and reported early last year. In conducting its inquiry, it invited submissions from interested parties around Australia. Submissions were given by the Australian Automobile Association and by the RAA in South Australia. Both of them in their submissions pointed to the fact that the cost of petrol prices would rise as a consequence of the GST, and both of them backed up that point—not as an assertion—with economic modelling. The economic modelling they relied on was from the economic consultancy Econtech, which is the consultancy run by Mr Murphy, the Prime Minister's favourite economic modeller. In the debate that we had about the GST, the government relied on private sector modelling by Mr Murphy and his company Econtech. The Australian Automobile Association and the RAA also engaged Econtech to conduct modelling for them about the impact of the GST on petrol pricing and how that would impact on consumers. As a consequence of the modelling by the Prime Minister's preferred modeller in the private sector, they found that the impact would be much higher than what the government was saying and that there would be a lack of capacity for the oil industry to absorb the costs. They put the figure, as I recall, at between 8c and 9c per litre more.</para><para>They also reported that the cost of petrol would rise more quickly in the country than in the city because of the cost of haulage of petrol supplies to locations remoter than the urban sprawl in Australia, a matter that we in the opposition have pursued with the government for some time now and which the government has partially responded to by providing a supplement to the excise, which will go some way but not all of the way to answering the problem. Country people will be even worse off because, while assistance has been rendered, the problem has not been solved. There is still price disparity.</para><para>They were the two submissions that we had before us in this chamber. What did the government do in dealing with those submissions? It rejected them on the basis of its PRISMOD model. The PRISMOD economic model is a model kept by the Australian Treasury. They ran all the calculations about the GST through the PRISMOD model. It is PRISMOD that the Prime Minister refers to when he says that the government has its own private modelling and that therefore his assertions are true. All we were asking in this motion was that the government put the detailed calculations on the table so that we could see what the PRISMOD model says. The government is saying no, it will not.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—They are covering it up.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Senator Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—That is exactly right, Senator Sherry. This is in fact a cover-up. We know that, for all the awkward and sticky questions about the GST on how the calculations are arrived at, the ultimate defence of the government is to say: `Our modelling shows ...'. But will they show us their modelling? No, they will not. In this motion we called for it to be presented and what did they do? They declined to do so. The issue that is therefore raised is, once again: is this government telling the truth? We have caught them out here. We know that they are not. Their refusal to present the information compounds the felony. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Through parliamentary scrutiny over a number of months we have been able to catch them out here. Where else are they misleading the Australian community? In what other areas of the sprawling unfair tax that is the GST have the community been misled that have not yet come to public notice? I am afraid there will be a penalty before we find that out. The penalty will begin to be paid at midnight on Friday when Australians transfer from the existing tax system to the GST system and, as they pay the new GST, they will become savagely aware of how badly misled they have been about the impact of the GST. </para><para>They will become sadly cynical about the government as well. This is the government that has spent $430 million of taxpayers' money to explain the tax to the community. What have they done? They have explained the tax cuts and failed to remind the community about the tax impost. They have conducted a public relations campaign to purify their tax. They have conducted a political campaign to justify what they have done. They have raided the public purse to fund their campaign for political purposes.  </para><para>They know the community is rejecting this tax. They know that the experience of ordinary Australians is that prices have already begun to rise ahead of the tax and that Australian consumers are paying higher prices by increases in anticipation of the new impost. They know that Australian consumers believe that the GST will rise in percentage terms over time because that has been the record wherever in the world a GST has been introduced. Whatever the percentage is now, inevitably it will go up, because everywhere else the percentage has gone up. They know that. They know too that the government have botched the introduction of this tax. </para><para>Just this week we have racked up the 2,000th amendment to the GST legislation that was introduced into this chamber last June. Ahead of the introduction of this tax, before we get started, there have been 2,000 amendments by the government to their original bill. They know that the Australian Taxation Office—the office that is charged with the duty of interpreting the meaning of the law and advising taxpayers of their taxable obligations—is well behind in providing information to taxpaying applicants about the meaning of the law and what their tax liabilities will be. If the tax office cannot tell them, who knows what obligations they have? How can taxpayers who cannot be informed of their obligations because of the backlog of complaints and private rulings in the tax office be expected to observe the law? We know that this is part of the botched introduction of this tax. We know that there are still hundreds of thousands of companies who have not yet been issued an Australian Business Number. The delay in being issued with a business number, which is essential to their operations under the new system, is preventing those companies getting themselves into order to meet the tax.</para><para>But all of this comes down to the simple proposition: the government have relied throughout the Senate inquiry, throughout the growing public concern about this tax and throughout their now bitter argument with the Australian oil industry on their computer model in the Department of the Treasury, the PRISMOD model. We are simply saying, `Table the findings of the model,' and the government are saying, `No, we will not.' I want to spend a moment on what the oil companies have said. They have said that the savings that the model is alleged to have predicted are not there. The ACCC, the price police, the body required by the government to oversee proper behaviour in terms of this tax, has begun to look at whether the oil companies are right. There are a lot of things that can be said about oil companies in Australia. I am certainly not one who has defended many of their practices, and I will not now. But they do have a fair idea of what it costs them to produce a litre of petrol. They are prepared to open their books for the ACCC to prove their assertions. They are not afraid of tabling their calculations and having them subjected to independent audit and scrutiny.</para><para>It is the government that refuses to table its calculations to show that what it asserts to be the truth is, in fact, the truth. It is a shameful display of a lack of accountability to this parliament and, through this parliament, to the people of Australia by this government in its refusal now, today—just ahead of the Prime Minister's address to the nation tonight on how good this tax is supposed to be—to produce the evidence to justify whatever high-flown assertions he will make in his national exposure on public television tonight to yet again tell Australians how good this tax is. `Put up or shut up' is what this parliament has said to the government, and the government has shut up.

In the context of the key role that the USO plays in the provision of telecommunication services throughout Australia, the opposition has identified a range of issues that arise from provisions in the bill.</para><para>At the outset, it is important to note that Labor is concerned that the government is not engaging in the process of possible reform of the USO with clean hands. Service levels have declined with the partial privatisation of Telstra, particularly in rural and regional areas. We believe that the government has ignored these areas, in its ideological obsession with the privatisation of Telstra. There are serious inadequacies in service levels in some parts of Australia. Changes to the existing USO arrangements must not be at the expense of genuine improvements in service levels in regions already suffering from inadequate service. Since the partial privatisation of Telstra, the government has sought to portray its competitive tendering framework as the solution to declining rural and regional service delivery. Competitive tendering has also been put forward as an argument favouring the pursuit of full privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>There are limitations to the government's approach to the USO tendering arrangements. Firstly, the government's plan is limited to two pilot projects in undefined areas. The results of the projects will not be known for a number of years. The success or otherwise of these pilots will not be known prior to the full privatisation of Telstra, should the government achieve its goal within its proposed time frame. Secondly, Telstra is required to remain as a safety net provider of last resort in the areas to be covered by the pilot projects. This decision by the government acknowledges the necessary and unique role of Telstra in the delivery of services to rural and regional Australia and, therefore, the folly of pursuing full privatisation.</para><para>The opposition continues to condemn the government's continued push for the full privatisation of Telstra. Full privatisation will inevitably result in a decline in services to rural and regional Australia. There is insufficient detail of how specific service difficulties faced in USO serviced areas will be addressed by these changes. The high cost and limited availability of broadband or data services represents a significant barrier to use of the Internet and other emerging digital services by rural, regional and remote communities. As a result, Labor senators believe that the universal service obligation must be upgraded in the future to encompass access to minimum digital data services. This government is ignoring the growing need for reliable data services for Australians in remote or isolated communities.</para><para>Turning now to calculating the cost of the USO, the bill allows the minister to determine the universal service cost for up to three years in advance, generally based on estimates provided by the Australian Communications Authority. The contentious issue of calculating the cost of providing the USO has been debated for some time, as the cost is borne by industry by way of an ex post facto levy based on a calculation of cost by proportion of market share. The ACA reviewed the framework for determining the USO cost in 1999 in the wake of the $1.8 billion claim for the cost by the universal service provider, Telstra. These amendments complement legislation enacted by the parliament in 1999 in advance of an ACA review. That legislation incorporated a temporary provision allowing the minister for communications to make a determination concerning the cost of providing the universal service for the years 1998-99, 2000-01 and 2001-02 for the purpose of providing industry certainty. </para><para>Concerns have been raised that the bill reduces the ACA's role in developing and administering a methodology for the calculation and collection of the USO cost and levy. Also of concern is that the bill confers a power on the minister to require the ACA to use a particular methodology or formula for determining the cost. The opposition believes that any ministerial determination regarding the cost of providing the USO, whether in full or in part, should be based on advice from the Australian Communications Authority. Furthermore, such ministerial determinations should be made by way of disallowable instrument.</para><para>Turning now to the local call zone tender, the government has proposed to issue a $150 million tender for the supply of infrastructure for untimed local call services to remote areas currently without this service. Telstra raised concerns in its submission that provisions in the bill would see the successful bidder or bidders for the $150 million tender automatically become the nominated universal service provider for the area covered by the tender. Consequently Telstra would potentially be relieved of any ongoing responsibilities in those areas.</para><para>Valid concerns have been raised that consumers in such areas may suffer adverse consequences if, for any reason, the tender project should fail. The project goes further than the two competitive tendering trials proposed in respect of the USO in that Telstra could be replaced as the universal service provider in those areas. Labor does not believe that a successful tenderer for the $150 million extension of local call zone projects should automatically become the nominated universal service provider for that area. This is particularly so when these provisions go further than the government's competitive tendering proposals.</para><para>Provisions in the bill which confer a power on the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to determine a successful bidder for the $150 million local call zone project have also been the subject of concern. Proposed new sections 20(2A) and 26A(2A) of the bill provide that, in making universal service provider declarations:</para><quote><para>The minister is not limited to considering only the person's suitability to provide the services that must be provided to fulfil the universal service obligation.</para></quote><para>The bill does not define what other matters the minister must consider. The scope of the minister's power to make declarations under these sections is of particular concern as it seems overly broad and provides little guidance as to what matters would be considered important in determining who provides a universal service for a given area. Labor believes that any prospective universal service tenderers should be selected on the basis of clear, defined and objective criteria. These criteria should be detailed in the legislation.</para><para>Turning now to carrier information proposals, the bill allows universal service providers to `require the former provider to give to the [incoming] provider specified information ... that will assist the [incoming] provider in doing something that the [incoming] provider is or will be required to do by ... this part'. The proposals appear to Labor to allow unnecessarily broad access to an incumbent carrier's information. In particular, Telstra submitted to the Senate committee in its inquiry into the bill that the provisions were `objectionably wide' because they are not limited to information that is required to carry out an obligated service, they do not limit what the incoming carrier can do with the information, they allow the minister to declare what information must be provided but do not allow the minister to declare that certain information need not be provided, they do not allow the Australian Communications Authority to declare a request unreasonable, and they do not allow the former provider to recover costs for the preparation and delivery of information. Other concerns raised include that the broad nature of the information provisions increase the potential for ambit requests designed simply to seek commercial information and that any determination by the minister should be by way of a disallowable instrument. </para><para>The information framework should, in Labor's opinion, reflect the commercial sensitivities of the information that may be sought. It is also important that the framework should address only the specific needs of an incoming carrier which are relevant to carrying out specific, obliged services or functions. Labor believes that the Australian Communications Authority should be given the power to declare a request for information unreasonable on appeal from an affected carrier. Labor believes that, consistent with freedom of information principles, carriers should be able to recover the reasonable costs of complying with a request for information.</para><para>In summary, Labor has identified several key concerns with the provisions of the <inline ref="R1073">Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline>. Labor is concerned to ensure that levels of universal telecommunications service are not compromised by changes to existing USO arrangements, that ongoing upgrades to the service levels required by the USO ensure access to minimum digital data services, that determinations by the minister of the cost of providing the USO should be based on advice from the ACA and made by way of disallowable instrument, that successful bidders in the government's $150 million tender for the supply of infrastructure for untimed local call services to remote areas will not automatically become the nominated USP for that area, that any prospective universal service tenderers are selected on the basis of clear, detailed, objective and legislatively defined criteria, that the breadth of the carrier information proposals is limited to information specifically relevant to an incoming carrier's obliged services or functions to reflect commercial sensitivities, that the ACA has power to declare a request for information unreasonable on appeal from an affected carrier, and that carriers should be able to recover the reasonable costs of complying with a request for information, consistent with freedom of information principles. Labor has had amendments drafted to give effect to those matters, and they will be circulated in due course.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>15997</page.no><id.no>R1051</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP FOR WASTE OIL) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1039</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP FOR WASTE OIL) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1042</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP (OIL) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1052</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>15997</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 28 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>15997</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I simply indicate to the chamber that the opposition supports the passage of the <inline ref="R1051">Product Stewardship (Oil) Bill 2000</inline> and associated bills without amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>15997</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to have my remarks on these bills incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted. </para><para>The speech read as follows—</para><quote><para>The genesis of these bills was Democrat concern about some of the side effects of the excise on diesel that came out during a Senate Inquiry into the environmental effects of tax reform.

The idea to address the problem of waste oil in the environment, encouraging its greater collection, recycling and reuse.</para><para>The proper disposal of waste oil has been a problem in Australia, although we are better than many other countries. Oil can be very polluting if it gets into our water courses, and there are millions of litres of used oil that are unaccounted for in Australia.</para><para>The purpose of the legislation is to establish a product stewardship system for waste oil, thereby it introduces an excise style levy (5c/litre, raising about $25m) on lubricating oils (domestically produced and imported), which will then be collected from producers by the ATO, and disbursed monthly to recyclers. </para><para>Recyclers will receive subsidies according to the volume of recycled oil they sell, the quality and the intended use of that oil (processing to a higher grade oil will attract a higher subsidy). This will be important in ensuring that waste oil is processed to its highest and best use.</para><para>The 5c levy should not cause undue problems for anyone. We would expect there to be some sharing of the cost between the producers and consumers, and this is entirely appropriate if behaviour is to be changed. Not only will less oil be dumped or inappropriately used, there should be more and better recycling.</para><para>The Advisory Council will provide an avenue whereby the industry can provide advice to the Minister.

The purpose of the bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech that has been incorporated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Troeth. The first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The Bill seeks to amend the <inline font-style="italic">Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Vegetable) Regulations</inline> to clarify the rate of levy intended to be struck on vegetables that were grown <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">and</inline> processed by the producer, between 1 March 1996 and 30 June 1999. </para></quote><para>Those dates are important because the bill has a retrospective effect. But the purpose is to correct an inequity that occurred during that period with some fresh vegetables that were processed by the grower. Normally the levy is imposed on fresh vegetables at the first point of sale. But, for instance, in the circumstance where cucumbers have been processed into pickles by the grower, the cucumbers attracted a significantly higher value added price which has, in turn, led to a higher than usual levy assessment. This bill gives effect to an agreement between the industry and the government to correct that inequity. Therefore, we are not opposed to the passage of the bill. However, I do understand that there is another issue which my colleague Senator O'Brien will inform the Senate of with respect to his home state of Tasmania. On that basis, I leave my remarks at this point, indicating that we are not opposed to the passage of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>15999</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1098">Primary Industries Legislation Amendment (Vegetable Levy) Bill 2000</inline> is a necessary piece of legislation to correct an anomaly for vegetable growers, a particular anomaly that was drawn to the attention of the government and the opposition in relation to just that situation which Senator Forshaw referred to—a grower who processed his own pickles from his own crop. But we find that, with the correction of one problem for rural industries, another one emerges. I have received a copy of correspondence sent by the seed potato organisation in Victoria, Seed Potatoes Victoria. Being from Tasmania, it is not surprising that I am speaking about potatoes, but it just so happens that Victoria is the major producer of seed potatoes for this country. According to this organisation, Victoria produces somewhere in the vicinity of 85 per cent of certified seed potatoes for Australia and somewhere in the vicinity of 35,000 tonnes of certified seed potatoes annually. A situation has been drawn to our attention which relates to the changed view of the tax office in relation to the GST implications for seed potatoes. I wanted to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> some comments from Seed Potatoes Victoria made in correspondence which is dated 22 June this year. It says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Following from our telephone conversation this morning I feel that I must write to you to explain more fully the implications of the decision by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to reverse the Goods and Services Tax (GST) status of seed potatoes to be no longer GST Free. This is a decision which will undermine the work of the last 60 years to develop a certification system for potatoes, a system that has benefited both the industry and consumers.</para></quote><para>It then goes on to talk about the importance of the seed potato industry in Victoria, both to Victoria and nationally, and that there was an early indication from the tax office that seed potatoes would not attract a GST. The fact of the matter is that that has now been changed and individual growers have been told that they must collect a GST on the sale of seed potatoes. Further on in the letter, Mr Tony Pitt, the author of the letter, says:</para><quote><para>Price and quality are the key drivers of the marketplace for potatoes. The volume of certified seed sold each year will be dependent on the relative price of certified seed potatoes compared to potatoes which can be used for planting but are not certified. The impost of a 10% Goods and Services Tax on potatoes sold with certification labels will clearly drive buyers towards other products. Some of this will be to unlabelled seed and some will be to potatoes not produced within certification protocols. The 10% will be redeemable by the buyer as a tax credit, but this is a very competitive industry and there will clearly be a marketplace rejection of the product with 10% added at the time of sale in comparison to that which has no GST. Potato buyers act on the price that they pay today, not on what they might get back in three months time. It is an industry run on credit lines and credit limits. The extra 10% will commonly result in purchase of a cheaper product. There is no way to differentiate potatoes sold to a buyer for either fresh consumption or for planting other than through a certification label and so that the non labelled product will have a clear advantage in the marketplace. The legislation may stipulate that GST equally applies to both certified seed and unlabelled seed but it will be impossible to enforce the latter with the way our industry operates. </para></quote><para>What is clearly suggested is that some producers produce potatoes which can ostensibly be sold for consumption but which in reality can be purchased for use as seed. Obviously, a potato planted in the ground will generally germinate, whether or not it is certified for seed or sold ostensibly for consumption. This is an issue which this organisation raises. Mr Pitt puts what he describes as a worst case scenario for the industry. Anyone would readily concede, as he does, that it is one of the more pessimistic views of what might happen. Nevertheless, he felt that it ought to be recorded that the possible outcome of this changed GST implication for this industry could be as follows. He says the likely repercussions of the decision in a worst case scenario are:</para><quote><para>Trade in certified seed <inline font-style="italic">declines</inline> by 15% as result of cash flow preference to purchase other potatoes for planting;</para><para>Trade in non labelled seed increases by 15% as a means to now jointly avoid part of the certification levy and the GST;</para><para>Certification fees drop by 30% overall which takes the certification authority below the critical volume of fees required to support the certification system;</para><para>The certification system collapses due to financial constraints. Private certification schemes will probably develop to replace the current scheme;</para><para>Export trade in certified seed collapses because importing countries will not recognise the integrity of privately run schemes;</para><para>The work done in developing a certification scheme in potatoes for the past 60 years is lost as personnel and expertise leave to find other areas of employment;</para><para>Ultimately consumers suffer in the long term as disease levels rise again in potato districts and quality and farm productivity decline</para></quote><para>Mr Pitt goes on to say that, whilst he advises this as the most pessimistic scenario, there will definitely be an impact on the marketplace and that the biggest potential loser is Australia as a whole, because inefficiency in production from introduced and unnecessary bias in seed purchase and potential loss of export markets are a real threat. He finishes by saying, with regard to the tax office treatment of the GST application to seed potatoes:</para><quote><para>If this was not a grey area we surely would not have been advised previously by the ATO that seed potatoes were not subject to the GST.</para></quote><para>That is a very interesting point. The confusion that exists for important parts of Australian rural industries remains. One has to say that the differentiation of advice between the head body and individual farmers has created a lot of confusion and concern. My state of Tasmania is a major grower of the potato crop. Annual production is in the order of 400,000 tonnes, which is about one-third of our national production. In Tasmania, most of that production goes into the processing sector; but the production of seed potatoes—while not on the scale of the industry in Victoria, obviously—is still an important industry in Tasmania, and the seed potato producers industry is now being confronted with the GST.</para><para>This is yet another of the problems that this so-called simple tax is causing. The implications are emerging day by day that, clearly, were not contemplated when this tax was introduced. There are very many implications for rural industries with the introduction of the GST—which will become apparent in the ensuing months. At the end of the day, the government's pronouncement that the GST will be good for rural industries will be proven to be baseless. Having said that, the opposition will be supporting this legislation. We do not wish to have any unforeseen consequences of the application of levies to vegetable production causing damage to rural industries and we will therefore be supporting this legislation without amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>16000</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I thank honourable senators for their comments—although one would have to suspect that Senator O'Brien's comments could be interpreted as a very wide interpretation of `vegetables', which is what this bill deals with. I would point out to him that one would expect that serious growers would be looking for certification as part of their quality assurance arrangements. The GST in that instance becomes a side issue. Growers are looking to provide a quality product, and seed certification is part of that quality assurance program. However, we are here to correct the anomaly which disadvantages those vegetable growers who choose to process their vegetables on the farm before the first point of sale happens. In the previous way that this levy arrangement operated, they have been disadvantaged. The only way to retain equity among all growers was to adjust the rate back to the commencement of the levy, which was 1 March 1996. I do stress, however, that this covers transactions between 1 March 1996 and 30 June 1999. It is to correct the anomaly that occurred then and to redress the disadvantages suffered by those growers during that time. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SALES TAX (CUSTOMS) (INDUSTRIAL SAFETY EQUIPMENT) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16001</page.no><id.no>R1063</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SALES TAX (EXCISE) (INDUSTRIAL SAFETY EQUIPMENT) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1064</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SALES TAX (GENERAL) (INDUSTRIAL SAFETY EQUIPMENT) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1062</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SALES TAX (INDUSTRIAL SAFETY EQUIPMENT) (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1065</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16001</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>16001</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is probably the last time that the Senate will consider legislation in respect of sales tax, commonly known as wholesale sales tax, or WST. Given that this is the principal tax being replaced by the goods and services tax, which commences on Saturday 1 July, it is an appropriate time to make some observations about the many misleading and inaccurate criticisms of the wholesale sales tax, particularly when compared with the so-called advantages of the goods and services tax.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I will go to a brief history of the wholesale sales tax. As many know, it was introduced in 1930. The fact that it was introduced in the 1930s is often used as a point of criticism, but of course income tax was introduced into this country prior to 1930 and we are not abolishing it. Since the tax was introduced, it has been significantly improved to give effect to a range of government policies, including concessions and provisions to measures that prevented the double taxation of goods. These policies have led to the introduction of multiple rates of tax, which occurred in 1940, to put more of the revenue raising effort onto luxury goods. There are a wide range of exemptions for goods used by particular persons or by particular organisations, such as schools and charities, and there are exemptions or reduced rates of tax on goods used as inputs in goods producing industries. </para><para>The WST is a single-stage tax on goods manufactured in or imported into Australia for use in Australia. It applies only to goods but is not limited to the sale of goods. It is important to note that the sales tax does not apply to most services, fresh food, water and energy—in other words, most essential goods. It does not apply to housing and buildings, although some fittings are taxed, goods manufactured principally from second-hand materials which are sold as second-hand goods, and goods that are to be exported from Australia. The tax applies at the wholesale level. This means that the standard 22 per cent sales tax rate is often less of a tax burden, for instance, than a 10 per cent GST would be on the full retail price. The concessional wholesale sales tax rate of 12 per cent is almost always considerably less of a tax burden than a 10 per cent GST, because the GST applies through the chain of supply through to retail prices. </para><para>Manufacturers and wholesalers register and quote their certificate numbers to buy goods tax free. Generally, only manufacturers and wholesalers are liable to pay the tax, notretailers. Charities, hospitals, schools and other exempt bodies can buy goods tax free by presenting a conditional exemption certificate. The sales tax is self-assessed. Manufacturers with sales above certain thresholds and all wholesalers are required to calculate and pay the appropriate tax on their transactions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Manufacturers are required to pay wholesale sales tax only where their annual tax liability is more than $1,000 or their total annual turnover is more than $50,000. As I said earlier, most essential goods are exempt from the sales tax. Some of the exemptions include food and clothing—they apply unconditionally. Others are conditional upon the goods being used by particular persons such as government departments, schools or charities or for particular purposes, such as use in an agricultural industry. </para><para>Setting aside the two special wholesale sales tax rates introduced by the Howard government in 1997 for alcoholic drinks, there are five main rates of tax that can apply to goods: the zero rate, which applies to most necessities; the concessional rate of 12 per cent—introduced by the Menzies government in the 1950s as I understand it; the normal rate of 22 per cent; the higher rate of 32 per cent; and the special rate of 45 per cent, which applies only to that part of the value of a luxury car which is above the luxury car threshold, which in 1997-98 was $57,721. </para><para>The wholesale sales tax is not perfect, but no tax is. There are a number of products that are currently free from the wholesale sales tax. Such articles are baby equipment such as prams, cots, safety harnesses, baby foods, wedding dresses—along with other clothing, bicycle helmets, coffins, caskets, urns, tampons, sanitary pads and wedding rings. There is a considerably longer list, but I give those as a number of examples.</para><para>There are a number of advantages to a wholesale sales tax. Firstly, and importantly, it allows some goods to be taxed at a lower rate than others. This means that Australians pay less tax on the necessities of life, many community organisations and charities can be exempted and luxuries can be taxed more heavily. Other advantages of the wholesale sales tax include the fact that it is not levied on a range of essential items such as food, clothing and electricity. It is a very cheap tax to collect and administer. It costs only about 0.5 per cent of the revenue collected. It also works. It will raise more than $15.447 billion this financial year at a very low administrative cost. It is flexible: it can cope with exemptions and differentials and can be used for special situations such as the 1997 state franchise tax crisis. Finally, it is levied on wholesale not retail prices.</para><para>The WST is very cheap to administer. The main reasons for this are the small number of tax collectors—that is, businesses or enterprises regularly lodging returns—and the simplicity of documentation required with respect to WST returns; for example the data on total sales minus sales to exempt buyers. There are only about 75,000 active tax collectors of the wholesale sales tax lodging returns. We do know that under the GST, which replaces a wholesale sales tax, there will probably be two million-plus more taxpayers collecting the GST. Under a GST, every business, every farm and every enterprise is collecting and remitting the GST to the Taxation Office. Business returns are significantly more complex, with data required on inputs purchased and GST paid on those inputs, as well as sales information and further details to deal with complications such as sales of second-hand goods, spending on vehicles, phone bills, et cetera, where there is some personal use. Because the WST is cheap for the Taxation Office to administer, the Taxation Office can use its scarce resources to target tax evasion throughout the system rather than being bogged down in processing GST returns. There will be about an extra 3,000 tax collectors as a result of the GST.</para><para>There have been a number of false claims made about wholesale sales tax. It is interesting to note that the government, in the manifesto propaganda document that it took to the last election, made strong criticisms of the wholesale sales tax system. It said on page 8 of that document:</para><quote><para>The current tax system is ineffective. It provides a crumbling base from which to derive the necessary revenue to fund essential government services, including those provided to rural and regional areas, as well as those provided through the social security system. It is totally inconsistent to be committed to maintaining or increasing current levels of expenditure on social security but to be opposed to fair and systematic reform of a crumbling tax base. </para></quote><para>That was some of the criticism by the Liberal-National Party in respect of the wholesale sales tax. It is somewhat ironic that they are criticising the so-called crumbling tax base and the moneys that are needed to be spent in respect of social security when this government has consistently cut moneys in the areas of social security, education, health and, in particular, rural and regional areas. </para><para>It is also interesting to note that the government propaganda document criticising the wholesale sales tax does not contain any revenue forecasts about what would occur with the retention of the wholesale sales tax. It is no wonder the government did not include revenue forecasts in that propaganda document. If we go to the revenue forecasts in this year's budget strategy and outlook papers, we see that paper No. 1 shows that the claim that the WST is part of a crumbling tax base is simply untrue. </para><para>One of the arguments put is that WST is in decline because it is based on a manufacturing economy which is in decline, and not the services economy, which is growing. This is also not true. Revenue from wholesale sales tax has been steadily increasing from 1989-90, when it raised $10.13 billion, to the last year of collection, when it raised $15.4476 billion. Why is this? In a report known as the Monash model provided to the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System, Messrs Dixon and Rimmer commented:</para><quote><para>The bulk of indirect taxes are collected on consumption and intermediate usage of goods and services. In our base case forecast, collection of consumption taxes is projected to grow at about the same rate as gross domestic product. </para></quote><para>And why is this? Sales tax applies to many fast-growing consumption items—for example, electronic equipment, scientific equipment, cars and entertainment. So the wholesale sales tax is indirectly taxing a large part of the growing services sector.</para><para>In the debate on the goods and services tax replacing the wholesale sales tax, the issue of replacing state payroll taxes appears to have got lost. As we know, state payroll taxes are to continue. While the GST is replacing the wholesale sales tax, which has continued to collect adequate revenue for government, it is not replacing a whole array of other indirect taxes. An example is the excise duty on unleaded petrol. That has certainly been in the media recently. Under a GST regime the excise duty on unleaded petrol continues. It will collect just over $5 billion in the 1999-2000 financial year. That increases to $5.9 billion in 2000-01—an increase of 18.8 per cent.</para><para>Another example is that of beer. Recently, we have had some controversy about the Prime Minister's commitment that beer prices were going up by only 1.9 per cent, or thereabouts. In 1999-2000, the excise on beer was $892 million. It rises to $1.44 billion in the year 2000-01—an increase of 61 per cent. There are similar figures in respect of spirits. Tobacco excise taxes increase from $1.74 billion in the year 1999-2000 to $5.124 billion in the year 2000-01—a massive increase. </para><para>So we had the argument that the GST would be introduced to replace all of those indirect taxes and that we would end up with a simpler tax system. I see Senator McGauran in the chamber, the well-known representative of the National Party which has accepted this line of argument and a line of other arguments that are directly contrary to the interests of people who live in rural and regional Australia. I say to the Senator that I will get to that issue. Along with the GST, we have a new wine equalisation tax that will collect $549 million in the year 2000-01. The GST was to replace the so-called inefficient indirect taxes. It has replaced the wholesale sales tax but it has not replaced excise duties, and we have a new wine equalisation tax that will collect $549 million. </para><para>It is interesting to note that, after the introduction of the GST, some indirect taxes will remain. Those indirect taxes, on top of the GST, will raise more revenue: some $24.1 billion in the next financial year. That is almost double what the wholesale sales tax will collect in its last year of operation, which is approximately $15.4 billion. As an interesting aside, the budget papers show that the inequitable income tax cuts, to which the government is fond of referring, start on 1 July. Those income tax cuts will reduce revenue to the government, which this financial year was $72.3 billion, to $67.7 billion in the next financial year. It is interesting to note that the reduction in income taxation revenue to the government to $67.7 billion in the next financial year is slightly more than the amount that was collected by the government from income tax in the year 1998-99—that is, $67.3 billion. So the reduction in revenue to the government from income tax occurs for only one year and then that amount starts to grow again. To top it off, taxes on superannuation—that is, taxes on the retirement incomes of Australians—increase from $3.9 billion this financial year to $5.2 billion in the next financial year.  </para><para>So at the dawn of the new era of the GST, which commences on Saturday, we have ended up with large indirect taxes remaining—that is, excise taxes in respect to alcohol, cigarettes and petrol. Why did the government keep these indirect excise taxes rather than get rid of them when the GST is imposed? The government gains a windfall in tax revenue collection because excise taxes are indexed in line with increases in the consumer price index—the cost of living. That is pushed up by the GST. As a consequence, the government ends up collecting hundreds of millions of dollars a year more in revenue from excise taxes than it would otherwise have collected. We have seen the recent controversies surrounding beer and petrol prices. </para><para>We also have the introduction of a new wine equalisation tax, collecting about half a billion dollars in revenue each year. It is interesting to note that that half a billion dollars in revenue from the new wine tax exceeds the amount collected by all the other taxes that are being abolished—the other seven or eight taxes—excluding the wholesale sales tax. Income taxes will still raise more revenue for the government in 2000-01 than they did in 1998-99. Payroll tax continues. We have added a massive new tax on just about everything, the goods and services tax, which raises $24 billion a year. </para><para>What do we have with this GST that is supposedly to replace the inefficient, outdated wholesale sales tax? We have a new, inefficient and very costly tax to collect, particularly for the 2.5 million Australian businesses—particularly small businesses, farmers and the like—who for the first time have become tax collectors. This tax costs more to collect than the wholesale sales tax ever did. We end up with a goods and services tax that is riddled with more anomalies, inconsistencies and exemptions than the wholesale sales tax ever had. We end up with a $430 million propaganda campaign telling us that the dawn of the new era on Saturday is all a good thing for Australians. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>16004</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the dying hours of the wholesale sales tax, I presume Senator Sherry felt it necessary to defend it.

If Senator Sherry wants to defend that ramshackle old system, then I suppose I will let him. However, when the senator's party accepts the GST on 1 July, we will repeat his speech to him and ask him whether he will cross the floor and lead the party in the Senate to call for the return of the wholesale sales tax.

I would endorse her comments about the importance of getting a message through to women that they should look after their calcium intake, no matter what their age. It is very important. We can all do that by drinking milk, for example, and eating yoghurt—all of which are totally GST free—and this should become a lifelong habit.</para></talk.start><para>I am concerned if Senator Crowley is making light of the substantial tax assistance that women are going to have out of the tax reforms. Senator Crowley's question would in fact imply that women are not going to have the means to buy the products that they are currently buying. The facts are that the substantial tax reforms, the reduction in the rate of tax, the fact that people will not be paying tax on the first $6,000 of their income and that older people will not be paying tax until they have reached over $14,000 mean that people are going to have a lot more money in their pocket with which to buy the things they need. Many items have been covered by the GST health exemption, but I assume the items that Senator Crowley is referring to have not been on the GST free side of the line. But, having said that that may be so, women can afford to buy them because they have the means with the compensation arrangements under the A New Tax System to buy them out of the extra dollars they will have in their pocket after 1 July.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16005</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Education is the big winner under the A New Tax System. Education services are GST free, university HECS debts are GST free, TAFE course fees are GST free and university fees are GST free. In fact, costs across the board will fall for education. Treasury calculates that when you unchain Labor's unfair wholesale sales tax you reduce the cost of education by almost $1 billion over the next four years. That is a reduction of over $1 billion over the next four years, which is good news for the education sector in Australia. When we look at schools we see that where a school charges a fee for the supply of an education course that consists of tuition, facilities and other curriculum related activities and instruction, this is GST free. Accommodation at boarding schools and rural students hostels will be GST free. School excursions, school camps and other extracurricular activities relating to school curriculum will be GST free. Non-profit tuckshops will be input taxed and outside the GST system.</para></talk.start><para>When you unchain the unfair tax system that Labor imposed—that wholesale sales tax system—on stationery, computers, calculators and sporting equipment, you get cheaper prices for Australia's students. The tax concessions that apply to charities will also apply to government schools, ensuring consistent treatment across the government and non-government school sectors. Importantly, revenue from the GST goes directly to state governments, which will deal directly with education demands placed on them in those states. This means increased revenue and resources for education in the states.</para><para>There has now been a ruling, I am pleased to say, in relation to adult and community education. This complements the determination made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It includes adult and community education courses that are funded or recognised by state and territory governments and similar courses offered by non-profit adult education providers. It covers tertiary courses that include vocational education and training courses accredited by the states and territories. Importantly, it relates to English, Asian and European language courses that are recognised by state and territory governments and would be covered by these determinations. In fact, what this ruling by the Taxation Office has done is assist those providers in assessing what is GST free. It relates to adult and community education courses that are likely to add to the employment related skills of people undertaking the course. Of course, that is very important for those mature age students who want to gain employment.</para><para>This government has spent $17 million assisting various organisations in getting ready for the new tax system. This new tax system is good news for the education sector. It spells increased assistance by way of Austudy and youth allowance for Australia's students, and it also provides over $1 billion in cost cuts over the next four years for the education sector in this country.

On 1 July the importance of this change will become apparent to the Australian community—those who are not convinced at this moment. It will deliver very significant benefits for Australian families, for business. Also 1 July heralds the fact that the Labor Party from 1 July supports the GST. That is what the Labor Party has said.

With the introduction of the goods and services tax the government will reduce the excise on petrol and diesel so that the pump prices of these commodities for consumers need not rise.

It is also important to note—this was not mentioned by Senator Conroy—that the cost of fuel to business will fall by approximately 10 per cent due to the availability of input tax credits. Schemes to lower the cost of fuel—such as the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme—all lower the net taxation of fuel.</para><para>As I said, the tax reform is good for Australia.

Indeed employment levels in the IT&amp;T sector grew some 12 per cent last year, with some 17,500 new jobs. We have introduced a number of very important initiatives, such as those building on IT strengths—$158 million worth in fact. There is also the BARN—Building Alternative Rural Networks—initiative, a $70 million project. Both initiatives were opposed by the Labor Party. Then of course there is our historic capital gains tax reform. All of these initiatives are very good news indeed. If you contrast that with what the alternative approach is, the latest effort—which I think really takes the cake—is a press release that I saw yesterday headed `Launch of Australian parliamentary Internet group: a nonpartisan forum'. Senator Kate Lundy said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>It is my hope that, by inviting my parliamentary colleagues to participate in a nonpartisan, informative forum, Australian policy makers ...</para></quote><para>Et cetera, et cetera; mere words. This event actually took place at 12 noon yesterday. Who was invited? Let me first of all tell you who turned up. Mr Beazley was there, but my information is that not a single other parliamentarian was there. Did the media turn up? A couple of them turned up—Senator Lundy's preferred preselection newsletter, the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, was there. But did any of them run it? No, of course they didn't. It did not get a run anywhere. Senator Lundy no doubt saw this as a market opportunity because you have Mr McMullan out there as nominally the shadow minister for technology who never says boo on the subject. I suppose she thought, `Why not? I'd better try to impress the leader and tell him that I have something going for me, and I have this nice little idea.' The only trouble is that the idea was suggested by the Internet Industry Association. They wanted a genuine nonpartisan forum in parliament house to discuss these issues. They said that they would organise it for yesterday, but Senator Lundy said, `No, leave it to me. I will fix it up and invite everyone.'</para><para>So they came along thinking that was what was going to occur. What did they discover last night? They discovered that Senator Stott Despoja had not been invited. So they smelt a very big rat, and they rang my office in the morning to find out that we had not been invited either. Do you know what time the invitations were received for a 12 noon meeting? They were received at 12.49 p.m.—that is when they came in on the Internet. I presume from that that either Senator Lundy deliberately boycotted her own colleague Senator Bishop—no doubt she sees him as a bit of a competitor in this area, so no doubt he was not invited—or else of course these people were invited and they deliberately boycotted the function because they knew it was a very shabby stunt. This is a matter of very serious concern to us because Senator Lundy has form. She went along to the Internet Industry Association and was introduced as the shadow minister for youth and sport affairs and the shadow minister for assisting the shadow minister on information technology in relation to information technology. They fell about laughing when the penny dropped that Labor did not even have a spokesman in the area.</para><para>I am thinking of referring this matter to the ACCC for misleading and deceptive conduct. But probably we can rely on industry self-regulation because I think, after this very shabby job application from somebody who has not asked a question on youth affairs in the 18 months since the last election, she is clearly doing `a Cheryl'. She is saying to Mr Beazley: `I am sick of this; I want out of here. I want to be promoted to a job that we haven't got at the moment. Please consider me.' So poor old Kim turns up—you know, the Kim and Kate show, Y2K, they were the only two there—and the end result was that this did not get a run anywhere. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Nevertheless, I got the gist of your question, Senator. Yes, there have been mail-out problems with the child-care benefit, and I am disappointed in that. But I would point out to you that this is one of the most significant changes in Australia's history, not just for my department but also for the tax department and Centrelink. Millions of people who have entitlements under my portfolio have had a succession of information items going to them over the last few months. In March, for example, the families were sent out a mail-out of a form they were required to fill in to be able to claim entitlements for the new family tax benefits and for child-care benefit. </para></talk.start><para>I am advised by my department and by Centrelink that the department has put in place measures which will ensure that any family currently receiving child-care assistance will continue to pay the reduced child-care fees. Services have been sent a great deal of information over the last six months, and more material is going out to them in a phased way, which should end by tomorrow. So they will be in a position to help them estimate fee reductions which will apply from 1 July. Families using approved child-care services will not miss out on the higher assistance through the new child-care benefit. All families will be getting the full entitlements within two weeks, and most will be getting them next week. The higher fee reductions will be backdated to 1 July. There have been problems; I acknowledge that. It is estimated that the problems have affected assessments for about 10 per cent of the families using approved child care, which is approximately 40,000 families. The explanation I have been given is that some listings of assessment information sent to the child-care services were incomplete. That is being corrected urgently, and it is expected that automatic re-assessments will be completed by Centrelink tomorrow, and the information will be with child-care services next week. </para><para>Centrelink are also aware that call demand as a result of the new tax system and the problems arising from the data errors with the child-care benefit have created significant additional load for the call centres, and Centrelink are taking urgent steps to increase their call centre capacity. I might point out that they have already had hundreds of extra people trained up for the implementation of these new family tax benefit and child-care benefits. They are now increasing the call centre capacity by extending the hours of operation, by interactive voice response options, by offering callbacks if a customer prefers not to wait and utilising non-call centre staff to handle overflows. </para><para>I am very sorry that this has caused confusion and some extra administration for child-care services, but it will be fixed quickly and the new system will be much better for services once they are fully implemented. I must say that I have been very heartened in this last week by child-care service organisations who say that they have been extremely well served by the implementation information that has gone to them. There has been a continuous stream of information and the provision of seminars. Despite the noise that is coming across the table, I hope you can hear this, Senator, because clearly you are interested in the answer, even if your leader is not.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16010</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

That is, of course, painful for the community that has used the area for waterskiing for over 50 years—and, for family activities and the like, there are few such opportunities in that area of regional Australia. Nevertheless, it is necessary for the community to accept that pain because of the cultural and spiritual significance of the lagoon to the Aboriginal people. They, in turn, will be disappointed. I accept that they are going to have to wait for just under a further two years before the ban on waterskiing will come into effect. The reason for that, as the honourable senator will know, as he has apparently read my press release, is that the independent reporter advised that the previous order had allowed an unrealistic time for the development of an alternative waterskiing site and that the period should be extended until May 2002. </para></talk.start><para>The community has in the last 18 months or so progressed the matter, and a report on a feasibility study for the development of an alternative site at Goondiwindi was in fact delivered this month, so it has got to that stage. The community now has a period until 2002 to progress the matter to development of the alternative site. I think doing that will help develop broad based community support for the change that is going to have to occur in relation to the use of the lagoon. Building that broad based community support is going to be very important.</para><para>I have noted that the Aboriginal Land Council now has a draft management plan, which the Commonwealth has also assisted through funding. It will be important over the next 18 months to communicate that effectively to the broader community and to endeavour to bring that community on side for the very dramatic change that is going to occur in the usage of the region. I have also suggested that, during this intervening period, the New South Wales government might exercise its responsibilities as a manager and put in place appropriate restrictions on the usage of the lagoon, as might apply in terms of the times of day that it could be used, the number of boats that might be used and the area of the lagoon that might be used. There is no doubt that this is a difficult issue, but I think the advice I have accepted and the determination I have made will best enable a transition to a situation where a new management regime is put in place that has the potential for broad based community support.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16011</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I have a supplementary question.

She has had a longstanding interest in law enforcement and issues related to illegal drugs. I can confirm that Australian law enforcement has been advised that heroin has been found in amphetamine type stimulants sourced from South-East Asia's Golden Triangle. The instances that have been recently reported are of heroin refineries clearly diversifying into production of these ATSs, amphetamine type stimulants.</para></talk.start><para>I understand the new tablets are meant to be crushed and smoked in preference to being taken orally or processed to be taken intravenously. The growth in this area is driven by the exorbitant profits because of the increased demand for these types of stimulants and the lower production costs. Amphetamine type stimulants can be produced in clandestine labs year-round. Producers do not have to have any regard to crop yields or weather conditions. It is quite easy to produce. ATS manufacture is also facilitated by very easy access to the precursor chemicals in some of the neighbouring countries. Experts argue that the inclusion of heroin in the amphetamine type stimulants is designed to enhance addiction in very early years. If that is true, the drug traffickers have sunk to new levels of greed and moral turpitude.</para><para>These ATS-heroin tablets are embossed with markings that represent the originator. It shows that the gall the traffickers have is quite breathtaking. It may also be designed to facilitate the amphetamine type substance distribution to existing heroin users. Either way, the important point is that poly drug use is extremely dangerous for addicts. Poly drug use is rising in Australia. Poly drug use is clearly implicated in a significant number of overdose deaths of Australian addicts. It is important for people who see themselves as great reformers to bear in mind that safe injecting rooms will not protect Australians from these new heroin-ATS combinations, nor from the dangers of poly drug use. They will do nothing in that respect.</para><para>Fortunately, there have not yet been any confirmed reports of these tablets reaching Australia—although our friends in law enforcement in South-East Asia have had seizures at airports that service direct flights to Australia, so it may not be long before they do surface here. The Australian Federal Police and Customs have been alerted to these very disturbing developments by our good friends in law enforcement in South-East Asia. It is a timely warning to drug traffickers that we have excellent relationships with law enforcement groups in Asia and in other countries at which these drugs are targeted. There is international cooperation to deal with these people. We maintain very close intelligence links with agencies in South-East Asia that are at the moment battling an epidemic of these amphetamine type stimulants. We have the best border protection in the region in terms of prohibited drugs. Seizure rates of prohibited drugs of all types have increased markedly under the Tough on Drugs strategy. For amphetamine type stimulants, water seizures have increased from 41 kilograms in 1995-96 to 115 kilograms in 1998-99 and over 225 kilograms so far this financial year. The revelations concerning heroin and ATS are a simple message to law reformers that there is no room for complacency. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Application</title><page.no>16013</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>16013</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer.

The bad news for the senator is that this issue was raised by the government and the local member some 18 months or two years ago. It is not a revelation; it is not new. It is as a consequence of that and other things that we have increased surveillance of our coastline. We have a new helicopter for the Torres Strait region, for example, at great expense—a very substantial piece of equipment. I think it can fly at 200 and something kilometres an hour and it has a searchlight underneath that will light up a football field. This type of expensive equipment is required in the Torres Strait because of this type of trade. If you have been up there, Senator Greig, you will understand; if you have not then I recommend you go to Thursday Island and take a trip from there up to Saibai Island, which is the one closest to Papua New Guinea, and you will see the capacity for island hopping in nothing more than an aluminium dinghy. It is of concern not only to the government and to the local member but also to the local indigenous communities who, if you visit them, will tell you that they believe their culture is being destroyed by marijuana coming into their cultures.  </para></talk.start><para>The short answer is I have not seen the comments by the person to whom you refer. The government has been aware of the problem for some time, as has the local member. It is as a consequence of that that we have shifted more equipment and resources up there. For example, we have a Federal Police officer up there as a liaison officer and we have a Customs officer. They were not there in the past. In addition to that, we have more equipment up there, including the helicopter, and an increased surveillance capacity because it is a very difficult surveillance task, especially at night. I do not raise the business of the helicopter having the floodlight under it for fun. If anyone has been there and seen these small islands, the short distance between them and the easy capacity to travel around them at night relatively speaking undetected, you would understand the importance of that type of equipment. I do not have the exact figures of how much we have put up there. I can assure you that we have attended to the problem as best we can.

We have addressed all of the problems that have been referred to. The compensation that is occurring in relation to aged care is across the board, as I mentioned the other day. There is more than adequate compensation for the extra expenses for services that were previously not taxed. It is a goods and services tax.

The South Pacific sanctuary will protect blue whales, southern right whales, sperm whales and humpbacks as well as species lesser known in this region, including minke and fin. Populations of these species are a small fraction of their original numbers because of commercial whaling.</para></talk.start><para>The proposed sanctuary will ensure that these majestic whales are protected in their feeding grounds around Antarctica as well as in their breeding grounds in the South Pacific. Whilst getting three-quarters of the vote—which is what is necessary under the IWC rules—at the first try will be extremely difficult, the government is nevertheless pleased with the support that it is receiving. It is pleased with support it has received from the South Pacific. The South Pacific Forum has voted in support of the sanctuary proposal. I can now indicate to the Senate that the Hon. Sandra Lee, the minister from New Zealand, will be joining me in Adelaide to present the case as will the Hon. Elliot Morley, the UK fisheries minister. </para><para>I am pleased also to inform the Senate that the initiative will be co-sponsored by the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Brazil and Monaco. The sanctuary will deliver both biodiversity conservation and economic benefits to communities in the South Pacific. Whale watching in Tonga already generates significant economic benefits for local Tongan communities and there is potential for the whale watching industry to expand in the South Pacific if whale numbers can recover. I am also pleased that the Australian community has expressed its overwhelming support for the sanctuary and for the government's ultimate goal of a permanent end to commercial whaling. Last week I received a petition from Greenpeace signed by 137,000 Australians in support of a global sanctuary. A coalition of environment groups and community groups is actively supporting the sanctuary proposal and I take this opportunity to express the government's appreciation.</para><para>I also take the opportunity to announce that the government is providing over $380,000 in funding for projects to enhance protection for whales in Australian waters. These projects will bring together federal and state governments, scientists, community groups and the fishing industry to further protect humpback, southern right whales and blue whales. The projects include: surveying the ecology and feeding behaviour of blue whales in Victorian waters with the assistance of local fishermen, identifying important habitat of the southern right whale for protection, enhancing protection for whales in the Southern Ocean and monitoring humpback whales along the Queensland coast and Western Australian coast.  </para><para>The coalition has a proud record of whale conservation. It was the Fraser government that first banned commercial whaling in Australian waters. The Howard government has again taken up the cause of whale conservation both domestically and internationally. There is no need to kill whales. We do not need whales for food or any other product and we certainly do not need to kill whales in the name of science. We will continue to push for a permanent global ban on commercial whaling so that the great whales can roam the world's oceans free from the threat of commercial exploitation.

This is nothing more than a smokescreen. We have seen the petrol promise: Prime Minister John Howard in August 1998 in an address to the nation said, `The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.' The challenge tonight is: will he say that again? And the answer is: no, he won't. We all know now that petrol prices on the weekend, from 1 July, will be going up between 1c and 2c because this government has broken its promise. It has nowhere to run and nowhere to hide—it has broken its promise. Even Allan Fels, when he has been called in to make the petrol companies give up the 1½c to 2c, will not swallow this one. It cannot even get its poodle Fels to make the oil companies give the 1½c. </para><para>Then there is beer—and we have already seen Senator Kemp, again, get the fig leaf out to cover himself. This is what the Prime Minister said on the John Laws program: `There'll be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer.' There was no dissembling about packaged beer. There was no mention of that on the John Laws program. But what are we seeing? An eight per cent increase. Then yesterday we saw that bank fees and charges are set to rise—slugged again. This government again ran and hid behind who? Allan Fels. Allan Fels has already been in negotiations with the banks, and this government knows that when Fels finishes his investigation the government will be exposed again. The government told us before the last election that banks would save $600 million, which amounted to about a four to five per cent fall in the costs for banking that it said would be passed on to customers in `lower' fees and charges.

On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program he was like a rabbit in the spotlight. Laurie Oakes had him absolutely pinned. Laurie Oakes kept asking, `Where will these cost savings come from for the oil companies?' He said, `Treasury have done some modelling about it.' We have all seen the Treasury modelling. It is actually displayed in the ANTS package. The Prime Minister and Senator Kemp continue to refuse to acknowledge that when Treasury does its modelling it uses a model called PRISMOD. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We had a lengthy debate with Treasury about the assumptions that underpin the economic model called PRISMOD. What Treasury admitted was that it assumes 100 per cent flow through of all cost savings on day one—that is, 1 July. That is the same as saying that companies will knock down their refineries and build new ones and sell every truck and buy new ones—replace every single item that they have. That is the only way you can get this 100 per cent assumption to work in the real world. We all know that that is an absolute farce, and John Howard knows that that is a farce. But will he cough up? Will he admit it? No. The PRISMOD modelling projects cost savings in the long run—in five to eight years. John Howard is saying, `Petrol companies will give you today savings that they are going to make in five years time.' He knows he cannot do it. There is no law that allows him to do it. The ACCC will not do it. Allan Fels will not do it. But what was the other great lie? The government will not let the petrol price differential widen between city and country. What is happening now? The petrol price differential between city and country is widening. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>16020</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For Senator Cook to say that the GST is going to go and for the Leader of the Opposition in the other place to say that it is not going to go is more than just a dichotomy. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—What are you talking about, Ross? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—Well, you have the two fiscal bandits who said that the 1995-96 budget was a balanced budget, and now these two fiscal bandits are again saying something quite opposite: one is saying that the GST is going to be kept and the other one is saying that it is not going to be kept. What is going to happen? I will tell you what is going to happen: the GST will stay. We know that this is a Howard-Lees-Beazley GST and it is going to stay. But it is going to be rolled back, and why is it going to be rolled back? Because we have promised to reduce income tax rates to 30 per cent for 80 per cent of the wage earners—and we represent the wages earners of Australia. There is no question that the Liberal Party and the coalition represent the wage earners of Australia. We will reduce income tax rates to 30 per cent; you will put them up again. They will go north. That is what you will do—roll back the GST and income tax will go north again. What will happen with the halving of capital gains tax? Your side introduced capital gains tax when you were in government. We had abolished capital gains tax for most transactions; you will make sure that the capital gains tax rate of 25 per cent goes north again. What will you do with company tax? We propose to drop company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent; you will increase company tax—it will go north again. How are you going to cover it?

But it is important, when you proceed to do that, to tell the people the truth about what you are going to foist upon them.

Well, the fig leaf might cover Senator Kemp, but it will not cover this hoax. We only have to go back to the statements previously made by government ministers, the Prime Minister and, indeed, government members—be they senators or members in the other place. I want to go back and keep reminding the government of what the Prime Minister said back in August 1998, as Senator Conroy has already pointed out. This goes to the question of petrol prices and this is about a government keeping its promises. We keep hearing from the government that they are going to keep their promises. Well, let me put this to the government senators who are absent from the chamber.

The government had previously claimed that rents would only go up somewhere in the order of two per cent—that was going to be the price effect of the GST. When the modelling became publicly available, what did it show? Over double. That is a real challenge for the government here. If the Prime Minister wants to claim to be so honest, and if the Treasurer and the other government members want to claim that what they are telling the people is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, then release the modelling. That is what you should do. You should front up to your responsibility and, if you are going to foist a hoax upon the people of this country come Saturday, then you ought to own up to it and be honest with them, for a start—because that is what you are trying to do.</para><para>Finally, with regard to bank fees, the Colonial State Bank, which is now to become the Commonwealth Bank, may not have made a public statement about putting up their fees, but they have certainly written to every business, advising them of significant changes.

A decision to formally recognise or define the role of parent support groups in the intercountry adoption area is a matter for the Council.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2.67	The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">the Commonwealth coordinate a process with State and Territory Governments and all relevant organisations to ensure that all current intercountry adoption agreements comply with the requirements of the Convention prior to the expiry of the three year transitional period.</inline></para><para>The Government will undertake a review of current bilateral arrangements relating to intercountry adoption to ensure consistency with the Convention.</para><para>Decisions on whether bilateral arrangements should be formalised (para 2.50) and whether parent support groups should be involved in this process (para 2.51) are matters on which the views of State and Territory Governments need to be obtained. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2.69	The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">the Attorney-General's Department act to improve the consultation process regarding the implementation of this agreement so that it is timely and includes all interested parties.</inline></para><para>The Government considers that the consultation process followed in relation to the implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption has been completed in a timely fashion and appropriately took account of the views of interested non-government organisations.</para><para>In relation to the consultation undertaken prior to implementation, the Government notes that, pursuant to the Community Services Ministers Council decision, the States and Territories undertook their own consultation processes in their respective jurisdictions. While the consultation processes were consequently varied, these variations did not result in any failure by State, Territory or Commonwealth agencies to identify or consider any significant issues relating to the implementation of the Convention. Subsequent to implementation, the Commonwealth, States and Territories have engaged in broader non-government organisation (NGO) consultation on a range of issues arising from the arrangements for the Convention.</para><para>The Government wishes to clarify information as to the process by which the legislation implementing the Convention was made available to interested parties (see para 2.56 of the Committee's report). The Commonwealth Regulations were circulated by State and Territory Governments to NGOs in December 1997. The NGOs then provided their comments to State and Commonwealth agencies. In March 1998, the Office of the Commonwealth Attorney-General wrote to interested NG0s to advise that, while some change would be made to the Regulations, there would be no changes in relation to the significant matters raised in the NGOs' comments. A copy of the draft Commonwealth Regulations was made available to the Committee on 30 March 1998. As soon as Commonwealth drafting priorities allowed, a revised version of the Regulations was distributed to NGOs and the Committee in late May 1998.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Denunciation of ILO Convention No. 9</inline></para><para>The Government notes the Committee's views on the denunciation of ILO Convention No. 9 and provides the following responses to its recommendations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3.45	The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties notes the information it has received, and recommends that ILO Convention No. 9 be denounced.</inline></para><para>The Government welcomes the Committee's support for its denunciation of ILO Convention No. 9. Australia's instrument of denunciation was deposited with the ILO on 31 August 1998 to take effect from 31 August 1999. The instrument of denunciation was accompanied by a Statement of Reasons (text follows), in accordance with usual ILO practice.</para><para>ILO Convention No. 9 Placing of Seamen, 1920, provides that the business of finding employment for seafarers shall not be carried on by commercial enterprise for pecuniary gain and that fees shall not be charged, directly or indirectly, for finding employment for seafarers on any ship. It provides for the establishment and operation of an adequate system of public employment offices for finding employment for seafarers without charge. Such officers are to be organised and maintained either by representative associations of shipowners and seafarers jointly under the control of a central authority, or by the national government. Australia became a party to the Convention on 3 August 1925.</para><para>The Government of Australia has decided to denounce the Convention, following a process of consultation and consideration in relation to reforms aimed at improving the international competitiveness of Australian shipping. These reforms were recommended to the Government by an advisory body, the Shipping Reform Group, comprising key maritime industry executives.</para><para>In March 1997, the Government received the Shipping Reform Group report recommending significant and constructive reforms aimed at halting the rapid reduction in the Australian trading fleet and ensuring the survival of the industry. A critical element of these reforms involved proposed changes to the labour market for seafarers, including the extension of company-based employment to all seafarers. Consequently, the industry based employment arrangements for ratings, which were then administered by the Government in consultation with the shipowners' and seafarers' organisations, would be abolished.</para><para>The report concluded that the industry employment arrangements for ratings seafarers failed to provide the flexibility necessary for Australian ship operators to compete effectively with overseas operators. They were found to inhibit employment continuity for seafarers, increase training costs, prevent transfer of ratings between each ship operator's vessels, involve both inadequate selected arrangements and barriers to promotion for seafarers and impose on the industry additional administrative costs of the system.</para><para>In addition, independent reports to the Government highlighted an adverse impact of the industry employment arrangements on occupational health and safety outcomes in the maritime industry. The introduction of company-based employment for all seafarers was seen by the industry as important in helping to reduce the current high incidence of work-related injury and disease. This results from the improved selection of seafarers to suit the physical demands of particular seagoing jobs and allowing specialised training to be provided to seafarers who have a full time commitment to their employment with a particular ship operator. </para><para>The Government concluded that implementation of the labour market reforms, including company-based employment, recommended by the Shipping Reform Group was essential to improve the efficiency of Australian shipping.  In view of the industry proceeding to negotiate implementation of these reforms, the Government decided to withdraw from further involvement in operating the particular public employment services for seafarers which were part of the substantive requirements of ILO Convention No. 9, as from 1 March 1998.</para><para>Accordingly, it is necessary to denounce ILO Convention No. 9, as recruitment and placement of seafarers in Australia are not being conducted in the manner required by the Convention.  It is no longer relevant to Australia's shipping industry and has become redundant with the abolition of the system of public employment offices for seafarers.</para><para>Under company-based employment arrangements, seafarers are to be recruited and placed through direct contact between shipowners and seafarers, which may include private arrangements between shipowners' and seafarers' organisations and private agencies.</para><para>In accordance with ILO Convention No. 144, Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards), 1976, the Australian Government has consulted with the relevant representative employer and worker organisations, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), concerning the denunciation of ILO Convention No. 9.</para><para>The ACCI advised that it had no objection to the Government's proposed course of action.  Both the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) commented that there had been insufficient consultation with the shipping industry on the proposal and they did not support the denunciation of ILO Convention No. 9. The MUA also objected to the denunciation proceeding unless the Government agreed to progress other measures recommended by the Shipping Reform Group (including fiscal support for the shipping industry) at the same time. The MUA also protested against the Government's decision to withdraw from administration of the industry employment system prior to the industry finalising company based employment arrangements.</para><para>The Government firmly believes the move to full company employment of seafarers and the dismantling of the industry-based employment system for ratings, which was intrinsic to Australia's ability to demonstrate compliance with the ILO Convention No. 9, are crucial reform measures.  The Government is convinced that this denunciation, which arises in an environment quite different to that applicable when the Convention was adopted and ratified, is a necessary adjunct to this reform as its provisions are no longer appropriate to the modern Australian shipping industry.</para><para>ILO Convention No. 179, Recruitment and Placement of Seafarers, 1996 revises Convention No. 9. The Government of Australia is determining its attitude towards ratification of ILO Convention No. 179 in light of an examination of the compliance of Australian law and practice with this Convention.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3.46	The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties also recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">proper consideration be given to the adoption of ILO Convention No. 179 with the aim of ratification by the time ILO Convention No. 9 is denounced.</inline></para><para>Following consultations, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business carried out an assessment of ILO Convention No. 179, Recruitment and Placement of Seafarers, 1996 which revealed significant compliance issues with the Convention, in particular the requirement for the competent authority to 'closely supervise all recruitment and placement services'.</para><para>It would be contrary to the Government's treaty-making policy to initiate ratification of an ILO Convention without establishing that there is compliance with its provisions, and that compliance will be able to be maintained. As the Government is not able to demonstrate compliance with the ambitious provisions of ILO Convention No. 179, Australia is not considering ratification.</para><para>ILO Convention No. 179, other ILO maritime instruments and an accompanying report, were tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 9 December 1998, in accordance with Australia's obligation under Article 19 of the ILO Constitution, which requires member States to bring newly-adopted instruments to the notice of the 'competent authority'. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dissenting Report</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The 15th Report of the JSCOT included a Dissenting Report on the proposal to denounce ILO Convention No. 9. The conclusions of, and Government response to the Dissenting Report are as follows.</inline></para><para>1.45 The Federal Government has acted with undue and unnecessary haste in its decision to denounce ILO Convention No. 9. No consultation occurred prior to the Government's decision to denounce the treaty. Such consultation as has occurred since that decision was made has been totally inadequate and in the case of the WA, which represents workers in the relevant industry, has been non-existent.</para><para>This assertion is inaccurate. The Government fulfilled its IL0 obligation to consult with the most representative employer and worker organisations. The ACTU is representative of workers in relation to all ILO matters and the ACTU advice of 25 March 1998 incorporated the views of its affiliates including the WA.</para><para>1.47  Having made the decision to denounce ILO Convention No. 9 however, it is now imperative that the Government acts swiftly to ratify ILO Convention No. 179.</para><para>For the reasons expressed above, the Government is not considering ratification of IL0 Convention No. 179.</para><para>6.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</inline></para><para>The Government notes the support of the Committee for the ratification of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty which was ratified on 9 July 1998.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">4.59	The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">once the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 is enacted, the Presiding Officers write jointly to the President of the United States Senate to acquaint that Chamber with the views of the Australian Parliament, as expressed in the Act, and urge them to take all steps to facilitate and expedite ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty by the United States of America.</inline></para><para>The Government welcomes the above recommendation which is fully consistent with the Government's policy on the CTBT and its own actions.  Further, the Government notes that ratification of the CTBT is an objective shared explicitly by the US Administration.  The Joint Communiqué issued at the conclusion of the 1998 Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations on 31 July 1998 made clear US and Australian commitment to the CTBT: 'The United States congratulated Australia for its ratification of the CTBT.

(para 7.130)</inline></para><para>It is normal practice for the remains of Commonwealth Service personnel, whether positively identified or otherwise, to be interred in the nearest Commonwealth War Graves Commission war cemetery to the place of death. This policy has been evidenced in recent years by the remains of aircrew recovered from the wreckage of their aircraft in the jungle of Papua New Guinea being buried in the closest Commonwealth War Graves Commission war cemetery to where their remains were found. The Department of Defence arranged in each case for a military funeral service to be conducted at the gravesite, in the presence of relatives.</para><para>In the case of the remains washed ashore on Christmas Island, should they be proven to come from HMAS Sydney, there is no way of knowing the place of death, save for at sea. In these circumstances, it is reasonable that the remains be interred in a mainland war cemetery closest to the area of death. The closest war cemetery on the mainland to Christmas Island is the Geraldton War Cemetery. However, it could be argued that it is appropriate that any remains be interred in the Perth War Cemetery.</para><para>It is possible the family may wish the remains to stay where they have lain on Christmas Island for the past 57 years. If this were the case, Office of Australian War Graves would, on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, mark the grave, record its location and maintain it in perpetuity.</para><para>Should any remains be located and removed from Christmas Island, it is not the responsibility of the Office of Australian War Graves to erect a memorial cairn marking the original burial site.</para><para>If the remains are identified as an Australian serviceman, but their identity is not established, they should be removed to the closest Commonwealth War Graves Commission war cemetery for burial.</para><para>If the remains are not identified as an Australian serviceman, they should be reinterred on Christmas Island. In this scenario, the marking of the grave is not a matter for the Office of Australian War Graves.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10. The Committee recommends that the Royal Australian Navy sponsor a seminar on the likely search areas for Sydney and Kormoran, involving as many of the individual researchers and groups as possible. (para 8.59)</inline></para><para>Navy agrees with the proposal to sponsor a seminar in Western Australia which should focus only on issues related directly to the location and discovery of the wreck. Proposals for presentations should be assessed by a committee including representatives from Navy, the Western Australian Maritime Museum and the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11. The Committee recommends that after the search area is more accurately defined, some preliminary surveys, be undertaken to try and confirm the accuracy of the wreck locations, prior to a full in-water search. An initial search for HSK Kormoran at or near 26°32-34'S, 111°E, if supported by the seminar, would seem a logical starting point. (para 8.61)</inline></para><para>After the seminar the final recommendations will be provided to the Chief of Navy and Maritime Commander for evaluation as to their appropriateness as a basis for a search. Any final decision on Navy involvement will need to take into account the potential size of the search area, Navy capabilities, national tasking requirements and resource implications.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12. The Committee recommends that the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust and the Australian Government negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding governing the search for, and subsequent protection of, the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran. (para 8.94)</inline></para><para>The Government questions the need for a separate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust. The Trust signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Australian Maritime Museum in 1997. Prior to signature the then Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Defence were given the opportunity to comment on the MOU. At the request of the Department of Communications and the Arts certain points were inserted into the MOU to ensure that it was recognised that the Western Australian Maritime Museum was acting both on its own part and also as an agent of the Commonwealth under the Historic Shipwrecks Act.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13. The Committee recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(a)	the Australian Government provide an initial grant to the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust of $100,000 to cover activities associated with defining the search area, with a report on its expenditure to be provided to the Australian Government; and</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(b)	the Australian Government match public donations, on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a total of $2 million. (para 8.96) </inline></para><para>The Government does not support the proposal but is prepared to provide assistance as indicated in its responses to the other recommendations in the report.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 14. The Committee recommends that:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(a)	should the wrecks of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran be located in Australian waters, they be declared wrecks of historical significance, under the terms of the Historic Shipwrecks Act; and </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(b)	the Minister for the Environment and Heritage make a declaration creating a protected zone around the site of the wrecks. (para 8.104) </inline></para><para>Given the extent of public interest in the fate of HMAS Sydney and HSK Kormoran, and the historical significance of their engagement, consideration would be given to declaring the vessels to be historic shipwrecks under s.5 of the Act if they are found to lie within Commonwealth jurisdiction inside Australian territorial waters as defined in s.2(5) of the Act, or within the territorial sea of an Australian External Territory. Additional protection could be provided by the declaration of a protective zone around the vessels under s.7 of the Act.</para><para>Should the vessels be found to lie outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, there is currently no international instrument compelling their protection in international waters. A UNESCO Draft Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is presently in the process of negotiation. It may be some time before this is completed and ratified.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15. The Committee recommends that in addition to consultations with the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust on a management plan for the wreck sites, the Western Australian Maritime Museum also consult with the Royal Australian Navy, community groups and other stakeholders.

The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments jointly fund the construction of a memorial to HMAS Sydney, to be erected in Fremantle, with the memorial to be dedicated on 19 November 2001. (para 9.15)</inline></para><para>The Government is not opposed to the construction of such a memorial but does not support the recommendation that it be funded wholly by the Commonwealth and West Australian Governments. Such memorials are not usually funded by government except for those few memorials in Anzac Parade, Canberra, erected on behalf of the three Services or those small memorials erected in the memorial gardens of the Australian War Memorial. </para><para>Major commemorative war memorials, including those designated as national memorials, are funded by public subscription and managed by a committee representing the special interest groups concerned with the particular memorial. Federal and State governments may donate generously to these fund-raising campaigns but do not fund such memorials in their entirety. Such management committees as are elected, or appointed, take responsibility for every aspect of the memorial from design through to dedication. Even in the case of national memorials, the role of government is limited to policy oversight, management of construction contracts and maintenance of the memorial in perpetuity.</para><para>The Commonwealth War Graves Commission already officially commemorates those who perished on HMAS Sydney on the Naval Memorials to the Missing in Plymouth, United Kingdom. They are also individually commemorated on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial.</para><para>The Western Australian Maritime Museum is planning a Naval display for the new maritime museum, including reference to the social impact of the loss of HMAS Sydney and the ongoing interest in locating the two vessels involved in the conflict. In addition, the Maritime Museum Library has been collecting records about the HMAS Sydney and will continue to do this.</para><para>The Maritime Museum has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust. In the MOU, the Museum states that it intends to `jointly consider ways that the Trustees may establish an active centre of remembrance that may be based within the State'. `Centre of remembrance' is defined as a `place dedicated to promoting remembrance of the battle and those lost in the battle, that may provide displays of historical artefacts and information, films, multimedia and or other activities such as research, sponsorship of research, debates or forums'.</para><para>The HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust has also committed to create programs of long term commemoration of HMAS Sydney and the sailors who lost their lives in the battle. A virtual memorial, consisting of information technology rather than granite, is among the programs considered by the Trust. Although the Maritime Museum has no plans for a physical memorial to the Sydney, it sees strong potential benefits in a Web Site.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 17.

On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</para><para>The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit until recently have usually been made in the form of Finance Minutes which have been tabled by the committee. Such responses are now made in the form of Executive Minutes. Where a response has been made by way of Executive Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</para><para>Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A guide to the legend used in the `Date response presented/made to the Senate' column</inline></para><para>* See document tabled in the Senate on 28 June 2000, entitled Government Responses to Parliamentary Committee Reports-Response to the schedule tabled by the President on 8 December 1999, for Government interim/final response.

I want to make some comments about the position we are finally taking here on this bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000, and the view of the government that these amendments not be insisted upon. If this bill is held up—because the Senate would vote to uphold our position—it will be because this government is unwilling to protect the entitlements of aged pensioners, widows and people with disabilities. These are people who will have reduced portability as a result of the changes the government is seeking to make, and they are the reason Labor moved the amendments it did. Labor supports those measures that will see people gain additional entitlements to allowances. We are keen to see these new entitlements delivered, but we do not want to see that paid off by reductions elsewhere.</para></talk.start><para>Our amendments have been carefully constructed not to upset the beneficial measures in this bill relating to portability. We have not breached the process of simplification being undertaken by the government in relation to portability. The government is locating portability rules centrally to assist decision making. Our amendments do not change this process. The government is not moving to a system where every recipient will have identical entitlements. There remain different conditions for different classes of recipients. Within that framework Labor has sought to amend the bill to protect existing conditions where they are to be diminished. The Welfare Rights Organisation, in a submission to the Senate committee, has indicated that there are even likely to be savings to government in some cases where existing portability is retained. This is because some social security recipients will ultimately draw their pensions from other countries when, if they were asked to remain in Australia through stricter portability rules, they would be drawing payments here.</para><para>We do not think on financial grounds or any other grounds the government's intentions are far from Labor's when it comes to portability. We are not talking about a great number of people. Many of those we are trying to protect are receiving pensions that will cease to exist in a matter of a few years. We should also be realistic about the fact that not many pensioners have the financial wherewithal to travel overseas. For these reasons, generous portability arrangements are a small entitlement. But that does not diminish the importance of having a flexible mechanism that allows people with sick or dying relatives or a chronic illness themselves the flexibility to travel overseas for extended periods. </para><para>There seems little point in the government not agreeing to meet us halfway on this issue. Our amendments are not designed to frustrate the government nor to delay this bill. Their intention is to ensure that in an otherwise positive bill some individuals are not hurt in the process. In conclusion, we believe the government is being a little pig-headed here in not accepting our modest amendments. They are not a great cost to the budget; they affect a small number, as we said before when we first moved these amendments.</para><para>However, because the government is unyielding on this matter, we are put in the position where, if the Senate insists on these amendments and the bill does not go through, other benefits and improvements in benefits to recipients will be delayed at least until we return in August. We know that the government would, for its own political purposes, cynically try to say that that was our fault. Therefore, with considerable reluctance, the opposition is not going to insist on its amendments. But we still believe the merit of our amendments is excellent, and we are just surprised the government would not accept them to make it a better bill in the end.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>16042</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will put the Democrats position on the record in relation to this issue of whether or not the Senate should insist on its amendments, which were originally moved by the ALP. Obviously, my position is fairly academic, given the opposition's decision not to insist on its amendments. I certainly share the disappointment expressed by Senator Schacht in the lack of flexibility of the government on the issues contained in these amendments. They are not major, but they certainly would have been of assistance.</para></talk.start><para>I am particularly disappointed that there was no recognition of the value of amendments Nos 4 through to 10. The argument the government insists on—that those amendments, which retain the 12-month non-portability period for former returning residents, rather than two years, are inconsistent with the residence principle of the new system—is a fairly glib way of dismissing what is a fairly important aspect of those amendments that retain the 12 months non-portability and really does not go any way towards acknowledging the reasons why it would be more appropriate to retain that at 12 months.</para><para>The government also comments in its reasons that the amendment would also retain a discretion which is presently open to abuse. I hope that is not a sign that the government is now going to feel that every discretionary power of the secretary to the department in relation to other payments is now going to be labelled as a potential for abuse. Clearly, in any system you need a situation with discretion, where you have some flexibility and ability to deal with difficult cases which do not necessarily fit the neat confines of the act. I find that reason that has been given by the House of Representatives as to why they opposed one of these amendments to be fairly inadequate and a bit curious.</para><para>However, the bill overall will now go through unamended. It is disappointing that the government is not willing to take on board genuine concerns that are expressed and outlined not just by senators but by groups in the community that work with this very large and complex act every day. However, that is the case, and that is the situation we are faced with. Certainly the Democrats also are disappointed that the government continues to refuse to accept these improvements. Again, amendments Nos 4 to 10 would have been particularly beneficial to have in as amendments to the bill. But that is the way it is. Given that we have a lot of other bills to deal with today, I will not detain the Senate by speaking further on the matter. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>16043</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions. In very brief response to Senator Bartlett, there is no intention by the government to move to remove the secretary's discretion in the department. There is a change in this piece of legislation, but it does not signal a change of direction on secretaries' discretion.</para></talk.start><para>Briefly at the beginning, Senator Schacht was perhaps confusing eligibility criteria with conditions on payment. We recognise, of course, that there are many different payments for which there are great variations in the eligibility criteria. But what we are trying to do in simplifying here is to have conditions across the payments consistent in the opportunity that go with the eligibility.</para><para>It is very important that I once again emphasise that we have a very significant measure in this bill which has been long wanted by people, and that is the ability to still receive rent assistance and pharmaceutical allowance while out of the country. I certainly have had numbers and numbers of people over the 4½ years I have had this job asking us to review that policy. It is something that could have been on the priority list for the previous government but was not. But it has now reached its place here.</para><para>Can I say that I think the opposition's decision on this legislation is a wise one. This is an important bill. It does have significant measures in it. Simplification may not be quite as sexy as some other things, but in practical terms it is very important for people who need income support from the public purse, and it is very conducive to better and more accurate administration of the system, which of course goes to benefiting those who have applied for assistance.</para><para>I also want to emphasise that this is not a savings measure. The simplification of portability is not a savings measure; it is a fiscally neutral measure. Savings from the international payment measure flow from the extension of the requirement to claim a comparable foreign payment to non-agreement countries, not from any other element. Without further ado, I welcome the fact that the opposition is not insisting on its amendments. I commend the bill to the chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the Senate not insist upon its amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16043</page.no><id.no>R1038</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1040</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>16043</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><para>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</para><para>(Quorum formed)</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>16043</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are two amendments. The first amendment relates to the issue of the stay of proceedings. The Senate will recall that before the suspension of the sitting for lunch we took the view—I think it was all parties—that there was a concern that the ability to seek an injunction to restrain a decision of the ABA or to put that decision on hold pending litigation or pending an appeal from that decision could mean that many months might elapse, during which time something ultimately found to have offended against the regime would still be in place and could lead to other pressures for that regime to become permanent in practice, even to the point of encouraging the parliament to legislate to allow something that the ABA itself had found went beyond the terms of the datacasting regime.</para></talk.start><para>It is clearly a principle of law that one should not be arbitrarily denied one's legal rights, and principles of natural justice would, I think, come into play as well. It is certainly common practice that courts have a discretion as to whether to grant a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of an appeal. However, in criminal proceedings—say, a murder conviction—it would be very rare indeed if a convicted person were allowed to go free on bail pending the outcome of an appeal which might not come on for many months. I am not even sure that there wasn't a time in Victoria when you simply couldn't, by law, have a stay of proceedings once you had been found guilty, which in effect was a very big incentive for the courts to ensure that the full court dealt with matters very quickly. I cannot speak for current practice because it is now some 14 years since I was last in practice, but certainly I think the principle has always been that one should be very loath indeed to interfere with normal appeal rights and therefore injunctive relief that might accompany those rights. Therefore, I think the view was taken in this chamber that, if there were a middle course, it would enable us to ensure that injunctive relief would be available but not indefinitely to the point where it might effectively overturn a decision of the tribunal in the first instance or the ABA. </para><para>So the solution being proposed is that a decision of the ABA could not be injuncted for a period of time greater than three months. After that time, if the matter has not been dealt with by way of appeal, the injunction would lapse and the original decision would be resumed. We do this by way of an amendment to schedule 1, item 140, page 92, to substitute provisions which include the following: that an order must not be made, under paragraph 15(1)(a) or 15A(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in relation to an eligible decision if (a) the order has the effect of suspending the operation of the eligible decision for more than 3 months; or (b) the order and any previous order or orders made under the paragraph concerned have the combined effect of suspending the operation of the eligible decision for more than three months.</para><para>In other words, you could have a limited stay, pending a hearing. The courts are therefore on notice that, unless the hearings are brought on quickly, you would in effect be reverting to the original decision. That still does not preclude the appeal coming on in due course, but the holding arrangements would have altered. You would then be proceeding on the basis that the ABA's judgment was the status quo rather than the result of the injunction, which would normally be the opposite. We do think this offers a sensible middle course; it does provide an opportunity for the parties to exercise all their rights, but not in an unlimited fashion. If the wheels of justice turn in the way they should, you will find that appeals are dealt with within that three-month period and these orders would not need to have effect, because you would not reach that point of reversion. So I would hope that these latest amendments—and I am grateful to other parties in the Senate for allowing us time to ensure properly reflect that outcome—will achieve what we had in mind. I seek leave to move government amendments Nos 1 and 2 from sheet DW210 together.</para><para>Leave granted. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 140, page 92 (lines 14 to 25), omit subclauses (2), (3) and (4), substitute:</para><para>	(2)	An order must not be made under paragraph 15(1)(a) or 15A(1)(a) of the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</inline> in relation to an eligible decision if:</para><para>	(a)	the order has the effect of suspending the operation of the eligible decision for more than 3 months;

I cannot help but feel that the whole process here has been one where we have been transferring the obligation to make decisions onto the ABA, and that is not a good process. To then find ourselves having to come up with complicated dispute resolutions after that point highlights that. As the minister said, the difficulty is that, if there isn't good dispute resolution, you are left in the position where pressure might come upon the parliament to legislate. I do not mind pressure being brought on, and there is no worry about legislating. The thing is that you are doing the right thing by Australian consumers, and the best way to ensure that that is done is to do it at the outset.

The Senate has already passed Labor amendment No. 1 on sheet 1823, which would have the effect of allowing the ABC and SBS to provide multichannel programs.</para><para>These amendments would amend the provisions in Labor amendment No. 1 relating to multichannelling by the national broadcasters and would also make a number of important consequential changes to other provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act that are needed to give effect to such multichannelling. The amendments add a new clause 5A to schedule 4 which provides for a multichannel national television broadcasting service which includes a range of classes of programs, as prescribed in clause 5A(2). Speaking in general terms for a moment, I might just say that the object of the exercise is to enable the ABC and SBS to multichannel—in other words, to provide programs on a second standard definition channel. This would enable them to provide services in a whole range of areas that I think ordinary Australians would instinctively recognise as being very much in the domain of the national broadcasters, particularly in the information and education sectors. The ABC has always quite rightly prided itself on offering quite a diverse range of programming that is outside the mainstream occupied by the commercial networks, and the raison d'etre of the ABC in many respects is to be a quality alternative.</para><para>This new regime will enable the ABC and SBS to do their own thing but not to do it in such a way that they are simply moving into domains which are very well catered for by the commercial sector, particularly sport, films and the like. The programs that would be permitted under these amendments include: news and current affairs dealing with regional matters, educational programs, science programs, religious programs, health programs, art related programs, culture related programs, financial market or business information programs, programs which broadcast parliamentary proceedings and certain court proceedings, public policy programs—some of these, including public policy programs, are defined in one of the amendments—foreign language news bulletins, programs relating to community based multicultural activity, children's programs, history programs, programs produced by the ABC dealing with international programs, international news, programs about rural affairs, information only programs—and, again, that is as defined in the datacasting regime—stand-alone international social documentaries, stand-alone social documentaries produced by SBS, subtitled foreign language programs and occasional stand-alone dramas. </para><para>Quite clearly, it is a very exhaustive list. It provides innumerable opportunities for innovative broadcasting, which I am sure is a principle close to the heart of Senator Bourne in particular. That is something we would expect to emerge from the new digital television era. I have every confidence that all of the broadcasters, particularly those who pride themselves on having new and distinctive areas which will not necessarily be of interest to mainstream audiences but nonetheless will be recognised for their creativity and inventiveness, will be able to present such programs as a result of the implementation of the legislation and this very extensive list. </para><para>Other provisions in clause 5A would ensure that the ABC and SBS still comply with the basic simulcast requirements related to the digital conversion process. Amendment No. 6 amends item 123 of the bill that was substituted by the previously agreed Labor amendment No. 1 on sheet 1823. Amendment No. 11 inserts a new section 100D into the Radiocommunications Act to ensure that the transmitter licences authorising digital television transmissions by the ABC and SBS also allow the transmission of multichannel television services. The other amendments are consequential and ensure, for example, that the HDTV requirements in the bill do not apply to a multichannelled service.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16050</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As we have gone through the deliberations on the <inline ref="R1038">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000</inline> over the last five or six weeks, one of the critical issues that the opposition have been keen to pursue is the future of multichannelling for the national broadcasters. It became an important issue in the Senate inquiry, which spread over two days, and has been at the forefront of our thinking and our deliberations as this bill has been discussed in the chamber over the last three days. We were always keen for the ABC and the SBS to have the right to multichannel because we saw it as an emerging development that the national broadcasters should be able to get into to give effect to their charter and to serve the interests of the Australian community. So multichannelling for the national broadcasters has been a key issue, and our policy position remains that the national broadcasters should be able to multichannel in an unencumbered way within their charters.</para></talk.start><para>In the public discussions associated with this bill, we have obviously urged that approach on the government. Even as we have been concluding the committee stage this morning, we have again urged that approach on the government. Over lunchtime, there were some discussions among the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats, and at those discussions the government rejected the proposition that the Australian Labor Party had been putting concerning the future of multichannelling for the national broadcasters. Instead, the government came back with an alternative position, which is essentially a list of items that the national broadcasters would be able to multichannel. As the minister said, those items are referred to in amendment No. 3, subparagraph (2) and relate to the whole range of matters he read out. Essentially, it is a list of items that the national broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS, would be permitted to multichannel. The government urged upon the opposition acceptance of that position. The government advised the opposition and the Democrats that they had had some discussions, consultations or negotiations with the ABC and the SBS and that those two organisations had indicated to the government that they were happy with the list approach of the government, that they accepted it and that it comprehensively covered the fields of activity in which the ABC and the SBS were engaged and wished to be engaged in the future. On that basis, the government urged that the opposition accept the list approach as opposed to the carte blanche approach contained in the bill to date.</para><para>We made our own inquiries of the ABC and the SBS, and representatives of those organisations informed us that the position put by the government had been agreed with them and was acceptable to those two organisations. They said that they were prepared to accept the list of items contained in the amending bill before us today and outlined by the minister. So we were not informed of any problem that the ABC or the SBS had in respect of the list approach, and they urged upon us that it should be accepted. In a perfect world, the opposition would have preferred to have remained with the carte blanche approach that was passed in the relevant amendment to the bill earlier today giving the national broadcasters the right to multichannel. But the permissible list does go to the heart of the activity of both the ABC and the SBS. </para><para>The critical issues in the mind of the opposition were, firstly, the resolution of the issue of multichannelling—having had the ABC and the SBS advise us that they were prepared to accept the list—and, secondly, if we had chosen not to accept their advice and to reject the bill brought forward by the government, the determination of a way of avoiding a possible impasse between the two houses if the matter had remained unamended at this stage, had gone back to the House of Representatives, had been rejected in that place and had then been referred back to the Senate. We were unable to come up with a way to resolve that possible impasse, and we are very aware of the importance of this bill—soon to be an act—to the industry generally. For those reasons, the opposition are prepared to support the amendments that are before the chamber today. Whilst the list is quite detailed and might be regarded as exhaustive, it has no impact at all on the material broadcast by the primary channels of both the ABC and the SBS. Whatever material they currently broadcast in terms of drama, sitcoms, movies or whatever is not in any way affected by the bill. With those comments, I advise that the opposition will support passage of these amendments in due course.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>16051</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find these amendments bizarre. In fact, I find the whole procedure that we are going through at the moment bizarre. We dealt with the whole question of ABC and SBS multichannelling two days ago—or maybe it was yesterday; everything is melting together in my mind. It was quite recently. If the government had an amendment to the Democrat and opposition ABC and SBS multichannelling amendments at that time, why didn't they bring it up? These are very long, detailed amendments. The government suddenly thought, `Oh dear, we didn't think this would happen. Wow, how did this happen? How did a majority of the representatives of the Australian people suddenly vote for multichannelling for the ABC and SBS? We had no idea that was going to happen. Good gracious, we had better get some amendments together. We had better do it overnight. We had better get them onto the floor of the chamber. We had better not tell anybody about this until lunchtime before we do it and after the bill is finished.' I find the whole thing quite bizarre.</para></talk.start><para>At lunchtime, for the first time ever, I found out that the government has these amendments which very strongly restrict the amendment which the Labor Party and the Democrats proposed and which was passed very recently by a majority of the Senate. At lunchtime I got this list, and I was told, `The government thinks we should vote for it.' Great. You have to ask why this list is here. What is the problem? Why should the ABC and SBS not be able to multichannel? Are we protecting the commercial free-to-airs? I am sick of that. It is about time we protected the national broadcasters. We have not seen a lot of that in this chamber, particularly over the last few years. This is not protecting the national broadcasters at all.</para><para>Like Senator Bishop, I have rung representatives of the ABC and the SBS. The answer I got from them was, `Well, it could have been worse.' It could have been worse. A lot of things could have been worse, but they think it could have been better, too. I do not know whom you spoke to, Senator Bishop, but the people I spoke to both said that they would rather have unrestricted multichannelling. I see absolutely no reason why they should not. Senator Bishop tells us that the bill will go back to the House of Representatives, and the House of Representatives might say, `We don't agree with the ABC and SBS multichannelling amendments,' and send it back, and we will just stare you down. I can tell you now that they will not.</para><para>We are going to get up tomorrow, come hell or high water. If the bill is bounced back, it will be bounced back once, and that will be tomorrow. We would have seen who stares whom down, but we will not now. I can guarantee you that there will be so much pressure from the commercial free-to-air broadcasters put on the government to have the bill passed this week so that they have certainty. This is exactly what I have been told by the government, the opposition, the commercial free-to-air broadcasters and everybody. Certainty is the thing that is absolutely necessary right now. That pressure will be huge. What will the government do? Will the government say, `Okay, we'll come back in August and decide on this. We might do one of two things. We might decide that we're going to throw this whole thing out, and we'll go back to the original bill, and then you'll be in real trouble, because the ABC and SBS won't be able to multichannel at all.' </para><para>Besides that, a truck would be able to go through the datacasting rules. Do the government want that? No, I do not think so. Do the free-to-airs want that? No, I do not think so. So I do not think that is going to happen. What else could the government do? They could say, `This is really outrageous. We demand this bill. You go away and think about it and, if we can't have this, we're going to go for a double dissolution on this one.' Great. I would love to go for a double dissolution on this. Let me go for a double dissolution on whether the ABC and SBS should be protected. Let me go for a double dissolution on whether there should be another free-to-air broadcaster. I do not think that is going to happen either.</para><para>I think the easiest thing in the world at this point is to insist on the multichannelling that we actually got yesterday—or it could have been the day before. I keep saying it all melts into one. I think the easiest thing in the world is to insist, and I can guarantee you that what we will end up with, if we do that, is the bill that we have now without this particular amendment. Let me go through a couple of things in this amendment. First of all, there is no national news on the list, except for regional. So ABC and SBS could not do national news, except for regional, on their second channel. Only the ABC, the domestic broadcaster, can do international service—not the SBS. I find that a bit bizarre. Only the SBS, not the ABC, can do local social documentaries. That is a bit bizarre too. Why is it the case? Why are these things happening? Why is this not cast in the negative? </para><para>What is it that you are really scared that the ABC and the SBS will do so well that people will stop watching the commercial free-to-airs in order to watch the ABC and SBS multichannelling doing it? Where is the problem? Tell me what the problem is. This is stifling innovation. I think that is exactly what this argument has been all about all along: stifling innovation. That is what this is doing. </para><para>From what the minister told me in the meeting that we had, the problem, if I recall, was with movies, sport and sitcoms—soapies or something like that. If the minister were being a bit reasonable about this, he would take it away. However, if he were consistent about this, we would be doing with this what happened with the genre rules. We would be saying, `The following are the things we need to protect the commercial free-to-airs or pay TV or whomever we are protecting here. We are not protecting the ABC and the SBS with this one, but we will be protecting somebody.' We would be saying, `Okay, whomever we are protecting, this is what we have to protect them from in the ABC and the SBS. This is what they are scared of. Give me that list of what they are scared of. That is what they should not be able to do, then they can do anything else and then innovation is not stifled.'</para><para>I find this absolutely bizarre. If the list is sport, movies and sitcoms, let us have something up here—which I probably won't vote for anyway—that says, `The ABC and the SBS on their multichannels shall not do sport, movies and sitcoms but, anything else, let them go for it.' Let us have a bit of innovation. Let us show how the ABC can do stuff better than everybody else can—in anything. It is not as though this government is giving the ABC and the SBS $50 million billion gazillion to go out there and show the world how to do things better. And they are still showing the world how to do things better, even with tuppence halfpenny. It is not as though they are being properly resourced, let alone generously resourced. As we have said already in this debate, there is no resourcing from the government for the production of digital television. There is no resourcing for increasing content by the changing over, from analog to digital, of historical documents and footage that the ABC already has; there is zero for that. I would certainly hope it is in the next budget, but I really do not hold out any huge hopes.  </para><para>Why is it so scary, why is it so frightening to allow the ABC and the SBS to multichannel? I do not understand it. I do not understand why we have this; I do not understand why the first time I saw it was at lunchtime; I do not understand why it did not come up when this amendment came up. The more I think about it, the angrier I get. I am not going to be voting for this. I am sick to death of us protecting everybody but the national broadcasters. Everybody in the media business in this country, except the national broadcasters, gets protected. I am really sick of it. It is about time we started protecting the interests of the national broadcasters. I do not understand where this came from; I do not understand why it appeared; and I do not understand why it did not turn up when we were doing the amendments. I absolutely most certainly will not be voting for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>16053</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Kerry Packer could not have written this amendment better himself. This is an appalling backtrack by the Labor Party following a lunchtime huddle with the government. The one saving grace of the procedure in the committee of the whole has been—and I quote Senator Bishop—`that the national broadcasters should have been given multichannelling without restriction'; yet here we are in a late move to cut the ground from under that. When you look at where the ground is being cut with sport, drama and national news, you will see that, as I said, it could not have been written better by the sectional interests which, on the face of it, are being served by this amendment. </para></talk.start><para>It is an appalling derogation of commitment to a principle that the Labor Party was espousing before lunch. I do not know what the Labor Party was given for lunch and I do not know what the government got for lunch either. But it certainly made a manifest difference to the direction this committee is going in after lunch. I am dismayed that just yesterday the Democrats and the Labor Party knocked each other out when it came to datacasting, but here we now have the government and the opposition locking each other in when it comes to pulling the rug from under the national broadcasters and multichannelling. </para><para>Who is going to lose out in this? It is the Australian consumer. It is the people out there who are just beginning to wake up to the opportunities that good handling by their parliament and their representatives of the digital technology would offer. But this parliament—it appears not only this government but also the past government—is still locked into old prescriptions which are going to trammel the opportunities that Australians should have—that is, the opportunities people elsewhere around the world are going to have. </para><para>What will be next? An inquiry followed by a prescriptive bill into the Internet and the opportunities that people might get via the Internet from overseas, which is presumably where the technology and information will come from now that there has been this lock down in Australia. You will remember that I began my contribution to this debate the other day by saying, `Here is an extraordinary situation where the Greens'—usually said, quite wrongly, I believe, to be those who block progress—`are saying let's have freedom in this matter, let's open it up because that is good for consumers.' But the further this has gone, the worse it has got. </para><para>As I said earlier, the best this committee has been able to do, now under influence of both major parties, is to try to restrict the national broadcasters and move the responsibilities, which this parliament should be taking on its own shoulders, across to the ABA. We will have to come back and unscramble this mess. The technology will not go away simply because there is a lock down being applied to it in the interests of the commercial free-to-air broadcasters, the current cabal that has the monopoly on these services. It will not go away. In 1998 there was a missed opportunity. I spoke about it then and I reiterate now: there was not unanimity then, there is not now and there will be less of it in the future. If the Labor Party is looking to come into government next year, it should take a much less prescriptive view of this new technology on behalf of the Australian people and put some distance between itself and the government. The government is censorious and constricted in the view it has to this new technology. The Australian people will be the losers.

The threat that the Labor Party caved in to was, `Oh my goodness, this might go down to the other House and we will find ourselves in a deadlock.' I ask the opposition: has the government only to say on any matter in the future, `Well, the House of Representatives won't stand for this,' and we will cave in up here? You might as well get rid of the Senate. The Senate is here as a house of review and, as I see it, to fix up things when the government gets it wrong and to make things better for the Australian people. That is why they pay our way and that is why they support the Senate. But when the two big parties get together over lunch, the rug gets pulled out from under the Senate as well. So I share Senator Bourne's dismay and anger about this lunchtime cave-in. There must have been some jam puffs dished up, I think. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It is a loss for the Australian viewer down the line. It will have to be fixed up. The parliament will have to go down the tortuous road in the future of fixing up the mistakes made now. We should be opening up this technology to more players, to more outlets and to more opportunities for the viewer instead of constricting it. The one remitting feature was the breakthrough for the national broadcasters. Now they are being straitjacketed as well. It is an appalling decision for the Labor Party to have locked itself into over that lunchtime meeting with the government. Senator Bourne said, `One can question why.' I am not so mystified by all that.

The fact is that, as a result of these amendments, the national broadcasters will actually be allowed to go further than anyone else. They will not be required to provide any original HDTV, unlike the free-to-air broadcasters. They will be allowed to multichannel, which is something that the free-to-air broadcasters will not be allowed to do. This will recognise all the legitimate aspirations of the national broadcasters. It will mean that they will be able to provide all of the services that they would say many times represent the point of distinction between themselves and the commercial networks.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bourne says that we give the ABC tuppence ha'penny. We in fact provide in excess of $2 billion over three years, and for SBS another $300 million-odd. The essential difference between this very extensive list and full multichannelling boils down to sport, sitcoms, soaps, movies, drama and the like, all of which are very much provided in spades by both the free-to-air networks and the pay television industry. It is just worth noting that, when Senator Bourne says we are constraining the national broadcasters and not protecting them, only yesterday we took a decision to protect the pay TV industry from enhancements so that the networks cannot provide same game/same venue. The whole notion of a ban on multichannelling was to allow what was essentially a fledgling pay TV industry to reach take-off point. That position remains, as far as the free-to-air networks are concerned.</para><para>The national broadcasters will be out there able to do a whole range of things that they have not been able to do before and that the free-to-air networks will still not be able to do for some years. So all I can say is: yes, it is not a perfect world, Senator Bourne, but the principle of allowing multichannelling I think was the threshold issue. It is then a matter of what that should involve. If you do allow the national broadcasters to proceed down these innumerable tracks, it seems to me that you are meeting all of the interests they have and allowing them to do all the things that the Australian public would look to the national broadcasters to provide.</para><para>Question put: </para><motion><para>That the amendments (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The Deputy President—Senator S.M.

In addition, any charge determined by the ACA would be disallowable by the parliament. The whole approach adopted is to try to ensure equality of outcome. If competitive neutrality principles mean that the budget of the ABC needs to be increased to enable them to meet that charge, then in one sense you have not affected the status quo. You have still given them an exemption, but you have maintained competitive neutrality. That is always a very desirable principle upon which to operate when you are talking about funding enterprises that have to compete against others who do have to pay charges.

The issues raised as part of the inquiry thus far have proved to be quite difficult and far ranging. It is clear, and it has become clearer as we have proceeded down the path, that it is going to be very difficult to get an outcome that might be in the best interests of consumers. I would like to put on the public record that it was interesting to note that the ACCC, the MTAA and others actually supported the thrust of the bill that was referred to the committee and, as was highlighted by the ACCC, there is a need to proceed down a path towards getting more competition at the retail end of the oil industry. </para><para>I know that the government has sought to introduce Oilcode but has been unable to get agreement at this point in time in regard to that. But the sites act is not carrying out the role that it was designed to do. There is a lot of concern—and a lot of concern has been expressed to the committee with regard to single site franchisees—with regard to multisite franchise operations. At the end of the day, when the committee proceeds to its final report, I hope we are able to see some progress being made insofar as delivering a better outcome for consumers. We will now see the introduction of a new tax system that is going to have an impact on fuel prices. But insofar as the long-term competition aspects of retailing of petrol in this country are concerned, we must see some changes and we must ensure that, at the end of the day, the objectives of Joel Fitzgibbon's bill, the fair prices bill, can actually be realised. As I said, the ACCC did say that the bill certainly had some merit with regard to working towards achieving a more competitive objective. I thank the Senate for allowing me to make those few statements.

This legislation facilitates a government program which, in our home state of Western Australia, will see significant benefits to consumers of telecommunications services. This legislation will facilitate the tendering of a program which, for one of the first times on the globe, will deliver untimed local calls to approximately 80 per cent of Australia's landmass, a program which will see $150 million of the proceeds of the second tranche sale of Telstra invested almost exclusively in remote and regional Australia, a program which will herald one of the most significant boosts to investment in regional and rural Australia in the history of Australia and which has the potential to deliver a significant upgrade to the quality of the services to people in the most remote parts of Australia such as the Murchison district—and, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, you would personally be familiar with that district where you had pastoral properties yourself for many years—the Pilbara, the Kimberley, the Northern Territory, outback Queensland, outback New South Wales and many parts of Victoria and South Australia. </para><para>This legislation facilitates the delivery of a program which will see untimed local calls delivered to something like 38,000 households across 80 per cent of the landmass of Australia. It is one of the most significant telecommunications infrastructure projects anywhere on the globe. This region is, by the very nature of it, one of the most sparsely populated regions on the globe. To deliver the potential increase in service quality and the reduction we expect in the price of that service is, of course, a significant achievement. I thoroughly recommend this bill to the Senate and look forward to the contribution of Senator Allison, who I note has joined us and who is catching her breath and who is about to make yet another eloquent contribution to an important debate in this esteemed chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>16057</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1073">Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> deals with a number of aspects of the provision of the universal service obligation. Specifically, it provides for determination of the universal service cost in advance and provides that the successful tenderer for the provision of untimed local calls in extended zones will become the regional universal service provider. The bill also provides the minister with an unfettered discretion to determine the universal service cost for up to three years in advance.</para></talk.start><para>As a general rule, I must say that the Australian Democrats are wary of ministers being provided with unfettered discretions. In this case, we think that the Australian Communications Authority, as the industry regulator, has the knowledge and expertise to determine the universal service cost. With that in mind, we will be moving an amendment which will require the minister to request the ACA to calculate the universal service cost for the years in relation to which he is proposing to make a determination. The amendment will require that, if the minister determines a figure other than the one arrived at by the ACA, he will be obliged to publish reasons for diverging from the view of the ACA.</para><para>From Senator Bishop's comments before lunch, I understand that the Labor Party will be going one step further and will be moving an amendment to make the determination disallowable. Whilst we do not have any objection to that in principle, we can see serious practical problems with that approach. What would occur if the parliament were to disallow a determination? Would the ACA have to calculate a new figure? Would the minister have to determine a higher figure or a lower figure? A carrier could not be assured of the amount that they would receive for fulfilling the USO until the end of the disallowance period. As we all know, disallowable instruments have legal force until they are disallowed. So you could end up with a situation where a figure is determined and rights accrue to a carrier until the determination is disallowed. The ordinary provisions under the act would then apply, as if no determination had been made. If a further determination was made, different rights would then begin to accrue under that determination. We can see the potential for a substantial degree of uncertainty if a determination were disallowable. Consequently, I foreshadow that we will not be agreeing with the Labor Party's amendment. </para><para>In relation to the $150 million that the government has allocated to the provision of local calls to telephone users in extended zones, the bill will permit the minister to declare that the winner of the tender for the provision of that service is the sole provider of the universal service obligation in those zones. In our minority report to the Senate inquiry into this bill, I raised a number of concerns. The department's advice is that the successful tenderer will be the sole provider of the USO in the extended zones to which the $150 million will relate. The consequence of this is that, if Telstra is not the successful tenderer, that carrier will be in a position to proverbially pack its bags, its personnel and infrastructure, and go back to the city. I am not suggesting that Telstra would dig up its cables, but there would certainly be the possibility that it would remove its personnel from those areas, given that the company would not be obliged to provide services.</para><para>The question that I outlined in the Democrats' minority report and that I reiterate now is: what if the successful tenderer is unable to continue providing services for some reason? As an example, what if that company cannot make money out of the amount that it is receiving by way of universal service cost reimbursement and becomes insolvent? Or what if the technology used, for whatever reason, fails? That scenario may be an unlikely one, but it is one which creates a little nervousness on our part. Whilst Telstra's performance in rural and remote areas has left a lot to be desired in the last couple of years, Telstra is a company well known by all Australians and one which most Australians have confidence in as a financially sound and responsible organisation. I flag that as a concern. The Democrats considered the idea of mandating that Telstra retain a presence in the extended zones, but we can see that the cost of Telstra maintaining a presence—as a type of insurance against the successful tenderer becoming insolvent—is an expensive way of guarding against that contingency.</para><para>Telstra has submitted that requiring it to remain as a universal service provider alongside the successful tenderer in the extended zones would cost in the order of $59 million a year. Even if the magnitude of that figure were debatable, it is still clear that the cost would be substantial and that Telstra would need to be compensated appropriately. That means a further impost on telephone users. We believe that the more appropriate way of dealing with that concern is through a rigorous selection process involving proper examination of the financial standing of the tenderers and ensuring that they propose to use proven technologies. It has been explained to me that it will not be a case of the successful tenderer simply being accepted and the job of providing phones immediately being handed to that carrier. It is more likely that the handover will be a staged process and that the successful tenderer will not become responsible for providing services until installation is complete and it has been shown that a reliable service is in place.</para><para>I want to digress for a moment and consider more generally tendering in relation to telecommunications services. I understand that this bill is not the one which provides for the two contestability pilots and that that legislation will be introduced in the House of Representatives today. But at this point I want to note one of the comments by the Labor senators in their minority report on the inquiry into this billion. They noted: </para><quote><para>The Government has sought to portray competitive tendering of the USO as both the solution to the ills of the decline of services to rural and regional Australia following on from the partial privatisation of Telstra, and as an argument to pursue full privatisation.</para></quote><para>The suggestion that the government is portraying competitive tendering of the USO as the solution to the ills of rural and regional Australia is an assessment that the Australian Democrats are inclined to agree with. It seems to us that the only plan that this government has in place to improve services in rural and remote Australia is tendering for services. We cannot see that tendering is going to result in the delivery of vastly improved services in the non-metropolitan areas. What the government should be doing is taking a more interventionist hand on behalf of rural Australia and looking at the level of the standard telephone service. The Democrats will not stand in the way of the government pursuing competitive tendering, although we doubt its potential benefits, but we would like to see the government implementing other strategies to advance technologies available to rural areas.</para><para>I referred to the level of the standard telephone service. When the Democrats have criticised the proposal to sell the rest of Telstra, the minister has responded that ownership of that carrier is not the best method of regulating telecommunications but that legislation and the appropriate regulatory regime can operate regardless of Telstra's ownership. The problem is that this government appears to be very loath to impose additional regulatory requirements on the carriers. For some time now the Democrats have called for regular legislated reviews of the standard telephone service, which is the service required to be provided under the USO. A regular upgrading of the minimum service required to be provided under the USO would go a long way to ensuring that rural and remote Australia continues to benefit from technology improvements. </para><para>Metropolitan areas receive those new services as a matter of course because it is profitable to offer those services in those areas. But why would a carrier offer a new technology to a remote area if it was not going to be profitable to do so and if it was not obliged to do so by the regulatory regime? It may be that at the end of the review the committee finds that competitive tendering is resulting in the provision of services that are largely comparable to those offered in the cities. If that is the case, then no upgrading of the mandated standard would be necessary. But if rural Australia is falling significantly behind, firstly, the government and the public will have the knowledge that this is the case and, secondly, the government will be in a position to implement an upgrade.</para><para>This government's very soft approach in avoiding regular reviews of the standard telephone service and avoiding the issue of upgrading the standard telephone service are other reasons the Democrats are not prepared to permit the Australian public to lose majority control of Telstra. That majority control may not result in the government exercising direct control over the carrier—or `micromanagement', as the minister refers to it—but at the very least it results in the company being subject to political pressure when it makes decisions which significantly affect the Australian people. The Democrats have circulated an amendment which relates to establishing a committee to review the USO and the customer service guarantee. I foreshadow that I will not be moving that amendment during the passage of this bill. The minister's office has given me a commitment that they will enter into discussions with a view to agreeing on a regular review mechanism for the standard telephone service and customer service guarantee. Should those discussions not result in an outcome satisfactory to the Australian Democrats then we will be in a position to move our amendment during the passage of the bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives today.</para><para>In relation to the tender process, the Australian Democrats would like to see the tenders made public. We believe that would put pressure on the decision makers and the minister to choose the best tender for the right reasons. An amendment has been circulated requiring publication of tender documents subsequent to the award of the tender. We acknowledge concerns about the disclosure of commercially sensitive material, and for that reason we have agreed that instead of moving our amendment we will accept a commitment from the minister that the request for tender will require tenderers to include an executive summary of their proposal which will be made public and, I understand, put online. At a minimum that summary will include a description of the range of services that would be available and the method of service delivery. That will at least allow the public to see which tenderers missed out and what those tenderers were prepared to provide. We believe that it will be in the interests of carriers to fully and publicly explain what they are prepared to offer to the consumer. </para><para>In summary, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing the passage of this bill but we will be moving a number of amendments to attempt to improve a number of aspects of it. I note that we have held a number of discussions with the minister's office, particularly in relation to ensuring that there is no chance that the residents of a tendered area will be worse off in terms of quality of service delivery and availability of services than they presently are. We have received those assurances and will be closely watching the events of the tender process. As a concluding comment, I would like to thank the minister and his office for their assistance and for their cooperation in relation to this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16060</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate, particularly Senator Allison.

We in fact reviewed the standard telephone service, which is the basis of the universal service obligation, in 1996, and subsequently introduced the general digital data capability, which is the ISDN capability, for all those living within five kilometres of a local exchange. The other remaining four per cent have been provided with a special digital data capability—an asymmetric satellite downlink. We first of all introduced the customer service guarantee. There had never been any such thing in this country until we came to office. We have tightened that on a number of occasions. We have not hesitated to take action where we thought it was necessary. We have instituted the Besley inquiry and, to the extent that throws up some constructive suggestions on ways in which we might take the process forward, those matters will be properly considered as well.</para><para>I confirm that we are prepared to have discussions with the Democrats, Senator Allison in particular, about reviews in the context of the next USO bill. I think our general proposition would be that we do not want to have automatic reviews irrespective of performance. It may well be that a model that enables parliament or some other body to, in the first instance, indicate whether a review appears to be desirable could be one way of approaching the matter. We certainly do not want to have everyone exhausted by ongoing review processes. But, as I say, we will discuss the nature and extent of those reviews over the next couple of months. The request for tender will set out the format in which tenderers are to provide their responses, including the need to provide a separate executive summary of the proposal which will be made public after a contract has been signed with the successful tenderer. The request for tender will also give guidance as to what is required to be contained in that executive summary, which would include an outline of the types of services proposed and the means by which they would be delivered.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>16061</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>16061</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrats amendment No. 1 on sheet 1856:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 3 (lines 20 to 23), omit subsection (2A), substitute:</para><para>	(2A)	In deciding whether to make a declaration under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to a person and an area, the Minister is limited to considering factors that are relevant to achieving the objects of this Act.</para></quote><para>This amendment is self explanatory, and I referred to it in my speech in the second reading debate.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>16061</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will oppose schedule 1, item 6. This removes proposed subsections 20(2A) to 20(2D) from the bill. Proposed subsection 20(2B) deems the minister to have made a declaration that a person is a regional universal service provider if an agreement made under sections 56 or 57 of the Telstra Corporation Act is expressed to have effect for the purposes of the subsection. Sections 56 and 57 of the Telstra act allow the Commonwealth to make an agreement with a state or other person granting funds from the untimed local call access reserve. Labor does not believe that a successful tenderer for the $150 million local call zone extension should automatically become the nominated universal service provider for that area. This would mean that the local call zone project goes further than the government's proposed competitive tendering pilot projects so as to reduce Telstra's responsibilities as national USP and exclude the extended zones from those responsibilities.</para></talk.start><para>Labor believes that any prospective universal service tenderers should be selected on the basis of clear, defined, objective criteria expressed through legislation. We want to remove from the bill item 6, which provides that successful local calls zone tenderers automatically become regional universal service providers if their local call agreement so provides. We also want to remove proposed subsection 20(2A), which extends the scope of the framework within which the minister declares universal service providers. The proposed subsection provides that the minister is not limited to considering only the person's suitability to provide the services that must be provided to fulfil the universal service obligations. This, the opposition believes, is overly broad and provides inadequate guidance as to what matters would be considered important in determining who provides the universal service for a given area.

We see no reason why there is a need for Telstra to remain in the area. I think it is quite clear, however, that Telstra will remain in some parts of this USO area. They will continue to be competitive in that region, and nobody would suggest otherwise. But to require Telstra to stay there and provide the service is unrealistic and obviously would be extremely expensive.

The opposition amendment provides that, where a former provider considers a request unreasonable, the matter may be referred to the ACA for resolution.

The effect is to reduce the scope of information which current digital data service providers may obtain from former providers. The thrust of our amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 is to limit the information that prospectively incoming USPs might request from outgoing USPs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>16066</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government prefer the Democrat approach to this matter.

This subsection proposes that the ministerial determinations relating to the calculation in advance of the cost of providing the universal service obligation must not be made unless the minister has received advice on the matter from the Australian Communications Authority. This amendment gives effect to Labor's belief that the ACA has an important role in calculating the cost of the USO. It is appropriate that the minister's determination of the universal service cost is based on advice from the ACA and should not be made prior to, or without receiving, such advice. The scope of the minister's discretion to make determinations relating to the universal service cost up to three years in advance pursuant to item 70 of the bill should be restrained, the opposition believes, by rendering the minister's determination a disallowable instrument. This is the effect of opposition amendment No. 11, and that is the critical part in the bill which distinguishes our amendments from the Democrats amendments Nos 9 to 11 that have just passed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>16067</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate, we will not be supporting these amendments.

The Democrats considered two options: the first was simply to omit the unrelated clients test and require satisfaction of either the employment test or the business premises test; and the second was the one that we have chosen—namely, requiring satisfaction of at least two of the three tests. As I also mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, we are very disappointed that the government has chosen a completely different approach from that which was recommended by the Ralph report. We appreciate that the government is trying to simplify the personal services business test by testing whether the individual conducts themselves like a business rather than considering whether they conduct themselves in an employee like manner. However, in pursuing that goal of simplification, the result is presently a regime that will present almost no obstacle to any person who is serious about trying to alienate their income through an interposed entity. Whilst we would have preferred a rewriting of this bill in accordance with that which was contemplated in the Ralph report, we are not in a position to insist on that and we accept the political realities of attempting to do that. Consequently, we are by these requests attempting to tighten the arrangements that have been presented to us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>16070</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will not be supporting the Democrat requests Nos 1 and 2.

Many contractors who gain less than 80 per cent of income from one source would fail the personal services business test and therefore be subject to the measure.

That will save me having to go back over each one and repeat the story. The Democrat amendments that are before us now are in the form of requests and are requests Nos 1 and 2 of the schedule that has been circularised. The view of the opposition is that we regard these as important tests in order to filter out the difference between those who are genuinely contractors and those who ought to be properly regarded as not contractors and treated for tax purposes as employees. This is quite a critical part of this piece of legislation. </para></talk.start><para>The difficulty I have—this applies not only to Democrats requests Nos 1 and 2 but also to Nos 3 and 4—is with the filtering mechanism of these tests. If you twin them you make them not filters—if you meet any of the criteria, your tax status is determined—but if you combine a couple of the criteria then from the opposition's viewpoint you make the tests too stiff and you catch people who might genuinely be real contractors. It is not our intention to do that. We recognise and value the importance of genuine contractors, and that needs to be clear, but we support the intention of this legislation to filter out those who should properly be regarded as other than true contractors. Because the Democrats requests would lift the bar and catch, in our view, genuine contractors, we will not support these requests. </para><para>Requests not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16071</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move government requests Nos 1 and 2 on sheet EF214: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 24 (line 20), after "entities", insert "(other than *associates of the individual that are not individuals)".</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 24 (lines 27 to 30), omit paragraph (2)(a), substitute:</para><para>	(a)	the entity engages one or more other entities to perform work, other than:</para><para>	(i)	individuals whose *personal services income is included in the entity's *ordinary income or *statutory income; or</para><para>	(ii)	*associates of the entity that are not individuals; and</para></quote><para>I table the document which explains the requests in detail.

These requests will close a potential loophole in the employment test which is one of the tests to determine whether an individual or entity conducts a personal services business and, therefore, is outside the alienation measure. Request No. 1 is really a technical amendment which rectifies an incorrect cross-reference contained in a note to section 84-1. Request No. 2 deals with section 86-80 which currently refers to a person receiving an amount in salary or wages as `you'. This is to be changed to `the individual', in line with other sections in subdivision 86-B. The reference to `the individual' will mean the individual gaining or producing the assessable income. My initial thoughts have been confirmed by advisers. These are, as I have said, very technical requests. I urge the Senate to pass them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>16071</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I indicated at the beginning of the committee stage of this legislation, I was taken somewhat by surprise by the government requests.

Essentially it seeks to completely revamp the basis on which the commissioner issues a personal service business determination. I think we all understand that, under the present arrangements, the commissioner can issue a determination if the individual could reasonably expect to meet the employment test or the business premises test or, for some unusual circumstances, could meet one of the three tests. As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, when a business is deriving 80 per cent or more of its personal services income from one source, there is a presumption that the income is rightly income of the individual rather than the interposed entity.</para></talk.start><para>With that particular issue in mind, we would have thought that the criteria of which the commissioner would need to be satisfied would be more stringent than if the business was not deriving 80 per cent or more of its personal service income from one source. Instead, it seems that the criteria are less stringent because it is satisfactory to show a reasonable expectation and unusual circumstances. It leaves open, I believe, that there is a further basis on which the commissioner can make a determination, which becomes known as the fourth test, during the committee inquiry. That test is satisfied if it can be shown that the income is for producing a result and the individual is required to supply tools of trade and is liable for rectifying defective work.</para><para>The Democrats have always believed that the fourth test is a reasonable test. Senators will note that it forms the basis of our amendment in that we have also given the commissioner a power to refuse to issue a determination if, having regard to common law principles, he or she is of the view that the work is being undertaken in an employee-like manner. So we believe that this is a far more rigorous test than that which is currently in the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>16073</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This request is technically flawed. Therefore, on those grounds alone, it should not be proceeded with. But let me say that we will be opposing it. It would replace the government's criteria of the test requiring the contractor to satisfy either the employment test or the business premises test and the further grounds: income for producing a result, supplying the equipment or tools of trade and being liable for the cost of rectifying defects. In addition, the commissioner could refuse to issue a determination if he considers, having regard to the common law principles, that the work is done in an employee-like manner. </para></talk.start><para>Most contractors who get 80 per cent or more of their income from one source would not satisfy the criteria proposed by the Democrat request. Further, the commissioner could effectively reconsider the whole matter of whether an individual is conducting a personal services business, without having regard to any criteria laid down in the bill. The request also excludes the unusual circumstances criterion in the bill which allows a contractor to obtain a personal services business determination if, but for those circumstances, they would have met one of the tests for a personal services business. The test was important to allow contractors who normally contract with the public at large but who take a long-term one-off contract to be considered as conducting a personal services business.</para><para>The Democrats' request going to the grounds for a personal services business determination has been proposed only for individuals seeking determinations. No request has been proposed for a personal services business determination for entities. The government assumes that this is a drafting oversight and, if not fixed, could lead to a vastly different treatment than when income is received by an entity. So we oppose the request which has been moved by the Australian Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>16074</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have just heard the explanation by the government as to why it is opposing this. I think the explanation can be divided into two parts, the first part being what the government regards as the technical imperfection and difficulty thus created by that, and the second being the argument on merit as to why the government opposes it—that is, it is an argument categorised as a merit argument. As to the first part of thatobjection, it is my understanding of the procedure that, if the chamber clearly expresses a view in favour of a request which might create some technical drafting prob-lems, then it is for the government to bring back the correct drafting—and we tick it off—not for it to defeat an intention of the chamber by resorting to arguments about technicality. If that is a correct summary, the first part of the government's argument therefore is not substantial and should be put aside. On the second part of the government's argument, which would be under the heading of `the merit of the case', I expressed a view earlier. Senator Ridgeway gave a fuller view than I did.

The Treasurer, Mr Costello, said earlier this year that we would never have to consider any more amendments. This bill comes no closer to helping people living in caravans, mobile homes and boarding houses. Indeed, many of the people in these circumstances will still be going backwards and have every right to feel discouraged.

This measure before the Senate proves that the government only ever gives back a fraction of what it takes away. The government, having been found out to be punishing the most vulnerable renters in the community, to save face with its Democrat partners, comes into the Senate offering some site fee payers a miserable, paltry, 16c a day. It is now clear that over half the residents will not get a cent. As if ever such a paltry amount could wipe away the stain or the discrimination of applying a GST to the site fees of some 160,000 low income Australians.</para><para>We all recall in recent weeks the public humiliation of the National Party by the Prime Minister. Suddenly we had the Democrats breathing fire and brimstone. They said they were not going to take it any more and they were going to tell the government what to do; but not the National Party. Note: not the National Party. There had not been a peep from the Democrats on this matter until approximately 2½ half weeks ago, despite Labor's pursuit of this issue over the last 18 months, and particularly that of my colleague Mr Swan in the other place. The original GST deal which the Democrats entered into with the Liberal-National Party, we should remember, allowed the discrimination against caravan park, mobile home and boarding house renters to happen in the first place. Why did they suddenly have a change of heart? Because the arrangement that they had entered into with the government of `what you don't know won't hurt you' was shattered when Laurie Oakes spilled the real Econtech figures on the news two weeks ago. Only a Liberal-National Party government with a senior minister such as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, could describe people living in these circumstances as `tourists'; only he could be so arrogant and out of touch on this issue. Unfortunately, this legislation represents all too well the rich doing well and getting very substantial tax cuts and the poor in our community getting the GST. What is especially concerning about this whole fiasco is that the seriousness of this issue seems to be completely lost on many members of the Liberal-National Party government. </para><para>The fact is rising rates will cause considerable hardship in our community. Rents are a major item; for many average households rent makes up 30 per cent of the weekly budget. As a result, even small increases in rent have a big impact on households. These increases also have a profound effect on the adequacy of the GST compensation. We should not forget that the current compensation package was designed by the government to compensate for an average 1.9 per cent GST price effect, a price effect that we now know to be a lie. At the last election the Liberal-National Party promised rents would increase by no more than 2.3 per cent at the most. In fact, they argued that the real impact would be 0.7 per cent. But let us put that figure aside for one moment. Only after the leaking of the government's Econtech report did we discover the grand scale of the government's misleading of the Australian community.</para><para>This independent report, commissioned by the government, was kept hidden for six months, and it revealed rent increases double that which the government promised: in the case of boarding house rents, up 4.4 per cent in the short term; and in the case of general rents, up 4.7 per cent in the long term. I think it is fair to assume, though, that these are optimistic figures from the government's leading modeller. In the case of boarding house rents, it assumes that the 5.5 per cent GST will only lead to an increase of 4.4 per cent. This is a very optimistic assessment—as we have seen with so many other features of the GST, particularly in recent weeks. Regardless of cost savings, of which there will be very few in this sector, consider this simple fact: to produce a net four per cent increase it assumes boarding house operators will reduce their weekly rent, starting this Saturday, before applying the concessional five per cent GST. I would like the National-Liberal Party to produce one example of a reduction in boarding house rents. Indeed, we have evidence that most actually are increasing their rents the full five per cent.</para><para>I will discuss the Econtech modelling in a little more detail a little later. I would like to talk more about the significance of the rent increases admitted to. We have already had the Treasurer confirm on ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program—and this was a fairly rambling interview, I have to say, and I am sure Senator Lees, as Leader of the Australian Democrats, read it—that there would be an $8 to $10 increase in an average $200 per week rent, an increase of four to five per cent. He said that this was affordable. But let us consider this: for a dual income family on $45,000 with two kids this rent increase will automatically wipe out almost half of the $25 a week tax cut and increase in family assistance. This leaves the family just $15 to pay for the GST on the rest of their spending, a grand total of $3.75 for each family member. This hardly sounds affordable and leaves their long overdue tax cut in tatters.</para><para>I did refer to that interview earlier by the Treasurer. It really was a ramble. One of the interesting aspects of it was he blamed Senator Lees for the problem with rents. He blamed the Democrats, because allegedly they were the ones who, when they did the deal over the GST, were responsible for the deferral of some of the taxes in relation to the commercial sector. The Treasurer falsely blamed this deferral as a cause of the significant increase in rents. Fair weather partners, Senator Lees—they will give you the credit when it suits them, and they will blame you when it suits them.</para><para>But let us go back to another family living in Sydney, where the rents are up to $350 per week for an average house. In this case the family would be paying up to $17 per week more, leaving just $7 per week to pay for the GST on the rest of their spending, a grand total of $1.75 per person per week. NATSEM, another economic model, estimates the GST price impact on a family of this type at around $20 per week. It does not take a genius to work out that this family will a big loser. </para><para>Let us go to the events of the last two weeks, when the Treasurer announced a patch-up with the Australian Democrats. The whole problem was to magically go away with the bill that we are considering here in the Senate this evening. This bill gives effect to a 10 per cent increase in the maximum rate of rent assistance, rather than the previous seven per cent pledge. The Democrats herald this as a major victory, as did the Nationals—that is, after the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the cabinet squashed the National Party on this issue. The Nationals had nothing to do with this legislation at all.</para><para>Perhaps the first point to make is that working people who will experience rent increases with the GST get nothing from this, since they are unlikely to get rent assistance. Around 5.5 million Australians rent, but only 20 per cent of those get rent assistance. So it does not solve the problem of vanishing tax cuts or compensation. Secondly, it will not even benefit everyone on rent assistance. Approximately one-third of the one million Australians who receive rent assistance get less than the maximum rate. This bill does not give these people one extra cent, because it is only the maximum rate that is being lifted. This is important, because many people in caravan parks and mobile homes parks fall into this category.</para><para>It is possible that over half the people in these parks will not get a cent. Their site fees are not sufficient for them to receive the maximum of rent assistance. Consider this—to receive the maximum rate of rent assistance, and thus get some benefit from these measures, residents would have to pay the following weekly site fees: a single person $88, a couple $108.50. Those who have actually been to these places would know that the site fees range in price from around $75 per week to $125 per week. For single people, only those paying mid-range sites fees or more would benefit. For couples, only those paying site fees near the upper end will benefit at all from this measures. So it does not even make a decent fist of assisting the people who started this whole debate. The final point to make about the deal is that even for those who do benefit the effect is marginal. Let us take a single pensioner. For those who are entitled to the maximum rate the 10 per cent increase enacted by this bill is worth a paltry 16c per day extra compared to the previous seven per cent increase.</para><para>Let us have a look at Econtech. Labor have been pushing for some time to see this report. On 16 February of this year my colleague Mr Swan in the other place asked the Treasurer to produce the modelling that he and the Democrats had agreed on to determine whether those being forced to pay an up-front GST on their rents would be worse off. He refused. He claimed he had not seen such a report. On 8 March in the Senate my colleague Senator Denman again called for the release of the government's modelling. Senator Newman replied:</para><quote><para>I have said several times now that a report was being prepared, and I have also said that I have not seen the report. I am now going to tell the Senate the rest of the answer, which is that it has been passed to the Treasurer, for whom it was commissioned. It will be up to the Treasurer to look at it, study it and discuss matters, if he chooses, with the Democrats—and I imagine if that was his commitment he will be doing so.</para></quote><para>So, despite Labor's attempts at jogging both the government's and the Democrats' memories, no-one appeared to know anything about how the GST was going to impact on caravan park, mobile home and boarding house residents. Yet this never once stopped them making the claim that these Australians would not be worse off from 1 July. In Senate estimates hearings on 24 May staff of the Department of Family and Community Services and Senator Newman were asked where the modelling was. Yet again the buck was passed. The Department of Family and Community Services claimed the matter was one for Treasury. In Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearings on 2 June I asked the Assistant Treasurer and officials present to produce the Econtech report. There was a bit of paper shuffling, officials going in and out to ask. They approached the Treasurer's office, and he refused to release it—no backbone from the Nationals, no comment from the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees, and no admission from the government that caravan park, mobile home and boarding house renters would be worse off because of the discriminatory policy that sees them charged 5.5 per cent on their rent and sites fees. </para><para>The truth is that this government—the Liberal-National parties—has known for some considerable time that these people were going to be worse off under the GST. In an answer to a written question on notice from the latest budget estimates hearings of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee it has admitted that a draft final report was provided by Econtech to the department on 8 December 1999—question No. 47. These answers also indicate that the Minister for Family and Community Services had seen the report—question No. 46—and forwarded the final Econtech report to the Treasurer on 5 April this year, question No. 51.</para><para>This conflicts with the minister's buck-pass on 8 March when she claimed that this was already with the Treasurer. When details of the report were leaked the contradictions continued. Laurie Oakes announced that the report said that the rents of boarding house residents would go up by 4.4 per cent in the short term as a result of an up-front GST but by only 3.7 per cent if they were input taxed. Later the same day, the Treasurer, who by now had admitted to having the Econtech report, said that the figures were now four per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively. The government also claimed that boarding house renters would be better off paying GST on their rents in the long term. Mr Costello also claimed:</para><quote><para>The long-term savings may flow through sooner than assumed by Econtech. A new entrant to the boarding house market or an existing supplier providing services with new buildings or furnishings after tax reform would be able to operate at a lower cost. This competitive pressure would lower all rents.</para></quote><para>This sounds exactly like the petrol saga we are going through at the moment. It is obvious from this statement that Mr Costello is completely unfamiliar with the boarding house sector, which has been in decline for the last decade. In fact a day after Mr Costello was hoping for growth, the private group providing some 80 per cent of the boarding house accommodation in Sydney's inner west, In-West Holdings Pty Ltd, announced that it was withdrawing from the provision of boarding house accommodation. The continued closure of boarding houses across the country is the reason why rents will never drop to long-term levels. They are closing in the face of an increasing number of homeless in the Australian community. This means the central issue, when it comes to the impact of the GST on boarding house rents, is whether you believe that the government has been hiding the report for the last six months. The Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, did not believe the government Monday week ago when she said:</para><quote><para>In the short term figures are the issue here and they are not good. The long term figures, on the other hand, are based on more heroic assumptions about refurbishment. We know that many boarding houses occupied by the poorest people in our society haven't been painted, let alone refurbished, since World War Two.</para></quote><para>Despite this evidence, the Democrats, desperate for a deal, have been duped into accepting the measure that we have before us this evening—that is, rent assistance compensation for only some of the people who will be affected by this dreadfully discriminatory tax, the GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>16080</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Having listened to Senator Sherry, it is probably a waste of time to go through all the inaccuracies in what he had to say, but I do want to make a couple of corrections and put a few things on the record. When we discussed the new tax package with the government originally our concern was, and indeed remains, those on the lowest incomes. That is why we insisted that basic food be taken out and also, in terms of rents, that a number of measures be put in that original package to partly quarantine the rent of those in public housing to make sure that the four per cent increase in pensions and benefits could not be touched for rent. There was also the $45 million that went into SAP, as well as that original $33 million increase in rent assistance. </para></talk.start><para>It is correct that our option for paying to take food out, paying for the food changes in the GST package, was not to leave in place some of those state taxes, but that was eventually part of the compromise. Yes, we were well aware that that had an impact—a small impact but nevertheless an impact—on rents. That is why we insisted on the original increase of $33 million—an increase from four per cent to seven per cent. I am very pleased to see that this bill tonight puts in place our second increase, with the negotiation now up to 10 per cent. Looking at some of the other needs in this sector, I think one point the Labor Party likes to continually skip over is the fact that landlords have a choice. One of the problems is that it seems that, either through lack of information or simply an intent to make as much money as possible for themselves, some of them are simply choosing the option of 5.5 per cent instead of looking at the other alternative, particularly in the boarding houses that I mentioned—some of those, unfortunately, that I have seen in Adelaide, for example, where there has been very little, if any, maintenance done for I don't know how long. Obviously the better option for them is not the 5.5 per cent but simply to choose for their rents to be zero rated as all other rents are.</para><para>If Senator Sherry wants to look through the boarding house report that has been done by Econtech, he will see in the back of it where the various types of boarding houses have been modelled in different ways. For those boarding houses where there is very little, if any, refurbishment the obvious choice is to simply treat those places as all other rental accommodation is treated. But those caravan parks and those places that do spend some money and look after their residents are going to see that the better option is 5.5 per cent. As part of our negotiations with government, all operators of caravan parks, boarding houses and hostels will have this drawn to their attention very clearly. Indeed there will be a report back to this place advising us of what the impact has been and what is actually happening out there after the GST is put in place.</para><para>Rent assistance has been an important supplement for those people on very low incomes. If you go through the history books, it goes back to 1956. It originally started just for those who were entirely dependent on pensions. The means test was introduced in 1965, and from 1985 it became known as rent assistance. So this is something that in the past the Labor Party has been quite happy to be associated with. Indeed, in 1991 it was indexed—it was twice yearly indexation—and major changes were made in 1993 which recognised the structure of family types. So it is all very well for the Labor Party to now find a major problem with rent assistance, but it has been a measure put in place and indeed supported by government after government. I look forward to the passage of this bill and to the increasing of rent assistance by the full 10 per cent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16081</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—I will be brief. I thank honourable senators for their contributions. I share Senator Lees' view that one could probably devote the entire time allowed for the second reading debate in this place to rebutting the many misleading concepts made by Labor spokesmen on this matter. Suffice it to say that Labor and caravans have a long history. They increased the wholesale sales tax on caravans by 10 per cent straight after the 1993 election and did not compensate anybody. They increased the hidden wholesale sales taxes on a whole range of hardware and other products, and input taxes to rental accommodation after 1993 and did not compensate anybody. They increased a whole range of wholesale sales taxes which applied to a whole range of necessities of life in the supermarket in 1993—items such as toilet paper and toothpaste—by over 10 per cent. They did not compensate low income earners who need things like toilet paper and toothpaste every day.</para></talk.start><para>They go around Australia scaring people—scaring old people, scaring pensioners, scaring people in caravan parks. The great thing that will occur in 36 hours time is that all of the people such as Wayne Swan in the other place will not have that scaremongering game to play anymore. They will actually have to do something different; they will have to do some serious policy work. They will have to start telling the Australian people what they mean by the words `roll-back'. They will have to try to convince the Australian people how they intend rolling back some taxes without rolling forward others. The Australian people will demand to know, if you roll back a tax, which one you will roll forward because the people of Australia know that there is no such thing as a magic apple, there is no such thing as a tree with money on it and there is no such thing as fairies at the bottom of the garden. Very sad but very true.  </para><para>When you seek to spend lots of money and not raise taxes, you end up doing what Labor did year after year, that is, run up tens of billions of dollars worth of debt year after year. We all know that that puts pressure on interest rates, so the mums and dads of Australia, who either pay rents or mortgages or pay off their Bankcards, have to pay back at much higher rates. We remember that, when Labor borrowed and borrowed and spent in their 13 years in office, interest rates on typical home mortgages topped 17 per cent. In some cases, businesses were paying in excess of 30 per cent interest on their business loans. Labor wanted us to believe that you could keep spending and not have to balance the budget.</para><para>So, Senator Lees, shortly after 1 July we will need to hear what Labor intends to do in terms of which taxes they are going to roll forward, and we will be able to make true assessments. We will not have to go to Econtech, we will not have to worry about PRISMOD and those sorts of people. We will not have to have these arcane and boring fights about which model is right or wrong. The people of Australia will be able to go into the supermarkets, into the bottle shops and to the petrol stations. Indeed, the people who live in caravan parks have had to put up with these city slicker, glimmer twin type politicians going around trying to scare the daylights out of them. A few months ago was the first time Wayne Swan had been to a caravan park. I have it on good authority that he had never visited a caravan park in his life before. When Mr Swan turned up in his nicely trimmed Italian suit, the people in caravan parks were quite shocked; they thought he was a health inspector or something. </para><para>I have had reports from caravan parks around southern Queensland and northern New South Wales of people being shocked and scared by seeing this guy who looked like a tax inspector, a health inspector or a member of the Federal Police turning up and trying to scare them about what will happen to their rents. Wayne Swan is going to have to find a new game to play. The people in caravan parks will know that the new tax system will be very good for them; it will be very good for all Australians. The great thing is that the Labor Party are going to have to find a new game to play. After four years of carping, whingeing, whining and negativity they will have to get down and do some hard work if they are going to be taken seriously.

I do not know whether my colleague Mr Swan had been to caravan parks before; I will pass on the accusation. Senator Campbell asserts it as fact. Mr Swan can defend himself. I do know he has done a very effective job on this matter, and I do know he does not wear Italian suits, Senator Campbell. The only tax inspectors that people in Australia will have to fear after Saturday are those thousands of extra GST tax inspectors who will be roaming the country harassing small business.</para></talk.start><para>A question: why isn't Senator Newman here to deal with this legislation? Well, this will obviously be my last comment. The parliamentary secretary will not tell us why Senator Newman is not here this evening. It is important to make the point that Senator Newman should be here. This whole measure is an embarrassing backdown for the government. More importantly, I alluded to a number of questions that were put on notice, and the conflicting statements by the minister, Senator Newman, on this matter and the cover-up that she participated in with that economic model. The cover-up that the minister participated in—an appalling situation—and she is not here to answer a couple of questions about the conflicting statements she made in that regard. </para><para>This is the end of a sorry saga with respect to the performance of this minister and the Treasurer on this matter and the way they covered up the report for six months, but the most sorry part about all of this is the effect on the low income people in particular in Australia who are going to be paying double the rents that they were told by this government prior to the last election they would be paying. As a result of this increase in rents and other factors, many of them will be worse off under the GST.</para><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>16083</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16083</page.no><id.no>R1036</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16083</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>16083</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1036">A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> almost 28 hours before the GST is introduced into Australia.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—On the east coast.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—On the east coast.

One of the big advantages of being a Western Australian is that we do not get the GST until two hours later.

As we get closer to the dawning of the GST, and on the last scheduled sitting day of the Senate before the winter recess, we still find before us legislation from the government amending its own tax—and this is before the tax itself is implemented. We have now had over 2,000 amendments to the GST legislation. It is as if the government wants to try to confuse the Australian community deliberately. But the fundamental thing about these amendments that just keep on coming—and doubtless they will continue after the introduction of the tax—is that they change the rules. The big defence that the community has is that, if the government does not know what the tax law is supposed to be, how can taxpayers know what their legal obligations under the tax law are? As I have said, there have been over 2,000 amendments, and this legislation adds to them again this evening. We also have a couple of other bills to come on later tonight which will add even more to the number. If the government does not know what the tax law is supposed to be and if, at this late hour, with only hours to go before the new tax, we are still legislating change, how can the Australian Taxation Office, the body independent from the government but with the statutory obligation of administering the law, know what the law is in order to administer it properly?  </para><para>That is not the end of the problem. The other difficulty of the Australian Taxation Office is that it is understaffed and, when taxpayers question it about their legal liability, it cannot advise them because the government keeps changing the ground rules. As the tax gathering authority, the ATO also cannot advise people because it has insufficient staff to deal with the technical complexity of formal advice as to what the meaning of the law is. Companies and individuals seeking tax rulings from the Australian Taxation Office find that there is a huge list and that they are well back in the queue. With hours to go until the new tax, we still do not know what the legal obligations are.</para><para>On Saturday, when this new tax comes into force, most Australians will be given a sharp jolt, a sharp reminder of what this tax is. As Australians wander off to their Saturday afternoon recreation and go to the Australian football, to the rugby league or to the races, as they go through the turnstiles there will be a new tax of 10 per cent that they did not pay last week but they will pay this week. As people go into the ground to buy the football budget or racing guide to see which players are in which teams or what horses are running, there will be a new cost on the guide of 10 per cent. They did not pay it last week, but they will pay it this week.</para><para>As they wander down to the stall to get a hot pie served to them during the interval of the races or of the football, there will be another new tax—10 per cent on the pie. And so it will go. If their kids want to wander over to the stall selling memorabilia for the sporting teams to buy a club jersey, a scarf or a beanie, what will they find? A new 10 per cent tax. They did not pay it last week, but they will pay it this week. This Saturday afternoon will be the time at which the real meaning of the GST dawns on Australians, as they recreate and enjoy their Saturday afternoon of leisure. They will be en masse confronted by a new tax for the first time.</para><para>The government, which luxuriates in the belief—emphasised tonight by the Prime Minister's demanding time to address the nation—that this tax will be good for you, will find that Australians on the first sampling will reject the package in even stronger terms than before. Australians know this Prime Minister said that there would never ever be such a tax and then went back on his word. He said that petrol prices would not rise, and we know they will. He told us that beer would be at a lower price than it will be across the bar now—in fact, it will be some 8c to 9c more expensive. The Prime Minister's record of deceit and dishonesty on this is now legendary.</para><para>What about the most famous commitment by the government concerning this tax—that the percentage of the tax will not rise? Australians are not dumb. One of the great things about Australians is that they see through cynicism and they see through propaganda. Any Australian knows that, in every country of the world in which a GST has been introduced, after its introduction the level of the tax has gone up. So, when the government says that it will not increase it to more than 10 per cent—and this is coming from a government that said that it would never ever introduce it in the first place—there is a massive horse laugh of disbelief as ordinary Australians once again say, `The government has it wrong.'</para><para>Before I turn to the legislation before us, I should remark on what I have just seen on television. The Prime Minister demanded access to the airwaves tonight to address the nation on the tax package. This is after the government has spent $430 million of taxpayers' money trying to publicise the tax in a party political way. As if that were not good enough, as if the government had not unchained the taxpayers' pockets and dipped into them to pay for the government's own blatant political propaganda, the Prime Minister went on the airwaves tonight to emphasise the message. If you listened to and watched what the Prime Minister said, apart from the dreary, boring monotone in which he addressed in an expressionless way the Australian community about such vital—using his term—tax reform, what did he say? He said all sorts of things which relate to an election campaign and very few which relate to the tax. He did not explain or sell the tax in any great detail. He used the air time for a party political propaganda broadcast. That is what tonight was about. </para><para>He started citing the government's economic record. One would ask what that has to do with the tax of the present. He went on and eulogised his own so-called prowess at economic management, but what does that have to do with the tax? Why should taxpayers pay for the government to tell them what it thinks its record is like when they are supposed to be being briefed on the tax? This was a blatant exercise in politics, and the sad thing is that this government has dragged down the level of public debate by abusing the powers of its office and using the resources of the tax office to fund party political propaganda. At least the brewers of Australia, who are running an ad with the slogan `It's your shout', attacking the government for the misrepresentation of our beer prices—and who are, in turn, being attacked by the government—can say that they are paying for the ad themselves. What can the government say? The taxpayers are paying for it.</para><para>If Labor keeps making poll points ahead of the government, the government will turn around and get more taxpayers' money to sell the message even more strongly. This is a disgrace to the national political scene, and it is the beginning of an insidious new approach of the government abusing its responsibilities to taxpayers and using their funds for party political propaganda. Tonight, we got all the old platitudes as if nothing had changed, as if it were not true that rents are going up, as if it were not true that petrol prices will be higher, as if it were not true that beer prices will be higher, as if it were not true that the government had promised that no business would go out of business because of the GST and as if it were not true that the government had promised that no-one would be worse off, when already many Australians are worse off and many more stand to be worse off.</para><para>The fundamental objection we have to this tax is that it is unfair. It hurts those in the most exposed and defenceless positions in our society the most. This is a percentage tax on almost everything, and the so-called compensation for it is in a tax cut which comes in gross dollar terms. Percentages go up with inflation. The value of a gross cut in taxation remains the same and, as time ticks by and as inflation kicks in, the value of the compensation erodes dramatically. Those that get the least compensation are hurt the worst, and they are the ones at the bottom of the scale. That is our fundamental objection to this tax, and we should never shrink from citing it as often as possible.</para><para>Let me turn to the provisions of the <inline ref="R1036">A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>. The bill covers three broad areas of tax law: first, the rationalisation of administrative penalties across different taxes; second, the rules governing who can advise, prepare and lodge business activity statements on behalf of taxpayers; and, third, in a broad category, a plethora of miscellaneous amendments in areas including the new pay as you go or PAYG system, rounding down of tax debts, discretions concerning lodgment of the business activity statements and the imposition of general interest charged on outstanding debts. Broadly, that is what this bill encompasses. As I say, with only hours to go to the GST there are yet further amendments. </para><para>I will just address for a moment the rationalisation of administrative penalties across different taxes. This bill proposes to amend the various pieces of tax legislation to introduce a uniform administrative penalty regime that will impose penalties relating to statements and schemes, penalties for the late lodgment of returns and other documents, and penalties for failing to meet other tax obligations. As a matter of principle, it has to be said that Labor support the objective of a consistent regime across taxes for similar behaviour. The penalty should be the same for similar offences—a principle to which we adhere. However, whether or not the particular penalties proposed by the bill are struck at an appropriate level of penalty for the various categories of offence and for the differing circumstances is a very difficult judgment to make. For that reason, we sought to have an inquiry into the legislation.   </para><para>The government's behaviour, in rushing this bill into the House of Representatives with very short notice, did not enable those in that chamber to consult sufficiently well enough with all of the stakeholders affected by these legislative changes. As a consequence—in the Senate, the house of review—it requires us to exercise great caution and discipline in examining whether these changes meet the level of consistency that we adhere to in principle. It is very difficult to say in the circumstances, and the conclusion is still an open one. However, the position of the Labor Party is that we will support this legislation. </para><para>We will support it because the government wants to make these changes to the tax law. When Australians reject the GST, never let it be said that this is not the GST that the government wanted; this is the GST the government wanted. By giving approval to these legislative changes, the government will not be able to escape the fact that this is its tax law as it desired it. Of course, when the wheels start to come off the trolley, the government will point the finger, as it has done over recent weeks, to the corner of the Senate chamber where the Democrats sit and blame them for forcing the government to make the changes that have already occurred in the tax act. It was a voluntary decision of the government to accept the Democrat changes and, by voluntarily accepting them, the government has to wear the pain of the complications that those changes bring. They boasted about it tonight as if it were originally the intention to exempt food and do a number of other things. They boasted about it tonight in this deliberately boring monotone of an address by the Prime Minister. Because they boast about it, they certainly have to cop the responsibility for it. Because we believe that the technical changes sought by the government should be supported so the government cannot blame Labor about this tax, and because these technical changes do go to the principle to some extent, we will therefore support them. I now indicate that.</para><para>I will not go to a greater consideration of the other parts of the legislation, other than to remark on the changes to the business activity statements. The business activity statements are the basis on which taxpayers in business interact with the tax office. It is effectively a summary of taxation liability that is to be provided regularly by the taxpayer, either monthly or quarterly—in general, quarterly for most small businesses. This then raises the issue about who will be able to advise, prepare and lodge business activity statements for taxpayers. This is precisely the same issue of who is allowed to lodge income tax returns now. Currently, this is restricted to tax agents and lawyers. This bill proposes to allow members of accounting bodies, tax practitioners and the bookkeepers working for them and persons that provide payroll services to be involved in business activity statement advice, preparation and lodgment. This is a broadening to some extent and it appears to have—at least in principle—the backing of a number of accountancy firms and the Taxation Institute. The need for broadening arises because there are not enough tax agents in Australia to deal with the reporting requirements of the government's so-called simplified tax system. As a consequence, we will support those amendments as well. </para><para>In conclusion, here we are again, only hours from the new tax system being introduced, adding additional administrative complexity. It is not a defence for taxpayers to say they did not know what the law is, but on this occasion the government just keeps changing the goalposts. How can the tax office be aware of all of the changes and advise those that seek private rulings? It is disgraceful that the government should have so botched the introduction of its so-called monumental changes to the tax system. But we have become used to the fact that the government just cannot get it right. This bill is proof again tonight that it is still making mistakes that it has to correct at the eleventh hour. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>16087</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to express our overall support for the intentions of the <inline ref="R1036">A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 2) 2000.</inline> I believe it is the last bill to establish elements of the new tax system before it takes effect this coming Saturday. It deals primarily with compliance and administration by introducing a uniform administrative penalty regime for all taxation laws. This particular bill is the second slab of legislation on the new compliance scheme, with the third slab containing the recommendations from the Ralph report yet to come to the Senate. The regime that is chosen is modelled very closely on the Income Tax Assessment Act provisions but is now to be extended much wider. In our view, it is not a controversial piece of legislation. The only particularly controversial aspects are the provisions that deal with the giving of taxation advice. These amendments aim to allay fears about accountants being overwhelmed by the demand to lodge business activity statements after 1 July.</para></talk.start><para>The bill will allow the following people to lodge business activity statements: professional accountants and tax practitioners, bookkeepers working under the direction of registered tax agents and persons who provide payroll bureau services to employers. The Democrats support these particular provisions. However, we are concerned by further provisions in the bill that expand the range of taxation services which may only be provided by a registered tax agent. These amendments particularly restrict the capacity of people who are not registered tax agents from providing general taxation advice. There are special provisions dealing with lawyers providing advice and so on. </para><para>My concern is one that has been raised by the National Tax and Accountants Association in evidence given to the Senate committee about the advice provided by industry bodies. What needs to be highlighted is that, because industry bodies have an annual subscription, they could well fall within the category of persons providing paid tax advice. This would essentially mean that members would no longer be able to obtain tax advice from their industry body or union. Given that much of the GST education campaign effort has been carried out by industry bodies themselves, this would be an unfortunate outcome. In evidence to the Senate committee, the ATO assistant commissioner, Michael Smith, said that the government would introduce amendments to resolve the issue. So far they seem not to have materialised in the form that we expected, although I acknowledge that some changes have been made. </para><para>I want to apologise for the lateness in circulation of Democrat amendment No. 1 in my name on sheet 1870. I propose in the committee stage that, in the absence of clarification from the government, I will move an amendment to allow employer and employee associations to provide tax advice to their members. I also indicate at this stage that, whilst I recognise and note the change made by the House of Representatives to section 251L relating to the giving of advice, I want to put on the record that the National Tax and Accountants Association seems to be convinced that the problem is still not fixed. I want to add also that the provision seems a little out of place when it is really supposed to be about increasing the number of people eligible to submit business activity statements rather than restricting the number of tax advisers themselves. On another note, I ask the government to consider whether, even with the suggested change, that provision might in fact be anticompetitive because, at the moment, that is a little unclear.</para><para>I want to flag pretty early as well that from what I have seen so far I am not persuaded that the problem has entirely been remedied. I understand that the government has further legislation planned dealing with the new registration provisions for tax agents, but I ask Senator Kemp, on behalf of the government, whether it is not better that this issue be part of that review. During the dinner break—and I presume that this happens on many occasions—I received telephone calls from the Australian Tax Office expressing concerns about the Democrats' amendment. Can I ask the government to explain what it sees as the problem with that amendment? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>16088</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not delay the chamber too long, but Senator Cook made one or two references, in addressing the <inline ref="R1036">A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline>, to the Prime Minister's address to the nation tonight. I suppose the first thing we could note is that the Prime Minister was a bit twitchy, which always shows that he is under a bit of pressure. But the real story of that address to the nation is that it is poll driven. The words that dripped out of the Prime Minister's mouth are exactly what is coming through the government polling at the moment. The emphasis that the Prime Minister put on certain concepts was very much driven by public opinion polling. </para></talk.start><para>This government is spending well beyond $2 million across seven different polling exercises to try to assess public opinion and then, in turn, influence it in regard to its tax package. It has given up basically trying to say that the tax package is good for you as an individual. It has gone back to the theme that it had in August 1998—the only one that in the end it was in the positive with during the election campaign or until the Monday before election day—and that is that it is good for the nation. This is the government's last sort of bastion, its last defence about the tax package—that it is good for the nation. It is all poll driven. The taxpayers have paid for that as well. One of the biggest polling efforts in Australian history has gone in on this particular package.</para><para>However, I also wanted to say how excruciatingly embarrassed I was by the Prime Minister's performance this morning, but I must say I was a tad sympathetic as well because maybe it can happen to anyone. The Prime Minister or his staff—it would not have been the Prime Minister; it would have been his staff—were thinking in the last four or five days: what stunt can we pull in the Prime Minister's run around on the Thursday, the last day of parliament, that can get publicity for the GST? </para><para>I thought they showed a bit of prescience in avoiding a cake shop. I thought that was probably pretty bright of them. So they went down to Jim Murphy's grog shop and there, with all the cameras whirring, all the channels present, the Prime Minister got a basket of wine, spirits and beer and put it all in and they then added it up. You could see a bit of sweat on the Prime Minister's brow as he waited for the results. It was like an election night, waiting for the latest results. Then you see that sense of relief on the Prime Minister's face: here you have it, the price of the goods will be $22 cheaper on Saturday than they were today. Cheers go up. Little apparatchiks around at the Prime Minister's office relax. This is terrific. Then suddenly they realise that they had inputted a bottle of scotch twice. `Oh oh, recount. Get the scrutineers in again.' They recount the ballot. `Oh, it will now be more expensive on Saturday than it is was today, Thursday.'</para><para>How would you like to be the bright staffer who thought up this particular stunt right now? It was carried on every news program tonight, and I was a bit embarrassed. Even though I am very partisan in my politics, I felt embarrassed that the Prime Minister of Australia would be so humiliated by this recount. Surely an advance man goes out. Surely, if you are going to pull a stunt like this, you count the amount of the grog several times before you actually wheel the Prime Minister in through the door. So they can spend $430 million, but they cannot afford an advance man. That really does border on the pathetic.</para><para>Equally pathetic was Senator Kemp's performance here today when he refused to release the modelling. Let's face it, that modelling, according to the Prime Minister, is the one verification that the Prime Minister has of being an honest person. We have seen the Prime Minister quote the modelling time and time again, and anything we say on the subject is merely scaremongering. Remember that line, `You're just trying to scare the horses'? Well, we gave the government an opportunity to prove us wrong, to justify its claims that we are scaremongers. The government has the economic modelling that proves it right. But will it produce it? Not at all.</para><para>We have seen other organisations produce their economic modelling — economic modelling that shows that petrol prices are in some ways justified, because the savings the government claims are not there. But the government has that opportunity. It still has that opportunity. Senator Kemp now, in a burst of honesty and enthusiasm to try to defend his leader, could produce that modelling and we would have a justification. I hope this minister is not withdrawing that modelling, not supporting his Prime Minister, because he was not picked in March 1996 in the first-round draft. I hope it is not old enmities coming to the surface here. Senator Kemp, I assume, has read the modelling—I assume it backs up exactly what the Prime Minister says—but refuses to table it in this particular chamber. That is very disappointing. </para><para>But I want to personalise the GST. I arrived home last Friday and discovered that I was out of pipe tobacco—a great tragedy, as everyone would acknowledge. So I pick up the mail, I pick up the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> and I walk up the street and get on the tram to go to the tobacconist. The first thing that hits me is `tram fares are going up by 9.8 per cent'. Fortunately I had the exact money and I was able to take my tram ride because there had been no price rise as yet.</para><para>I open the one letter that I thought might be interesting and find it is from the Melbourne City Council. It is informing me that most council matters are, in fact, not GSTable. That was a relief. But I then read that there is a whole range of commercial activities that are GSTable. If you get your car towed away and have to recover it, you pay GST on it. If you use a parking machine, it is GSTable. If your poor old cat gets caught out at night and is impounded, to recover the cat costs you an extra 10 per cent. If you want to use the local park for a wedding—praise God, I don't have to go through that again—it is an extra 10 per cent. They did not lift it by six, seven or eight but by the full 10 per cent.</para><para>In an absolute state of shock, I shoved that letter in my top pocket and opened the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> and thought, `I'll read the sports pages. At least I can calm down and relax.' There is a big advertisement from the AFL telling us not only where the main games are being played on Friday, Saturday and Sunday but also what the price list is post GST. Guess what? Every one of the items has gone up by 10 per cent: seats, admission—the whole thing up by 10 per cent. I thought, `Surely the AFL can save on some input costs. Surely with the grass they're sold to resurface their oval every second day there are some input costs.' I just wonder exactly what degree of exploitation is going to occur.</para><para>But the coup de grace, of course, is that I stumble off the tram and get into the tobacconist and he tells me everything is going up by 10 per cent next Saturday week. That is the only one that I am not sure will go up by exactly 10 per cent, but that was certainly the tobacconist's view. So here you go, Madam Deputy President: the horror ride on tram No. 8, the horror ride. It is a bit like Colonel Kurtz going up the Mekong: the further you went, the deeper in debt you got.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—<inline font-style="italic">Heart of Darkness</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Exactly, Senator Cook.

That is, all these matters have been advertised and we are not going to go over all the old ground or the $430 million. But one thing that has not been canvassed in this chamber is that the tax commissioner, Mr Carmody, sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor's office as to whether the total package of advertising was, in fact, properly funded and legally based. The advice came from the Australian Government Solicitor on 19 May and was written by Mr Henry Burmeister QC and Special Counsel George Witynski. Let me quote from that advice, and I do not think it has yet at least been tabled in this chamber, but certainly it has been sent to a committee via Mr Carmody. It states:</para><quote><para>"... The material which he [the Taxation Commissioner] sponsors or distributes would in our view be subject to the same restrictions as material produced in his own name. That is, the Commissioner and his office should not participate in the distribution of overtly political material, such as material criticising opponents of the new tax system. In so far as the distribution of material fell within the legitimate role of the Commissioner and his office, it would be useful if the material were identified in some way with the ATO ..." </para></quote><para>That is clearly not the case in the booklet distribution. That is clearly not the case in the Prime Minister's letter. But not only did the legal advice say that the material should not be overtly political, it also said:</para><quote><para>Appropriate authorisations ought to be attached to the material sent out.</para></quote><para>When we read the Prime Minister's letter, there is no authorisation on it at all. Senator Kemp has the document there. You could point out in the Prime Minister's letter where the authorisation is. No, Senator Kemp is not even paying attention; he is off driving ships. Here we have the dilettante minister, off steaming his boats around his bath. Pay attention, Minister; pay attention, please.</para><para>The reality is of course that that letter from the Prime Minister `to my fellow Australians'—but not in fact personalised any more—had no authorisation on it. They might then ask, `Is the authorisation on the main leaflet sufficient?' It has certainly never applied to any electoral material; you have to authorise every separate item. What I found particularly interesting was that, in the actual booklet that was put out, the authorisation is written by C. Ellison. You have to ask yourself the question: why has every other item of publicity been authorised by the Commonwealth government, but this particular one was by C. Ellison? Does anyone believe that in fact C. Ellison wrote the booklet? Of course he did not. The advertising people wrote it. It is almost, if you like, a compilation of a variety of advertisements. That in itself is a lie. I recommend that anyone go back and read the legal opinions given to this government. It has not complied with them, and it has put itself in harm's way because of it. You might be sceptical about that, but the last time we had ministers issuing press releases or coming into this chamber pouring scorn on those who challenged the legality of some aspects of this campaign they ended up with egg on their faces. They ended up having to cancel and pulp eight million letters at a great cost to the Australian taxpayer and at great humiliation to themselves.</para><para>I started off by saying that I thought the Prime Minister's address to the nation did not deal with proper tax matters and that it was basically a political exercise. It was poll driven and it did not warrant an address to the nation. It would not be the first one to fit into that category, I readily concede, but I thought it significant that it was so political that only Channel 2 under the stewardship of Donald McDonald and Mr Shier, and with Michael Kroger on the board, actually ran it live.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>16090</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There have been a number of contributions to this debate.

As part of tax reform, we all know that there is a GST, a new PAYG regime and then there are streamlined consolidated machinery provisions to support the new tax system. To further the process of streamlining the machinery provisions of the tax law, a process which has advantages for both taxpayers and the tax office, the bill establishes a new uniform penalty regime for all taxation laws administered by the commissioner. The uniform penalty regime was not only desirable in its own right because it makes penalties easier to understand and calculate but also necessary to avoid problems with the BAS, business activity statement. One BAS may cover a range of tax obligations such as PAYG and FBT instalments and GST payments. Therefore, it makes sense that if there is a default in relation to a BAS the default does not attract different rates of penalty. The different payments are covered by a single BAS.</para><para>Far from complicating the new tax system, the uniform penalty regime is a step in the direction of simplicity. Apart from anything else, the tax office has calculated that this move will result in a reduction in the number of pages of tax law by about 100 pages. The bill also sets out the classes of tax practitioners who can charge for preparing a BAS. The existing income tax and fringe benefits tax laws basically restrict the right to charge for preparing income tax returns to a registered tax agent. However, it was felt that the right to charge for preparing a BAS should be open to a wider class of practitioners, because there was concern that not everybody who was required to lodge a BAS would have access to or need for the services of a registered tax agent. </para><para>Persons who will be able to charge for providing BAS services include members of recognised professional associations representing accountants and tax practitioners, bookkeepers working under the direction of registered tax agents, persons who provide payroll bureau services to employers and Customs agents. Expanding the categories of people who can charge for BAS services should help to lighten the workload for tax practitioners in what is a very busy time for everyone. The bill also sought to restate the existing position in relation to registered tax agents but not to materially change it. These provisions of the bill were amended to meet the requirements of the professions. They substantially replicate the existing law but are more broadly based to take account of the cross-tax nature of the BAS. </para><para>There are some other important measures in this bill. Perhaps the chief amongst these is the provisions which extend the income tax deductions for plant and software acquired in preparation for the GST. Deductions will now be allowed for equipment and software which is not installed but in respect of which taxpayers have entered into binding contracts. The final part of the bill is a collection of miscellaneous amendments and machinery provisions arising from the new tax system. On the whole, these are purely technical. A number of other issues have been raised, particularly by Senator Ridgeway, and we may address those in the committee stage.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>16092</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>16092</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I intend to be brief. I wanted to raise a serious matter on behalf of a constituent of mine because it does illustrate a particular problem.

This constituent has authorised the release of his details.  </para></talk.start><para>It concerns a Mr John Axton, who is a newsagent in Devonport. He runs Store 44 Newsagency, which is owned and operated by the Llanfair Trust. His accountant applied electronically for an ABN on 31 May. When he spoke to me on Tuesday afternoon, despite four calls to the helpline he had not yet been given his ABN. He is extremely concerned that, without the ABN, there are two serious consequences. One is the issue of the 48.5c tax, but what he considers to be more serious, in the short term at least, is that the suppliers of his newspapers and magazines will not supply him with those goods until he provides his ABN to the newspaper and magazine companies, and time is running out. I would not expect you, Minister, to be able to respond to this matter now, but I would appreciate your officers taking the matter up. </para><para>Unfortunately, it does illustrate a couple of very serious matters. Maybe the minister can tell us how many applications for ABNs have not yet been processed? How many applications for ABNs have gone astray or been lost, for whatever reason?

The commissioner issued a press statement very recently indeed. With more than 2.7 million ABNs issued and about 2.8 million applications received, I think that provides the general figures that you were seeking, Senator.

We will not be accepting your amendment. We have consulted very widely on this. Many aspects of this legislation which have gone through have received very wide consultation.

I think I am well known for my courtesy and, despite the fact the hour is late, I do not alter my normal form of behaviour on these matters. I think the way you brought in the introduction rather suggested to my officers that you were reading from an earlier version of the bill. You then drew our attention to `on behalf of a taxpayer'. What we are dealing with is `on behalf of a member of an organisation'. That is where the confusion has come about. You can give advice to a member of an organisation. There is a distinction. I am making a distinction here between a taxpayer and a member of an organisation. There may be a difference of opinion here, but all I can say is I have the officers from the Taxation Office beside me; I have read out the EM; they have listened very carefully to Senator Ridgeway and to you, as they should, and they have provided me with clear advice that what you are seeking to achieve is already achieved in the bill. So the intention of the amendment is not necessary. Further, they say that the amendment itself has technical problems and is unduly restrictive.</para></talk.start><para>The point I would make is that the state laws preclude people other than solicitors and barristers from giving advice on all laws.

I can see you are seeking assurances, and this is a fairly technical matter. Both you and I have great knowledge in these matters, but we would probably want our advisers to at least take the first cut. That is the advice that I have received. The intention that you want to achieve, Senator Ridgeway, is already in the bill. Therefore, we do not need this amendment. </para><para>The other assurance I can give you—just to repeat what I said a bit earlier on—is that this section of the bill has been given a great deal of attention by the professional bodies. Let me assure you that the professional bodies have looked very closely at this matter.

I am still not clear—and I understand what is being said—about the distinction between a taxpayer and where there is no mention at all about an individual within an organisation. It seems to me that the definition of `taxpayer' has got to be clear on the face of it as to what it means. Whilst I acknowledge that you have agreed about industry associations—such as the National Farmers Federation, the Motor Trades Association, and so on—and drawn attention to the fact that there may be some drafting flaws with the amendment, what I am seeking to do is to avoid penalties being given to those that perhaps might provide general tax advice to the members of their organisation or association. At the moment, the bill seems to contemplate that where advice has been given people are potentially liable for a penalty of $2,200. That is quite a legitimate issue to raise because of what appears to be an uncertainty in the government's proposal. I acknowledge that where it talks about giving advice about a taxation law it really says `on behalf of a taxpayer'. What does `a taxpayer' mean? That is the heart of the issue.

The <inline ref="R1053">New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> is a seemingly innocuous piece of legislation in respect of its treatment of life insurance companies. I refer specifically to the section with respect to life insurance companies, because it was a seemingly innocuous section until the Labor Party discovered two areas of concern. I here have to acknowledge a number of organisations which brought matters to our attention and provided the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services with some very important submissions. The organisations which made submissions and contacted the Labor opposition—and I understand they spoke to the Democrats as well—are: the Corporate Superannuation Association, William M. Mercer, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Actuaries, Superannuation Australia Pty Ltd, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association. There were a number of others, but they are some of the better known organisations.  </para></talk.start><para>Labor has two main concerns about these seemingly innocuous provisions with respect to life insurance. The first one is the way in which the government is raising revenue in respect of capital gains tax. Firstly, it was not readily identifiable from the explanatory memorandum just exactly how much money was being raised by the changes to capital gains tax until the committee hearings that were held on Monday of this week, when we were questioning Senator Kemp and Treasury officials. I did ask what the extent of revenue being raised from this capital gains tax change was going to be and we were told by Treasury officials that it would be $70 million per year. This was an unknown figure and this is, effectively, $70 million per year being taken out of superannuation funds around Australia. Industry representatives claim it will be considerably more than $70 million, so we know it is a minimum. Some in industry say it may be $100-odd million per year. That is, Australian pensioners and annuants will be at least $70 million a year worse off as a result of the capital gains tax changes.</para><para>It is important to note that this will affect some people more than others. Those effects can vary significantly and they can also be very significant in terms of the impact on individuals. We were provided with some important case studies and examples of the severe adverse effect in some respects on some individuals. I did ask at those hearings for the government to supply any modelling that was done on this change to capital gains tax, assuming that some modelling had to be done to calculate the $70 million per year that Treasury estimate is raised by this measure. I did also request modelling that I hoped had been done on the net impact of this change on superannuation funds resulting from the full range of measures in the bill, and particularly the long-term impact on retirement income and government outlays. </para><para>The other area of concern is increased complexity. This government has a well-known track record of imposing additional burdens on superannuation funds in this country—there have been some very notable examples in recent years. All witnesses before the committee highlighted that the provisions in this bill that require superannuation funds and life offices to value assets as at 1 July 2000 and to segregate these assets relating to the payment of pensions would greatly increase the complexity of superannuation. There would be increased compliance costs, and witnesses acknowledged that there was no doubt this bill would significantly increase compliance costs for superannuation funds and life offices. </para><para>Mr Michael Lorimer, who is a director of the Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association, led by a former Liberal member of parliament—I cannot remember his name—and who is not too pleased about this piece of government legislation, stated that the current $2,000 to $2,500 costs of managing a small superannuation fund would be expected to double to around $4,000 as a result of this bill as a result of greater compliance costs in general and, of course, that must impact on lower retirement incomes. </para><para>What I found very surprising about the change in the capital gains tax that the government is proposing is that all the witnesses before the committee, except for one, stated that this bill is applying a retrospective capital gains tax change to July 1988. This retrospective change to capital gains tax goes back to the time of the purchase of an asset, and this could be before July 1988. What is even worse with respect to this retrospectivity is that some of these small do-it-yourself superannuation funds own property, and they will be hit not just by retrospectivity but also on some of their own properties that they own through the trust. This is a very important issue, because we have had presented to us a retrospective capital gains tax change netting the government at least an additional $70 million a year.  </para><para>If we cast our minds back to the election campaign, the current government—the Liberal-National Party—were highly critical of our election policy to prospectively change capital gains tax from 1 July 2000. I do recall the Prime Minister saying about our proposed changes to capital gains:</para><quote><para>This change is going to strike at the heart of retirement security of many older Australians. </para></quote><para>What are we being presented with here tonight? A retrospective capital gains tax change raising at least $70 million a year.</para><para>It was none other than the Prime Minister himself who condemned an alleged retrospective capital gains tax in Labor's policy in the lead-up to the last election. How times change. We had the Prime Minister's never ever commitment about the GST. We have seen numerous examples in recent weeks—petrol prices, beer prices, rents—of where commitments have been broken on the GST. This really has to be the most blatant breach of an election commitment given by a Prime Minister of this country, and it goes to the heart of an issue the government chose to make central to the last election campaign: retrospective capital gains tax changes.</para><para>There are a number of other problems with the legislation that we have been presented with. The government did admit for the first time that the provisions of this bill relating to the capital gains tax of superannuation funds and life offices will lead to an additional $70 million in tax. That does not include the additional costs of compliance to superannuation funds, and that can only come from either higher fees and charges or more tax from members' superannuation accounts that will result in lower pensions, annuities and lump sums. Whoever is in government, the policy should be to encourage the taking of pensions and annuities rather than lump sums. We should be encouraging the taking of these products, not discouraging them as we have with this legislation.</para><para>It was interesting that Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, who presented himself before the committee for some 20 minutes of very brief questioning, did admit that the legislation was very complex and would probably require further legislation down the track in order to deal with the complexities and the additional costs—but not with removing the retrospective $70 million in capital gains tax. We did welcome this admission from Senator Kemp that further changes would be needed. There is just one problem with changing this legislation at some time in the future. The problem is that, if this legislation is passed unamended, those superannuation funds that provide pension annuity products are going to have to change those products over the next few months to conform with the law that was proposed to be passed here tonight—that is if the amendments that I understand have been drawn up were not to be passed. </para><para>So superannuation funds will only have had 90 days to segregate their assets from 1 July. This is a very inappropriate way to regulate superannuation funds in this country. To expect them to change their funds at significant cost then to have to wait for additional government amendments in order to avoid the compliance costs that I have mentioned is an absurd way to approach the regulation of superannuation in this country. It is not consistent; it does not provide security.</para><para>There are many thousands of people who would be affected in corporate superannuation funds—particularly impressive evidence was given to the committee on that—do-it-yourself funds, which tend to cover the small business sector and self-employed contractors, and some industry funds that provide these particular products. The Democrats, as a result of the committee hearings and the representations from the Labor Party and listening to industry concerns, have drafted some amendments that I think will satisfy most of the concerns of industry. I do acknowledge the work that Senator Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats has done on this and the fine contributions from the industry representatives. I think it shows just how effective the process of a Senate committee can be in drawing to the attention of the government the unfortunate consequences of the legislation that they were to present. </para><para>To conclude, the amendments that are being made that will minimise the impact on the internal structures of funds—the requirement to disaggregate assets—will be a significant help to funds that offer pension annuity products. But I find it startling and very hypocritical of the government to be presenting a retrospective change to capital gains tax in this country after the song and dance we had from them at the last election about Labor's proposals. This is $70 million a year of retrospective capital gains tax changes—additional tax to a number of superannuation funds in this country. Not only that; it was not until we questioned Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, and Treasury officials that we discovered what this quantum of money was—what the impact of these changes to capital gains tax was going to be—and it turned out to be at least $70 million. This figure was hidden. You could not identify it in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Time is brief; we cannot speak a great deal tonight on the monumental hypocrisy of this government in respect of retrospective capital gains tax changes, in particular the quote I referred to from the Prime Minister—the Prime Minister who made constant references to this issue prior to the last election, particularly the impact on elderly Australians and their right to a safe, secure and predictable retirement income. This bill changes that for many Australians, and that is an indictment of the Prime Minister for some of the comments made at the last federal election. I understand the amendments have been circulated by the Democrats, and I understand we are supporting them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>16100</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1053">New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> contains a number of major provisions arising out of the Ralph report and one or two other controversial provisions which were not in the Ralph report. I will deal very briefly with the main provisions before coming back to the key superannuation question I want to discuss. The first measure in the bill is capital gains tax relief on scrip for scrip rollovers. The Democrats have in principle supported scrip for scrip rollover relief. However, the provision proposed by the government goes much further than that proposed by the Ralph report. The Ralph report did not support scrip for scrip relief being extended to closely held private companies. The concerns were that, in those cases, there was a real chance of major tax avoidance. However, in the Treasurer's announcement, it was extended to all companies. In evidence to the Senate committee, taxation law professor Rick Krever, who was a consultant to the Ralph report, strongly warned against that. Unfortunately, in ticking off the business tax reform, the ALP has ticked off what we think is potentially a huge tax avoidance loophole. All I can say is that I hope the Australian Taxation Office monitors the operation of the proposed clause very closely to make sure that it does not become a new tax avoidance shelter.</para></talk.start><para>The second measure in the bill is the taxation of life offices. This was another key recommendation from the Ralph report that will see the investments of life offices taxed at the same rates and conditions as those of other companies. This is a major revenue measure worth around $200 million a year. This measure deals with the tax treatment of losses such as inter-entity loss multiplication and the treatment of company losses and bad debts. These are important integrity measures that flow out of the Ralph reforms and will be supported by the Democrats.</para><para>The third major set of amendments deal with imputation credits allowing small shareholders with franking rebates of up to $5,000 to no longer be subject to the 45-day holding rules. The PAYG instalments will also recognise franking credits. There are some technical changes to the operation of capital gains tax, new integrity measures on the PAYG tax system and changes to the prepayments measure. The Democrats will be supporting all of those provisions. I will, however, be moving to modify the operation of a provision of the life offices schedule. This deals with the capital gains tax treatment of superannuation funds. The measure makes it clear that, when a member's account moves from the accumulation phase to the pension phase, capital gains tax liability will arise in respect of the capital gain during the accumulation phase. Although the liability will not be paid until the asset is sold, the bill will require evaluation of the actual assets to be segregated to support the pension draw down. This measure was not announced in the Ralph report but has arisen because of a government concern that some people are using the ability to change assets to supporting pensions and thereby avoiding capital gains tax. It has been suggested that this is a particular problem in the small funds sector. </para><para>On the one hand, we are faced with a bill that is supposedly part of the Ralph business tax reforms but is not mentioned anywhere in them, and industry clearly has not been adequately consulted on the bill—a point which has now been acknowledged by the minister. On the other hand, the government estimates that this bill will raise $70 million by closing down a tax advantage perceived to be held by smaller super funds and not available to larger super funds on the transfer of funds from accumulation to pension stream funding. It is also clear that this bill deals with issues of immense complexity, potentially greatly increases compliance costs and appears to catch in its wake many larger superannuation funds which were not intended to be caught by it—if the government's objectives are to be believed. The Democrats are particularly concerned that the bill has the potential to adversely affect larger corporate and industry superannuation funds and could potentially make pensions less attractive as superannuation options. Having said that, the Democrats are aware that some operators will use superannuation tax concessions however they can to obtain maximum tax benefit, thereby reducing revenue collections. We agree that the revenue needs to be protected.</para><para>This is the latest in a number of measures directed by the government against small do-it-yourself funds. This has been a growing sector of the market, and it is also a very lucrative one. Whether the growth in the sector is driven by better returns or by tax planning is a fundamental policy issue, in our view. A clear policy statement is needed because considering legislation of this type is difficult in the absence of such a policy direction. The Democrats believe that it will be extremely difficult between now and the end of the week for the Senate to draft appropriate amendments to achieve the government's objective while meeting the industry objective of minimising compliance costs and ensuring that pensions remain an attractive objective for corporate and industry super funds.</para><para>Given this difficulty, I will be moving to excise the provisions dealing with superannuation and the segregation of assets for capital gains tax purposes. I wish to emphasise that the Democrats do support this measure in principle. We want the government to sit down now with industry and to work on developing alternative evaluation methods that protect revenue with a much lower compliance cost. There were a number of suggestions put to the Senate committee. I understand that the government is already exploring alternative approaches with various industry groups. The Democrats urge the government to complete that process as soon as possible. We would be prepared to support an urgent bill in the August sittings to impose the capital gains tax rule that the government is seeking, provided we are satisfied that the compliance cost issues that industry has referred to have been adequately dealt with.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>16101</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been listening to the debate very carefully, and I think tonight is a little bit of a sad night for superannuation in this country. We are almost within a cooee of getting a deal. The undertakings that were given by the minister were very gracious about negotiating, and that still holds. Given the early commencement date on 1 July, we acknowledge some funds—particularly the life companies and others—have the software and have put in place the segregation of assets. I wonder where all this is going to leave everybody. I was told today that one of the leading lawyers in Melbourne is anxiously ringing up his clients saying, `Put all your holiday homes in your superannuation funds to avoid capital gains tax, because there's a real loophole.' That is why I say that it is a sad day: this message is being conveyed to the sharp end of town. That will effectively be the outcome, and that is why I do urge us to try and get some sort of nice outcome within a short period after 1 July. It would be better, because these sorts of messages get around the industry very quickly. How are we going to stop it? Are we going to introduce retrospective legislation? We all have an abhorrence of that. </para></talk.start><para>Perhaps people could think about these things for a little longer to see whether there might be a way out and to get a better outcome than what I see coming presently. The minister was disappointed that it did appear that a number of witnesses changed their minds from what they had told him earlier. But the information that was given to our committee was very solid information, and the committee acted on that. We took a very responsible attitude to it. The sad part about it was that it all came so late in the session, with just two or three days to go. There is a need to try and get an outcome at an earlier opportunity. I have had a quick look at some of the amendments, Senator Allison, and I am worried about what might be happening to the industry in the meantime. I am not sure whether you would like to defer it—I know it is late—for half an hour or so while we think about these sorts of things. It would be a terrible outcome if the sharp edge of town had these sorts of arrangements. I thank the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>16102</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government wants to proceed with the <inline ref="R1053">New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> as the bill is currently before the chamber.

For reasons that you have stated in relation to tax avoidance issues, I would have thought the Democrats and the Labor Party would have supported this measure.

When it became clear that there were not the numbers to get this bill through, there was another round of consultation and then another round of consultation on top of that. It was to my regret, because I have carriage of the bill in this chamber, that they were not fruitful in the end. Others will make their judgments about this matter. The anomaly that we are trying to deal with has been pointed to by quite a few commentators, and you have pointed to it in a pretty graphic way in your remarks this evening, Senator Watson. But this does not persuade the Democrats, and it does not persuade the Australian Labor Party. In view of the work which has gone into the bill and in view of the importance of the bill, I would urge the Senate to make sure that it is passed as it has been drafted.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Sherry suggested that the bill is retrospective. I do not agree with Senator Sherry on this matter. The bill does not apply CGT retrospectively. It applies the special CGT provisions that apply to complying superannuation funds to tax capital gains accrued in the accumulation phase—provisions which were brought in by the Labor government in 1988. It was a bit rich of Senator Sherry to go on when the Labor government brought in capital gains and applied it to the accumulation phase of superannuation funds in 1988. </para><para>Let me turn to the issue of the segregation of assets. There is a very significant diversity of views in the industry, but the government is happy to continue to consult with the industry on this matter. I signalled that very clearly. This is a very complex issue. The truth is that we have been told by certain sections of the industry that they found the arrangements in the bill quite workable. However, other sections of the industry indicated it did not suit them. We said to them, `We will work with you.' I say this again this evening, Senator Allison: we will work with you to see whether we can arrive at a solution. I am happy to go on record and say that. But it is a very technical matter. My view was that we would work towards a solution that may well provide an alternative, perhaps a formula, where funds would be given the option if they wished to use that method or the method in the bill. I have given that commitment. I gave it before the committee; I give it here tonight. There is no lack of a commitment by the government to see whether we can deal with the problem that certain funds have brought to our attention.  </para><para>There is no lack of commitment to see if we can work towards a solution to deal with that problem. That is no reason to hold this bill up. In taxation law, quite frequently we bring in bills and then a bill will have an unintended consequence and we deal with that. So, Senator Allison, there is no lack of commitment on that front. If there has been a misunderstanding on your part about that, I have restated it in this chamber. </para><para>We will look at issues that the industry raises with us and we will work to see whether we can get a solution. But, after widespread consultation with the industry, the industry was well aware of the provisions of the bill and has prepared for this bill. In relation to the issue of DIY funds, the government adopted the amendment proposed by ASFA to cope with the transitional arrangements. That again showed the government was flexible and prepared to meet concerns, so the government bent over backwards to get this bill through. I would urge the Senate to pass the bill in the form that has been presented to the Senate this evening.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>16103</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>16103</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I did not have the opportunity to speak in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1053">New Business Tax System (Miscellaneous) Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline> and I want to make a couple of comments for Senator Kemp. I am part of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that considered this matter and I listened to Senator Watson and others speak in the debate. Firstly, I believe that the complexities are an important issue and that you cannot pass that part of the legislation without having overcome the complexities. </para></talk.start><para>The unintended consequences are not unintended at all. They are consequences that were predicted at our hearing last week. So it is not valid to use that argument at all. In fact, I think the committee bent over backwards to cooperate in dealing with this piece of legislation because, when we met last Monday, originally we were set to meet between 8.30 a.m. and 12 p.m. and then, as more witnesses came on board—there was a very limited time for the canvassing of witnesses—we extended the sitting time to 12.30 p.m., which was the limit. We considered all the matters before us, and I must say the impression that was clearly created in my mind was that there were people expressing genuine concern about this part of the legislation. </para><para>Moreover, we actually considered the committee's report in the chamber on Monday at 9.45 p.m. and at that stage we did not even have access to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, which was another complexity that was facing the committee. I think it would be fair to say that the committee considered this legislation as best it could and that the witnesses that presented evidence to us did so as best they could. There were real doubts in our mind which made the Labor senators put forward the concept of excising that part—with the agreement of the Democrats—that needs greater consideration. So Senator Kemp's claim for the whole bill to be passed tonight is a bit too rich. We should see that part excised and then passed at a later date after proper consideration has been given to it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>16103</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to move amendments Nos 1 to 17 together. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—No, unfortunately, you cannot do that because we have some here where you are opposing parts of schedules and others where you are moving amendments.

We are dealing here with just a small section of the bill; a section which has been identified as being hugely problematic.

We actually need some real action on this bill and that is why we are seeking to have this section of the legislation excised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>16104</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To save time, I will speak to the overall set of Democrat amendments.

I think, by and large, senators have done that, recognising their responsibilities.</para></talk.start><para>There is, however, a major problem here tonight insofar as we have been informed that the appropriation bills have to be considered and concluded tonight. This is a matter that, in my judgment, the opposition should have been made aware of much earlier. It is a view that, in fact, may well be disputed. The government has had a program outlined before us for a fortnight. It had clearly two weeks of sittings to consider various pieces of legislation and has at all times scheduled the appropriation bills for Thursday—that is today. So it strikes me as odd to be told now, at about 9 o'clock, that these appropriation bills have to be considered tonight. I think that that is not a good way to run the business of the Senate. If it is the legal case that the government wishes to put to us, I believe they should have put it to us much earlier. The program should have included a proposition where these matters were considered at a much earlier point.</para><para>Nonetheless, I would also like to indicate that the government has cooperated fully with the opposition insofar as consideration of the program this week and last week goes. The opposition has been able to put views to the government which the government has fully cooperated with. So I return the favour to Senator Campbell and those who consider these issues. I understand that the program of course has at all times been the government's prerogative, but our options, I think, have been considered throughout the last fortnight.

Those changes have all been accepted in the other place, bar two. The message that has come back here includes a schedule of two variations to what was agreed by the Senate. If it is appropriate for me to say so, I do not think the changes will cause concern to the other side. The first item related to the liability of public servants, which we sought to put in a form that we understood to be the existing law. The Labor Party changed that in this place. On reflection, and because of the differences of view on this matter, we thought that the best option was to delete the provision altogether. So whatever might be the existing law, as it relates to public servants in the event that they are negligent, will apply if the Senate accepts the House's message in this regard.</para><para>The second concern is in relation to the inclusion of the precautionary principle. We have accepted that principle, but rather than state it as the precautionary principle as such—which was the form of the amendment passed in the Senate—because there are many meanings attached to that expression, and to avoid uncertainty, we have instead sought to specify what we understand to be the precautionary principle as it relates to this particular matter. In relation to the amendment before the committee, we said:</para><quote><para>The Minister may be satisfied that material is capable of causing serious harm to the marine environment even though there is no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relationship between the input of the material into the marine environment and serious harm to the marine environment.</para></quote><para>That is as we understand the precautionary principle, so we have translated what we believe to be its meaning into the substantive provisions of the bill. I bring this message back and, as I said, most of the amendments have been accepted. I think the two changes we have made are not inconsistent with the desires as expressed by the other sides during the earlier debate in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>16107</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to respond to the minister, I indicate that we are pleased on this side of the parliament that the government has picked up most of the amendments of the Senate. We thought they were amendments that were appropriate for the support of this parliament. It seems like the minister's representative in the lower house is a lot more perceptive about the value of these amendments than the minister has been. As a consequence, the government has seen fit to accept most of them. As to the two that the minister referred to, on the first one—the protection of agents of the Crown—we would have liked to have had the amendment that was passed in this place supported by the government. However, the government, by coming back with its proposal this evening, essentially leaves this issue to be developed through the common law in the way that it has developed over recent years. We think that is probably not a bad way to proceed with this issue, and we are prepared to accept the government's solution to that. </para></talk.start><para>In respect of the application of the precautionary principle, the minister offers the parliament something fairly close to the precautionary principle in article III of the protocol. There are some subtle differences. For instance, the protocol refers to `harm', whereas the minister has offered the words `a threat of serious harm'. I have reason to believe that that criterion is the same in both the protocol and the government's amendment. The concept of no conclusive evidence to prove a causal relationship, I think, is pretty close to the protocol itself. The minister's proposal requires that the minister may be satisfied. That may balance the negative impact of the prerequisite seriousness of the harm. In a sense, though there are some differences, we take the minister's interpretation as being pretty close to what the precautionary principle would state and, as a consequence, find that the second amendment proposed by the government is acceptable to us as well. On that basis, we will not be opposing the message from the House of Representatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>16108</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The precautionary principle is that you do not allow harmful material into the environment until it is shown to be safe.

I am certainly glad that the minister is seeking to meet the desires of the Senate in relation to the amendments that were made to this bill the first time it came before us. I hope that that approach is repeated in relation to the desires that the Senate expresses on a range of bills, and certainly a range of environment bills, that may be brought before us in the not too distant future. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to the first additional amendment made by the House of Representatives, the argument put forward by the minister is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances when you are dealing with legal interpretation. The second amendment, which provides a substitution for articulating the precautionary principle without calling it the precautionary principle but tries to meet some of the intent of the Senate in putting the precautionary principle in the bill originally, in some ways flags the need to have further debate on what that phrase `precautionary principle' means and what it should mean. Senator Brown just gave a very succinct outline of what it should mean in relation to environmental legislation, indeed any legislation, when you are considering a precautionary approach to environmental impacts. By virtue of this message coming back, I think it indicates that perhaps this concept should be explored further to ensure that it is more broadly understood and hopefully adhered to, and incorporated in, legislation more clearly in the future. </para><para>Nonetheless, in this context, I think amendment (2) put forward here, which does not purport to be the precautionary principle but seeks to be a replacement for it, does go a fair way towards meeting the aims or the desires of the Senate. Beyond that, the position of the Democrats is academic in terms of whether or not the amendment gets through. It will go through, given what others have said here tonight. I think that indicates that this is something that needs to be debated more fully in this place. If this is a genuine attempt, as I believe it is, by the government to meet the intent of the Senate in ensuring that the precautionary principle is met, perhaps we should spend a bit more time talking about it so that we do recognise where we are all coming from on that issue and the importance of it. It is a principle that many people seek to insert in legislation with a range of aims. It may be a lot easier in the long run if we recognise, agree on and reach a shared position on what that is all about and how important it is, rather than having to come back to this de facto approach with each particular bill every time parties with concern for the environment try to put forward precautionary principles. </para><para>Beyond that, I take this opportunity, given it is probably the last chance I will get, to wish the minister well in his attempts to expand the whale sanctuary in the southern Pacific over the next week or so in the fair city of Adelaide. I note that 28,000 petitioners had their petition presented to the Senate today requesting action to create a safe haven for whales—not a temporary safe haven but a permanent safe haven for whales in all waters. Certainly, the Democrats support the attempt by the minister and the government to expand the protection for whales and wish the government and all the people involved in the discussions and meetings in Adelaide over the next week or so well with that aim in mind. Given that this bill does at least refer to activities at sea, then probably the issue of protecting whales has some relevance. Having given Democrat support and wishes for the actions of the government in relation to that activity over the next week or so, we are willing to indicate that we will not insist on the original amendments and, in this context, are willing to support the amendments that the House of Representatives has presented to the Senate on this occasion.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Resolution reported; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EXCISE AMENDMENT (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16109</page.no><id.no>R1029</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1030</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16109</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>16109</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1029">Excise Amendment (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 2000</inline> and the <inline ref="R1030">Customs Amendment (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 2000</inline> propose amendments to the Customs Tariff Act and the Excise Tariff Act to enable implementation of the new tax arrangements for alcoholic beverages from 1 July 2000—that is now in about 25½ hours time. To implement these changes, a package of legislative changes will be introduced in four stages. There will be amendments to the excise and customs tariff legislation to give effect to the administrative arrangements for the collection of excise for alcoholic beverages not currently subject to excise. There will also be alterations to the tariff acts by proposal to include all Australian made and imported alcoholic beverages, other than those subject to the WET, in schedules to the tariff acts and to adjust the tariff rates of alcohol products to offset the removal of the wholesale sales tax. These proposals will be tabled in parliament before the end of the financial year, and I understand that that has already been done.</para></talk.start><para>The other two stages that these packages usher in are amendments to regulations to extend the licensing provisions and other requirements to alcoholic beverages not previously subject to excise or customs duty, and bills amending the Customs Tariff Act to incorporate the changes made by the tariff proposals which will be introduced later in the year. I draw to the attention of the Senate that earlier today the Senate carried a resolution concerning the adjustment of tariffs, in which the process is that the House can adjust the tariffs. We believe that that is a wrong process: it should be something that is done by both chambers. Amendments to the Custom Tariff Act will provide the main mechanism to reform the taxation of alcoholic beverages. These amendments will be made by tariff proposals and will be tabled in the parliament before the end of the current financial year.</para><para>The industry position in relation to all of these bills is that the Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia supports the new tax regime and other administrative proposals inthe bills. The only dissenting voice, I am advised, is the manufacturer of Two Dogs, now foreign owned but still based in Adelaide. Two Dogs is a wine based beverage which currently enjoys a substantial advantage over similar RTD products that are made up from spirits. The whole point of the new regime is to tax all RTDs at a common rate, whether they are based on wine or on spirits, and to base the tax on the beer rate of excise or customs duty. The opposition will not be opposing this legislation. We have reservations which we have expressed—and so has this chamber—about the structure of tariff amendments, but we will not be opposing this legislation as such. </para><para>I should just say a few words, though, about the engulfing debate on beer and the misleading statements by the Prime Minister and the government on how beer is to be treated in the current taxation regime. It is a disgrace, in my view, that prior to the election the Prime Minister announced to everyone that ordinary beer would only go up by 1.9 per cent but, after the election, we find that the real rate of increase is between eight per cent and nine per cent. The Prime Minister has then gone on to say that he had meant bottleshop carton beer and not beer that is bought across the bar, and has tried to argue that the service component is responsible for the difference. That is, of course, not true. Once again, this government has been substantially caught out in misleading the Australian people as to the effects of their whole package of taxation measures under the GST.</para><para>The most spectacular catch-out occurred as an unforced error by the Prime Minister today. I am not sure whether his address to the nation—which was screened on television tonight at 7.30 p.m.—was recorded before the stunt at Jim Murphys Market Wine Cellars and whether that was aimed as an item for the late-night news. Certainly, if you take the demeanour of the Prime Minister in his address to the nation—the monotone mumble, the facial tic, the awkward stare—as being something that he would have tried to avoid, then you have to come to the conclusion—I am not sure how many takes it tookin order to get the monotone right—that it occurred after the Jim Murphys cellars incident and that he was unsettled by once again being revealed in a misleading stunt, on the eve of the introduction of the GST, that was meant to dramatise that the GST is supposed to make savings for ordinary Australians, as the Prime Minister often contends.</para><para>Let us revisit what actually happened. There was a stunt, clearly organised by his office. Jim Murphys Market Wine Cellars was the venue. A group of wine and spirit products were purchased; the two bills of sale were presented to the television cameras, showing the price before the GST and after the GST; and we discovered that a saving of some $22 was made. The Prime Minister beamed at the cameras in a ready-prepared television smile—the sort of chilling grin that we are now used to seeing him smugly deliver—and said, `Good by anyone's language!' That was the sound bite for the night. Only later was it revealed that, when you actually added up the cost of the purchase, rather than a reduction of about $22 from before to after the GST, there was actually an increase of about $1.42. The price was not a reduction but an increase. This is a major blue by the Prime Minister, a major attempt to mislead the Australian community. But this, of course, has another lesson embedded in it: if the Prime Minister cannot get it right less than 36 hours away from the introduction of the GST, how can anyone else in Australia be expected to understand this new, regressive tax that imposes 10 per cent on almost everything? If the Prime Minister cannot get it right and is engaging in a stunt to try to mislead the Australian community, how can you believe anything that this man says about his legislation?</para><para>We then watched him on television, assuring us in a full-scale, paid political advertisement that this new tax would in fact be of some benefit to the community—hardly a credible performance. As I said in an earlier address this evening, it marks an entirely new low in public life in Australia. What we saw from the Prime Minister tonight was neither an explanation about the tax nor an effort totry to explain what would happen, but a description—as I have said, in his boring, unregulated monotone—of the government's alleged achievements in the economy: what they have done in the past. There is nothing about tax in that! Film from some of the advertisements—paid for by Australian taxpayers and not by the Liberal Party—was inserted in his address to take the emphasis off the Prime Minister. </para><para>The Australian community is beginning to get fed up: $430 million is not enough to explain this tax; the Prime Minister has to command the airwaves tonight. He got it wrong in his `prepared for television' electoral stunt. He did not use the time that he had available to explain his tax at all; he simply ran a pre-election teaser and tried to justify himself in an electioneering way to the Australian community. It is no wonder the brewers of Australia are running a campaign against this government to unmask its duplicity in misleading beer drinkers in Australia about the cost imposts that were to be achieved by the GST.</para><para>It is a clear matter of fact that the Prime Minister's statement that beer prices need not rise by more than 1.9 per cent is untrue and that prices across the bar will go up between eight and nine per cent. It is a clear matter of fact that the major brewers, many of them conservative companies prepared to support the government—and hitherto unabashed supporters of the government—are conducting a public campaign against it because it has misled their customers. They are not responsible for the price rises that will ensue; the government and this tax are. It is a clear matter of fact that the brewers are paying, out of their own pockets, for ads to counter the taxpayer funded government propaganda; the Australian taxpayers are paying for what the government is saying to mislead those very taxpayers about the alleged benefits of its tax. Unfortunately, the rest of us will continue to pay when we cross the bridge from this current tax system to the A New Tax System. I do not commend the legislation to parliament; I will not oppose the legislation when it comes forward for a vote.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>16111</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats are broadly supportive of the measures that are contained in the Excise Amendment (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 2000 and the Customs Amendment (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 2000. We certainly support the items in the bills which form part of the introduction of the new system of alcohol taxation. We have long argued for the need for a rationalisation of alcohol taxation to bring the tax system in line with developments in the market and to reduce the impact of alcohol abuse on the community, so we support the government's moves to introduce a new system of alcohol taxation which ties excise rates to the alcohol content of drinks.</para></talk.start><para>We are very conscious of the impact of alcohol in our society and we think it is vital that all governments consider the health implications of changes to tax and excise treatment of alcohol. We have, as I say, expressed concern in the past about the current taxation treatment of alcohol products; a system that has allowed manufacturers to exploit the different taxation treatment of alcohol products by producing drinks with relatively high alcohol contents that avoid excise because they are made with a wine base. The taxing of alcoholic drinks according to their alcohol content is preferable, we believe, from a health perspective, and the Democrats support this change accordingly. </para><para>We also strongly support maintaining the price differential between low-alcohol beer and full-strength beer. We believe that differential pricing provides an incentive to producers to produce quality low-alcohol products and incentives to consumers to buy low-alcohol products. The increase in the low-alcohol beer market over the last 10 years has been quite remarkable and now, I believe, occupies more than 20 per cent of the beer market in Australia. We believe this is a trend that should be encouraged. We have seen over the past two decades in Australia the dramatic reduction in the road toll that has, we believe, been achieved through a combination of public health campaigns and the useof measures such as random breath testing to enforce blood alcohol limits. They are certainly measures the Democrats support. As I say, we are mindful of these health issues in relation to alcohol and taxation issues. </para><para>We support those items that relate to the home consumption of alcoholic beverages. Currently, Customs regulations must be amended every time someone wishes to enter an alcoholic beverage for home consumption in a bulk container greater than 20 litres. This creates unnecessary delays and we do not believe it is an appropriate use of public resources. Under this amendment, the CEO of Customs can permit certain alcoholic beverages for home consumption to be entered in containers that are greater than 20 litres, where this is appropriate. We believe this will create a more streamlined approvals process, and it therefore is supported by us. We also support item (8) that allows the decision of the CEO of Customs to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will provide an appropriate level of scrutiny to ensure that this provision is not abused.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1029">Excise Amendment (Alcoholic Beverages) Bill 2000</inline> establishes the legislative framework within which the alcohol excise changes will operate on 1 July. The rates of excise have been contained in excise tariff proposal No. 2, which is tabled in the House. An excise tariff proposal takes immediate effect but must be backed up by legislation within the year. We think it is a bit poor that the government can see fit to rush through the bill on definitions by 30 June but not a bill on the actual rates of excise. It would have been a minor drafting exercise to include the rates in this bill rather than in subordinate legislation, but instead the government has moved to utilise the provisions under the Excise Tariff Act to allow it to declare a rate until parliament acts. </para><para>This provision was designed as an anti-avoidance provision to allow new excise rates to take immediate effect while the government rushes the legislation. These conditions do not apply to the rates of alcoholic excise. These rates were announced in the budget on 9 May, seven weeks out from the date they were due to take effect. The government had seven weeks to get the new rates legislated, and this bill is the appropriate mechanism to achieve this aim. The Democrats conclude that the government is running a bit scared of the Senate because it knows that it does not necessarily have the numbers in this place in relation to its excise on beer. Certainly Senator Cook has made reference to that on behalf of the opposition tonight. So we have this ruse by the government, this abuse of the legislative instruments available to it. An unusual power, designed in an emergency as an anti-avoidance measure, has been picked up by the Treasurer to bully the Senate. His message is clear: this proposal will take effect for the full 12 months allowed under the law and then he will dare the Senate to vote it down.</para><para>That is an irresponsible way for a Treasurer to act. Effectively, $1.1 billion of revenue collected by the government from excises over the next year will be collected on the basis that one house of parliament—the Senate—does not support the rate of taxation. The Senate has made its view clear by passing a motion that opposes these excise rates. That is very much on record. The budget papers will now need to reflect this in the statement of contingent liabilities—that is, the fact that $1.1 billion of government revenue is at risk. I do not think the government in good conscience can actually afford to spend that money, given the Senate has expressed quite clearly its opposition to the government's excise measure.</para><para>As has been stated, the Prime Minister made a clear promise about the price of ordinary beer: that it would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent. That promise has clearly not been kept. The Australian Hotels Association, with the approval of the ACCC, has recently advised its members on the rates that will apply from 1 July. It makes salutary reading on how well the Prime Minister's promise, delivered on Sydney radio, has been kept for Sydney drinkers. A schooner of Tooheys Old will rise on 1 July from $2.80 to $2.98—that is, 6.4 per cent. Schooners of Hahn Ice and XXXX Bitter will rise by 20c, or 7.1 per cent. Fosters and VB rises by 21c a schooner—that is, 7.5 per cent. Carlton mid strength rises by 31c a schooner, or 11 per cent. And the light beers—Hahn, XXXX and LightIce—will rise by 32c a litre, or 11.4 per cent, if you prefer. </para><para>The mid strengths and lights are affected also by the Carr Labor government's continuing refusal to maintain the current rebates for low alcohol beer, and I will touch on that briefly in a moment. The draught beer prices are well above the 1.9 per cent `ordinary beer' price rise predicted by the Prime Minister before the last election. I might add that the AHA pricing guide shows that the government has largely got right the price effect of bottled beer through the bottle shop. On a $30 slab the Tooheys strength beers fall in price on 1 July, XXXX rises by one per cent, and the Carlton beers rise by more—from about 1.8 per cent on Powers Bitter, to 1.9 per cent for Carlton Cold, to 2.2 per cent for a Carlton Draught and up to a top of three per cent for the premium stouts.</para><para>By and large, the government does appear to have set rates for bottle shop beer that are about right, give or take a few cents here and there. That is almost certainly because of the $150 million reduction in the beer excise rates announced in the budget six or so weeks ago. I cannot help but conclude that that reduction was a direct result of the Democrats' strong statement on ensuring that the government must keep its promises on beer excise rates. The budget was a `fessing up' by the Treasurer, admitting that the government's original rates would not have delivered even the promises on cartons contained in ANTS. That reduction was welcome and necessary.</para><para>The Democrats do not support the excise rates for draught beer. This is clearly a broken promise, and a promise that we expect the government to keep. At present, five states provide rebates on wholesale sales tax for low alcohol beer—every state but Peter Beattie's Queensland. But, of the five states providing a low alcohol rebate now, four have committed to keeping them: the coalition states of Western Australia and South Australia and the Labor states of Tasmania and Victoria. Premier Carr refuses to do so. We find that scandalous. His government recently declared a $600 million budget surplus. They could find the $140 million to prop up Michael Knight's SOCOG efforts, but they cannot—or will not—find the funds to pursue a very valid public health consideration of making low alcohol beer price effective. The Democrats believe that Premier Carr's attitude on increasing taxes on low alcohol beer—because that is effectively what the New South Wales government will be doing from 1 July—requires reform. I hope that the Treasurer does follow up on his threat to impose low alcohol subsidies on New South Wales, if needed, by a federal subsidy grant scheme, and obviously dock New South Wales for the bill.</para><para>In conclusion, I am disappointed that this government has decided to treat the parliament and its processes effectively with contempt and to treat as fools Australian beer drinkers when it comes to beer excise. The rates should be in this bill so that parliament can decide the rate of taxation, rather than in a regulation of uncertain duration. Most importantly, the government's commitments to ordinary beer should be honoured in full. Ordinary beer remains ordinary whether it comes out of the bar or the bottle shop, and the 1.9 per cent rise commitment should be kept for both.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16113</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all participants in this debate and commend the bills to the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2000-2001</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>16113</page.no><id.no>R1076</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 2) 2000-2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1075</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2000-2001</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1074</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>16113</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Boswell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>16113</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The budget outlined in these bills is based on accounting scams and bottom line deceptions. Labor identified three scams on budget night, and each of these scams has been acknowledged by either the government, bureaucrats or by academia as a scam. The first scam is the treatment of the sale of digital spectrum. The government is treating the sale of this asset as revenue. This is wrong. The government said it would not include asset sales in its bottom line. The Prime Minister used to believe that counting asset sales as revenue in the budget was wrong. In May 1995 he said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>I have very strong beliefs that what will happen is that the Government will bring in a phoney balance. It will produce a budget where there is a balance but it will arrive at that balance by including the proceeds of assets sales, which of course is a phoney way of arriving at a balance ... I would imagine that the public will see through that, and will be very angry at having been deceived by the Government.</para></quote><para>The government should not have included the sale of digital spectrum to boost its bottom line. This has been confirmed by Treasury. In Senate estimates on 3 May 2000 I asked Greg Smith, Executive Director of the Budget Group at Treasury, how the sale of digital spectrum should be treated. He said:</para><motion><para>That is analogous to the land case that I was referring to, so they would be in the underlying figures. </para></motion><para>That is, the proceeds from the sale of digital spectrum should not be in the headline figures but included in the underlying cash or accrual budget results. Scam No. 1: the Treasurer is disproved by his own department. How can the Treasurer be believed? This budget surplus is a phoney.</para><para>I turn now to the second scam identified by Labor on budget night: the treatment of the $1.65 billion GST compensation package to the states. On budget night the Treasurer claimed the GST compensation package to the states should be treated as a loan and not an outlay. This is nothing more than a scam. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, cannot legitimately name one state Treasurer or Auditor-General who supports his position.</para><para>Mr Foss, the Western Australian Liberal Attorney-General, said in reply to a question as to whether the balancing loan of approximately $150 million being paid by the Commonwealth to the state in 2000-01 was a grant from the Commonwealth. He said:</para><quote><para>Yes, this reflects that the `loan' is interest free and that the Commonwealth will provide a grant in 2001-02 to cover the cost of repaying the `loan'. The state budget treatment is considered to be consistent with the relevant accounting standards and is supported by the Auditor-General. Victoria's budget, handed down on 2 May, also treats this payment as a grant. It is understood that other states will do likewise.</para></quote><para>The Commonwealth Deputy Auditor-General also doubts the way the Treasurer classified the GST top-up money. In estimates on 24 May he said, in relation to the treatment of the GST top-up by the state Auditors-General:</para><quote><para>Certainly I could venture to say their views were based on the accounting standards. There is no question about that. </para></quote><para>Later, Mr McPhee said that he agreed with the compelling nature of the views of the state Auditors-General. What the Auditor-General does is look at the economic substance of the transaction. He is not interested in the flim-flam that the government supplying the accounts wants to put up; he actually looks at the economic substance. It does not matter if you disguise it, if you call it black when it is white, the Auditor-General's role is to see through that deception and account for it in its true and proper method. So scam 2 was exposed. I expect that the Auditor-General will, like last year, have to qualify the accounts of the governments. So this will be the second year in a row that this government has actually had the whistle blown on it by its own Auditor-General for its shonky accounting practices. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—It is no surprise to see the Democrats laughing at this sorry situation. It is no surprise at all. The third scam is the treatment of the dividends the government received from the Reserve Bank. Last financial year the RBA made billions of dollars in profits, most of which was passed to the government and accounted for in last year's budget. However, almost $700 million of the 1999-2000 Reserve Bank dividends have been shuffled into the 2000-01 financial year. Why has this been done? It is obvious: it is to make the books look better than they actually should. But when was the money received? Mr Battelino, an assistant governor at the Reserve Bank, was quite clear. He said at a committee hearing of the superannuation and financial services committee: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The rules there are very clear. All the profits of the bank each year, after allowing for any reserves the bank might need to top up to allow for contingencies, are passed over to the government ... Basically, we just distribute everything that we make every year.</para></quote><para>The Treasurer has been caught once again cooking the books. All of the three scams identified by Labor on budget night artificially boost the budget surplus. The budget bottom line is a $2.1 billion deficit. The budget surplus the government announced is a fake; they are in deficit.</para><para>We also should not forget that in 1997-98 the government projected a surplus for 2000-01 of $11 billion, an amount considerably larger than the $2.8 billion announced on budget night and the $2.1 billion deficit estimated by Labor. I ask the government: where has the budget surplus banished to? Further, this deterioration has occurred during a period of sustained economic growth. The structural budget which removes the influences of the business cycle is even worse. Access Economics has stated that the structural budget is in a deficit of $5.6 billion. The government have been caught talking tough on fiscal policy but have delivered a $2.1 billion deficit and a $5.6 billion structural deficit. This budget is all about the GST. The budget surplus has been squandered to bring in a GST. The government have made various claims in relation to the GST in this budget and, like so many other claims they have made about the GST, they are false. The GST is simple: false; the GST is fair: false; the GST is a state tax: false again, Mr Treasurer. </para><para>The Treasurer wants to have the Australian public think the GST is a state tax. I ask the government: why is the Treasurer denying the GST is his tax? Is he not proud of it? The GST is quite clearly a Commonwealth tax and should be classified as such in the budget. Once again, if it were needed, we have the proof. It is a tax imposed by the Commonwealth parliament; it is collected by the Australian Taxation Office, a Commonwealth government agency; and it is classified as a Commonwealth tax by none other than the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are not going to be in on this scam; they are not going to be in on this con; they have called a spade a spade. It is a Commonwealth tax. Mr Edwards, First Assistant Statistician, Economic Accounts Division of the ABS, quite clearly said at estimates last month:</para><quote><para>It is a Commonwealth tax as far as the ABS is concerned in our statistics.</para></quote><para>Why does the Treasurer not want to call the GST a Commonwealth tax? Because he wants to fiddle the figures to make them appear as though he is reducing tax. If the GST is not the Treasurer's tax but the states' tax, it will not show up in the Commonwealth revenues as a proportion of GDP. But it is a Commonwealth tax and, once the GST is included in the budget, it is quite clear that the Commonwealth tax take as a proportion of GDP is at record levels. Including the revenue from the GST, the Commonwealth tax take as a proportion of GDP is 23.6 per cent, and that makes Mr Costello the biggest taxing Treasurer in more than a decade.</para><para>Then there are the promised income tax cuts to compensate for the GST. This is the biggest con of them all. Figures in the budget make it quite clear that the government is grabbing them back. If interest rate increases have not already eaten your income tax cuts, the budget papers reveal that anything that is left will be clawed back after just one year. Labor revealed on budget night that the estimates of taxation revenue in the budget show that the government will recoup the income tax cuts after the first year. For the financial year 2000-01, the budget papers estimate that revenue from personal income tax falls by 10.2 per cent. But this is offset in the financial year 2001-02 when revenue from personal income tax rises by 10.9 per cent. And only two years after the introduction of the GST, Australian taxpayers will be paying $5.1 billion or around $600 per year more in income tax than they pay now. The income tax cuts are gone, but the GST is here forever.</para><para>Labor has not been alone in identifying this con. Professor Ann Harding has said that bracket creep will mean that the tax cuts due in July will be completely wiped out for average workers within three to four years. This government should come clean on the income tax cuts. The advertisements currently littering our TV screens and newspapers should be stopped. The government has hit the Australian people with a massive new tax, and the compensation will disappear all too quickly. The compensation is also not enough. Earlier this week, ACOSS released a study analysing the size of the tax cut. ACOSS concluded that households in the top 20 per cent income bracket will make substantial gains from the package, most middle income households will make more modest gains, while most low income households will tread water financially. The report further states: </para><quote><para>However, some low- and middle-income households will inevitably be worse off. ... In effect, $6 billion more is raised each year from regressive taxes on consumption to pay for income tax cuts for high-income households.</para></quote><para>Let us ask the actors on the GST ads what do they think now? Are they still feeling comfortable? Do they still want to give it a go?</para><para>These bills reveal other inaccuracies associated with the GST. As was revealed on Tuesday by Mr Hockey, petrol companies do not have to pass on anticipated cost savings. The implication of this is clear: the government will not be able to keep its promise that petrol prices will not rise after the GST. Mr Howard has broken his promise, made in April this year, that the price of petrol will not rise as a result of the GST. Mr Costello has broken his promise, made in 1998, that the new tax system would not lead to any increase in petrol prices. This was always an obvious result.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—You've convinced me.

There is no legislative power to require companies to pass on anticipated cost savings; there is no legislative power to require businesses to suffer losses until cost savings are realised. However, the government has extracted anticipated cost savings from its own departments. These departments have now found that their budget has been cut with the mantra that cost savings will result from the implementation of the GST. However, those departments know that those savings will not be realised immediately. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in reply to a question taken on notice at estimates in May, stated:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The ABS Budget was cut by 1% in the 2000-2001 budget round ($2.6m, $3.5m and $2.4m in 2000-01, 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively.) This was in anticipation of savings which the agency was expected to achieve as a result of the net effect of the new taxation arrangements on the prices of the goods and services it purchases. The anticipated price changes and associated savings, represent the net flow-on effects of the introduction of a broad goods and services tax and elimination of pre-existing wholesale sales tax. Savings are therefore likely to occur gradually after the introduction of the new tax arrangements.</para></quote><para>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the same. Mr Cameron, Chairman of ASIC, was very clear. He said:</para><quote><para>What is true is that there is a reduction of around $2.3 million in the appropriation this year which is due to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. It is a projected reduction which has been applied uniformly across agencies that presently pay sales tax ... It is supposed to reflect the lesser amount we will need to spend ... It was a calculated amount for the commission, based on the projection of what would <inline font-weight="bold">eventually</inline> be saved in the system by the abolition of wholesale sales tax.</para></quote><para>I ask the government: what will be the implications of these funding cuts for the delivery of services by those departments? Will the ABS be able to maintain its standing in the statistics community and continue to be ranked among the very best of statistical agencies in the world? Will ASIC be able to enforce the provisions of the Corporations Law, or will the corporate cowboys reign? This budget is about the GST and only about the GST. The government is pursuing the GST blind to the effects on small business, blind to the effects on consumers and blind to the effects on the delivery of government services. The latest Yellow Pages business survey shows that small business confidence has plunged dramatically to its lowest level since the recession. Small business cannot comprehend the GST—it is just too complex.</para><para>This budget fails to address the concerns of small business, and the cost will be lower growth. This budget will also deliver higher inflation. Despite its promise, we now know that, due to the GST, inflation will spike at 6.5 per cent in the September 2000 quarter. That is the government's forecast of inflation based on a set of very favourable assumptions—an inflation rate of 6.5 per cent. The bills today also reveal additional funding cuts to a number of government agencies. I will talk only about funding cuts to ASIC. My colleagues will be discussing other areas. In an internal memorandum after the budget was announced, ASIC stated that it must reduce its overall budget by about $7 million. That is a substantial cut to its funding. Within that reduced budget, ASIC must also provide for all newly emerging work, including that from law reform. These funding cuts follow what can only be described as a plea for help in ASIC's last annual report. The annual report stated: </para><quote><para>... we are under strain ... The increasing volume of our traditional work is outpacing our capacity to deliver. Our core funding has not increased ... we may now have too few staff on the ground to achieve the outcomes we and the government want.</para></quote><para>The government has responded to that plea for help by further cutting funding to ASIC. The government is so driven by the GST that it is willing to risk the confidence in and the integrity of Australia's financial markets. ASIC's internal memorandum states that, due to the funding cut, it will be discontinuing the regional small business program from 1 July 2000. This will cut about 40 staff positions. In a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 21 June 2000, the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia expressed its concern about any cuts to the small business program. The letter stated:</para><quote><para>As a result, more directors of small companies will be encouraged to avoid the provisions of the Corporations Law and the level of malfeasance, fraud, fraudulent gifting and insolvent trading will increase to the detriment of creditors and consumers, and ultimately to the detriment of the economy.</para></quote><para>The Chairman of ASIC has also admitted that ASIC will not be able to prosecute all the cases of corporate fraud and malfeasance that they should. He said:</para><quote><para>We may prosecute fewer cases, especially smaller cases ... it simply is unreasonable of the commission to expect a smaller number of people to deal with the same number of cases so we will deal more selectively ...</para></quote><para>The message here is simple: commit only a little bit of fraud or a little bit of corporate crime and ASIC will turn a blind eye—not because it wants to but because the government has denied it the necessary funds in order to introduce the government's GST. This obvious truth is also acknowledged in the internal memo from ASIC discussing the budget cuts. It states:</para><quote><para>... small business operators must adjust to a new tax system. They will face many new compliance pressures, and there is a reasonable case for us to ease back, at least in the coming year.</para></quote><para>But let me mention one department which will not be having its funds cut but will be receiving a large boost in funding. The ACCC is receiving an extra $20 million for the administration of the Trade Practices Act, the Prices Surveillance Act and related law. Why? There is only one reason—the GST. This is a budget to drive home the GST. Despite what the Treasurer may say, this budget has at its heart and soul the GST. This budget is based on accounting scams and bottom line deceptions to hide the truth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16117</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="R1074">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2000-2001</inline> and associated bills, I would like to begin by focusing on two areas of appropriations in particular: that relating to employment assistance under the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio outcome 1 category, and that relating to the Family and Community Services portfolio outcome 1, the delivery of Commonwealth services to eligible customers. The actions of the government's Centrelink agency have this week been called into question after an internal directive to Sydney employees of that organisation came to light. This directive seeks to implement a measure that is tacky and harsh, even by this government's standards. Indeed, when the Minister for Employment Services, Mr Tony Abbott, is moved to distance himself from a compliance measure, you can be sure that it is abnormally unfair. I refer to reports in the media this week of a directive issued by Centrelink to its employees titled `Now or never' in which employees are instructed to tell job seekers that, if they do not find work in Sydney this year, they never will. </para></talk.start><para>We are used to a punitive approach being adopted with the handling of job seekers in this nation, and the Democrats believe that job seekers are harshly treated and often vilified by this government, a government which continues to introduce inappropriate measures, such as the preparing for work agreement, which recently came into effect. But what this directive makes clear is that the concept of mutual obligation is utterly obsolete as far as this government is concerned. There is no mutuality in this sort of approach. This document actually contains the extraordinary instruction:</para><quote><para>Tell marginalised jobseekers: If you can't get a job in 2000 in Sydney, you'll never be able to get one. You are not serious about getting a job.</para></quote><para>The economic boom in Sydney has been evident for some months now and is certainly driven by the Olympics. I think that is broadly acknowledged. Whether it will continue after the athletes head home is a matter of debate.</para><para>The decline in unemployment in Sydney is partially due to this job creation, but that is only half the story. The other is the job readiness of job seekers in the Sydney labour market. There is no doubt that most of the job ready have found work. The Sydney unemployment rate is down to 5.5 per cent from 6.1 per cent since March last year. This is the clearest evidence that those who can find work indeed have. Unlike other Australian cities, Sydney has a labour market which is performing very well, but it has a long-term unemployment rate which is actually higher than the national average. The importance of this should not be underestimated.</para><para>What kind of people might not be finding work? Who are these marginalised job seekers who are so hopeless that they cannot find work in the middle of Sydney's jobs boom? A classic example would be, say, a 48-year-old white-collar worker who has worked at the same location for some years but whose employment was renegotiated a couple of years ago and who has been working on a contract basis since. At the end of the last term of contract, it was not renewed. So they look for work for a number of months without success, running down their savings to the point where they qualify for Newstart. They walk into their local Sydney Centrelink, where they will now be presented with a preparing for work agreement, which tells them all the penalties they are liable for and the myriad ways they can be found in breach. They are warned that they must turn up for every meeting that Centrelink requests.</para><para>Because they are under 50, they do not qualify for the reduced reporting, so they must fill in a dole diary and, because they are in Sydney, this means applying for 10 jobs per fortnight. They are directed to the Australian job search terminal in the Centrelink office as a good place to start looking for jobs in the Sydney area—and surrounding areas, because they have to be prepared to travel for an hour and a half for work. But it is all academic because, although there were 1,026 new jobs listed in the Sydney metropolitan area yesterday, most were for jobs like bar staff, call centre workers, receptionists or apprentices, and a 48-year-old former white-collar worker is not necessarily the ideal candidate for this type of work.</para><para>But they persist. They put in their 10 applications per fortnight without success. If they qualify for intensive assistance when they walk through the door, they are given five days to find a Job Network agency—completely undermining the government's farcical claims that user choice governs this system—which will hopefully give them support and some training while they are looking for work. Even with a call centre training course or computer skills training, it is hard to compete with many of the younger job seekers flooding into the Sydney labour market, which has a participation rate which has increased by 0.3 per cent since March last year.</para><para>They may be someone with learning difficulties, English may be their second language or maybe they have a mental illness—in other words, most of the people who cannot find work in Sydney generally have a good reason which qualifies them for intensive assistance. Job Network agencies have their own strong incentives for finding jobs for their intensive assistance candidates, with funding being redirected towards the Work for the Dole scheme. But eligible candidates continuing to present themselves and the up-front payments that these agencies receive when a candidate signs on are not enough to keep the business viable, and this is the debate we have had over the last couple of years in relation to the funding of the Job Network agencies. </para><para>I have pointed out many times in this place the redistribution of payments in the second Job Network tender round, decreasing the up-front payments to agencies and making their provision of assistance viable only if they get an outcome—in other words, if the person stays in work for 26 weeks. How Centrelink can maintain that job seekers, who must apply for 10 jobs a fortnight and submit to regular evaluations by Centrelink, are not being pressured into actually seeking work is beyond me. They may be fulfilling all of those things and yet there is the suggestion—as a consequence of this directive—that, if they cannot find work, it is their fault and they are not really looking for it. That is what that memo suggests.</para><para>The government has introduced the most stringent job search requirements, in conjunction with cuts to income support, in Australia's history—the worst ever. As a consequence, we were last week downgraded by the International Labour Organisation from a country that treats its citizens well to the middle rung of countries, behind most of continental Europe. The Centrelink document to which I referred earlier is evidence of the mania which pervades Centrelink for hounding, vilifying and breaching job seekers. I do not underestimate the level of pressure that Centrelink staff are under.</para><para>Rather than the agency responsible for providing job search support and information to unemployed people, there is no doubt that Centrelink is being used to raise funds from job seekers through fines which are proportionately higher than for many criminal offences in this country and to implement a mutual obligation regime aimed at reinforcing downward envy and the negative stereotypes of job seekers. These are reinforced on a regular basis with `dob in a dole bludger' and dole bludging stereotypes. A report released this week by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum—to which I referred on Monday evening—which is a comparison between mutual obligation schemes in the UK and Australia, noted:</para><quote><para>What is notable about the operation of Australia's mutual obligation arrangements is the emphasis on requirements or obligations without any strong focus on the purpose for so doing. Mutual obligation arrangements in Australia appear to be primarily a set of administrative hurdles presented to the job seekers to test their good faith in seeking work.</para></quote><para>This echoes the criticisms of mutual obligation, and the Work for the Dole program in particular, that were made by the OECD last year. The federal government must bear responsibility for the climate of job seeker vilification now endemic in the community and within certain sections of Centrelink. Instead of a mutual obligation relationship based on trust and goodwill, with the community and government offering support, training and assistance to job seekers to help them become job ready and able to take up employment opportunities fostered by good industry and economic policy, we have this cruel perversion.</para><para>Job seekers are subjected to ever more stringent testing of their commitment to finding work. The government refuses to develop industry and economic policy to create employment and, across the nation, those people unable to find work or unable to take it up are scapegoated. Coming a week after the claims of the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, that unemployment has the potential to cause social unrest among disaffected job seekers, the leaked Centrelink directive should serve as a timely warning to the government that its negative stereotyping of job seekers has gone too far.</para><para>In the remaining time, I would like to refer to another part of the appropriations bills. It deals with the appropriations for the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. I note that, within the bill, there is provision for:</para><quote><para>Australia's national interests promoted and advanced through contributions to international security, national economic and trade performance and trade cooperation. </para></quote><para>It also provides for the Australian Agency for International Development, stating:</para><quote><para>Australia's national interest advanced by assistance to developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development.</para></quote><para>It also provides for the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and the Australian Trade Commission. In light of the approach of the two old parties to trade, it is questionable whether these outcomes are being achieved at present. The outcomes in relation to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research are described as:</para><quote><para>International agricultural research partnerships that reduce poverty, improve food security and sustainably manage natural resources in developing countries and Australia.</para></quote><para>The outcome described in relation to the Australian Trade Commission is:</para><quote><para>Public understanding of Australia's trade and investment direction, Government export programmes and promotion of Australia's image internationally.</para></quote><para>We could all question whether those outcomes are being met and whether they have any better chance of being implemented under a Labor government. This week, the ACTU supported a proposal that governments be lobbied to include internationally recognised labour standards in future trade negotiations. It is a measure of the paranoia regarding trade policy, perhaps on both sides, and often the inability of our media to engage in a mature, considered debate over trade policy that this was immediately denounced as a return to the dark days of protectionism. </para><para>Given the mildness of the proposal, the same as that advocated by US President Bill Clinton and by the UK at the Seattle WTO meeting and practised by the EU for some years now, this knee-jerk reaction is somewhat perplexing. It is especially puzzling given the widespread public scepticism towards the haste with which Australia embraced free trade. Under Labor, Australia dismantled its trade barriers at a faster rate than any other nation, without demanding matching commitments to free trade by our trading partners. And we continue to do so under this government, to the extent that our Ambassador to the United States was moved earlier this week to express his frustration at the continuing international inequities. </para><para>So many jobs have been lost it is no wonder that the Australian trade union movement, representative of so many workers, is calling for a pause. It is one thing to lose jobs because our industries are uncompetitive or inefficient; it is quite another to see industry and investment move offshore because workers in other nations may be exploited and maltreated. Australia is the proud signatory to a number of international standards of human rights, and these necessarily include workers rights. Why should we not stand up for them? Why should we let other nations advance themselves on the basis of their continued exploitation of workers and, in some cases, children? Other Western nations have recognised that certain standards must be upheld, even if this gives rise to claims that non-tariff barriers are being imposed. </para><para>If, as the argument goes, free trade must be entered into so that developing nations may undergo their own industrial revolutions, why has there been so little economic progress in those nations over the past decades? If our arguments for opening up trade relations with hitherto abhorred regimes have been on the basis of so-called constructive engagement, why do we now refuse to engage in matters other than trade? Why are we so fearful of actually enforcing the very human rights and labour standards we committed ourselves to upholding? I fail to see how nations with little else but their natural resources and cheap labour to exploit will have any real democratic process unless the stakes are raised—even slightly. </para><para>Globalisation is indeed generating wealth, but this growth is merely exacerbating the divide between rich and poor in developed and developing nations alike. For the past decade, the free trade agenda has championed the opening of developing markets to foreign imports, arguing that the corresponding access to developed markets would more than balance the profits that Western corporations stood to make. This manifestly has not eventuated. Instead of peasant farmers finding themselves able to market their produce to, say, urban yuppies in Western societies, they have not been able to overcome the hurdle of competing against imports flooding their own domestic markets. Multinational corporations take over land, forcing traditional farmers off—poverty and malnutrition result.  </para><para>Bangladesh was cited at Seattle as a global free trade success story, but the figures tell a very different story. According to this argument, average annual growth of 3.5 per cent, up from two per cent in 1985, is evidence of the increased prosperity that globalisation has brought. Of course, this ignores the growing poverty on the land. In Africa, as another example, income per person grew by a third between 1960 and 1980 but fell by a quarter in the succeeding decades as liberalised trade and investment grew. In Latin America, income per capita grew by 73 per cent between 1960 and 1980, and then by less than six per cent between 1980 and 1997. Only some Asian countries have been able to reduce poverty levels, although this has been largely due to their extensive use of trade restrictions and government economic intervention. </para><para>A World Bank paper entitled `The simultaneous evolution of growth and inequality' by Lundberg and Squire showed that a greater openness to trade is `correlated negatively' with income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population but `strongly and positively' with income growth among the remaining 60 per cent. These researchers sampled 38 countries between 1965 and 1992 and found that the costs of adjusting to free trade are borne exclusively by the poor, regardless of how long that adjustment takes. </para><para>I think the issue of fair versus free trade is a timely debate. It is one that I look forward to having in this place. Certainly, it is one that we all look forward to reviewing perhaps at one of the political party conferences over the next few months. I am sure it will be a matter of controversy but I hope it will be a matter of good outcomes as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>16121</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator

awake.</para><para>Mr Cameron said: "Today the issue of petrol prices is on the political agenda big time."</para><para>He said the issue of petrol prices is much stronger in regional areas.</para><para>And he said for Australians petrol for their motor cars is regarded as one of the essentials of life.</para><para>Rod Cameron has a well earnt reputation for being deadly accurate and his view on attitudes to increases in petrol are no exception.</para><para>Since Rod Cameron delivered that speech Australians have increasingly turned their attention to the GST and how it will impact on their daily life.</para><para>They have also turned their attention to the promises the Prime Minister made to them about the impact of this new tax on everything.</para><para>One of those key promises related to petrol.</para><para>Mr Howard promised everyone petrol prices would not increase as a result of the GST.</para><para>It is now clear that he cannot deliver on that core promise and he is trying-unsuccessfully-to transfer responsibility for his failure to the oil companies.</para><para>The National Farmers Federation has always been a strong supporter of this Government and its tax agenda.</para><para>The close relationship between the NFF and the Howard Government is best illustrated by its decision to assist the Government on its ideologically driven campaign to smash the Maritime Union of Australia.</para><para>I would be interested to know what the benefits to farmers from the Dubai fiasco have been to date.</para><para>After all, the farmers own money was used by the NFF in that exercise.</para><para>Based on the latest government data productivity on the docks has fallen and the reliability of shipping services has deteriorated over the last six months.</para><para>Freight rates have also increased.</para><para>Based on that data-official government data-farmers are now worse off, not better off. </para><para>Thank you NFF. </para><para>As I said the NFF backed this tax package.</para><para>It argued about some of the detail but it locked in behind the Government on tax just as it locked in behind the campaign to smash the

fuel?</para><para>And the NFF answer is "No".</para><para>This is not correct.</para><para>Just as farmers were misled by the NFF about the campaign against the MUA on the Australian waterfront they have also been misled on what will happen to petrol prices after 1 July.</para><para>However, in relation to petrol prices it appears that the NFF itself-like many other industry organisations-was also misled by the Howard Government.</para><para>The President of the National Farmers Federation, Ian Donges, is now trying-belatedly-to force the Government to honour its promise that the introduction of the GST would not force petrol prices up.</para><para>Mr Donges was reported in the press as saying-"The bottom line is that it's the Government's responsibility to ensure that the cost savings achieved by the oil industry, and the excise reduction, will transfer into no price increase."</para><para>Mr Donges is wasting his time because while he was calling on the Government to honour this key promise to Australian farmers and everyone else the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey was all but conceding petrol price rises.</para><para>This is what the Minister said, "If the ACCC comes to the conclusion that petrol prices are not unreasonable or petrol companies are not exploiting consumers, then that is totally appropriate."</para><para>And if you go to the ACCC Price Guide you will find it shows no increase at all for petrol.</para><para>And the reason given by Professor Fels was that he expected the Howard Government to keep its

is very much the Prime Minister's own work-this commitment was his commitment.</para><para>And this broken promise is his broken promise.</para><para>But there is another very guilty party in all of this and that is the National Party.</para><para>The record of the National Party in the Howard Government has been nothing short of a disaster starting with the 1996 budget which saw key program

don't have to take my word for that.</para><para>You can go to the former Senator Bill O'Chee for confirmation of what I am saying.</para><para>In March last year Mr O'Chee told ABC radio that the National Party would recover from the political hiding it had just suffered in NSW.</para><para>He said the National Party would recover from that election debacle because the National Party was the only party that could deliver to regional Australia.</para><para>He said-"that is why we will be as indispensable in the future as we have been in the past."</para><para>As I have said in this place before it seems to me that at the point when a politician-or a political party for that matter-decides that he or she is indispensable, they are exactly the opposite.</para><para>The National Party has been in decline for some time but is failure to protect the bush from the worst excesses of the Howard/Costello city centric approach to Government has hastened that process.</para><para>Senators would recall that it was forced to close down its newly constructed national headquarters in Canberra-Sir John McEwen House-only one year to the day after it was opened by Sir John's widow Mary on 8 November 1996.</para><para>And the Party's five Canberra based staff were given notice to quit.</para><para>That occurred in part because financial support for the party was collapsing.</para><para>And things have deteriorated since then.</para><para>But the failure of the National Party members of the Howard Ministry to ensure that there would not be an increase in petrol prices in regional Australia as a result of the GST is by far its worst mistake.</para><para>As I said earlier Rod Cameron told the motor and petrol industry in March for Australians-particularly Australians living outside the big cities-petrol for their motor vehicle is considered to be one of the essentials of life.</para><para>The GST on petrol-and everything else

on the package of appropriation bills to address several issues in relation to health matters. I start off by first of all being critical of the ministers for health in relation to good governance. Recently the estimates report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee was handed down. That was very critical of the ministers for their lack of timely replies to questions placed on notice. This was a unanimous report by the committee. The only reason we received a number of the answers on the day of the estimates hearing was that the chair of the committee went around to the ministers' offices and threw a wobbly, to put it mildly—basically informed them that they were not doing the right thing. </para></talk.start><para>It is interesting to note that one of those ministers is the Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bishop. Some of us who have been here in the Senate for a number of years have very vivid recollections of Minister Bishop as a senator being very strong in estimates about good governance and getting answers. Maybe it is about time Minister Bishop read some of the questions and some of the comments that she made about good governance, accountability and answering questions when she was in the Senate and had a think about what she is doing now. Her behaviour in not encouraging her office to respond and to action the answers that are coming from the department pretty much on time—just leaving them there to rot or having pups in her office deal with them at their whim when they feel like it and not getting them ticked off when they come back from the department—is the sort of thing for which she would have kept a committee sitting until 4 o'clock in the morning through her questioning.</para><para>I think it is very remiss of Minister Bishop to have forgotten her behaviour when treatment that was far less severe was given to her. I urge the minister to remember her performances in here when she was an opposition senator and the priority that she now appears not to place on giving answers to this place. She has obviously forgotten the role, the power and the importance of the Senate. On occasions, I think some committee members feel that we are almost being treated with contempt and our right to have an answer to a reasonable question is being ignored.</para><para>In the budget we saw many words written about the shortage of doctors and what this government is going to do to overcome the shortage. The issue within the health system that is far more grave than the shortages of doctors is the shortage of other health professionals, particularly registered nurses. An article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Western Advocate, </inline>the paper in Bathurst, reported on a visit yesterday by the state Minister for Health and representatives of the nurses association. They are on a campaign to recruit more nurses. The minister is quoted as saying that there are 5,000 nursing vacancies in Australia and 1,300 nursing vacancies in New South Wales. Those vacancies need to be filled now and in the long term. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>There are many reasons for these vacancies including competing career decisions, HECS charges, reductions in places in universities and the old-fashioned perception of nursing.</para></quote><para>The minister states further:</para><quote><para>The NSW Government is actively pursuing nursing workforce issues including education and training and HECS fees. </para></quote><para>The New South Wales government provides well over 100 scholarships to the value of $630,000, especially to high school and mature aged students from rural areas. It is this Commonwealth government that has the funds for higher education. If the places are being cut, the Commonwealth government has to answer to that. It has put in place incentive schemes which pay the HECS for doctors undertaking medical training at university. It seriously has to look at what it is going to do to encourage more people to train as nurses. In rural areas, there are huge shortages in physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, podiatrists, counsellors, social workers—you name it, any health professional.</para><para>Whilst it is fine for the federal government to say, `Oh, we're worried about the shortage of doctors, we'll do something about it,' they also have a responsibility to make sure that an adequate number of people are being trained in the other health professions. A good health system does not just mean acute hospital beds and doctors. Good health systems run with multidisciplinery teams, with a range and variety of services and certainly adequate acute beds and adequate theatre places. But you need rehabilitation places, counselling services and a whole range of community services.  </para><para>Many people do not need to have their health care needs met by being admitted to an acute public hospital or even an acute private hospital. That is the most expensive option. This government dismisses at estimates that it has any major role in solving the health professional shortages in any profession other than doctors. I say to this government that it is going to have to rethink this position and address the issue because the shortage of health professionals, not just doctors, is one that we all have to face. There is no point in the six states and two territories busily addressing the system and reinventing the wheel six or eight times. If you actually have work force committees and attack the issue from a national level, you can pool all the resources and come up with better programs and outcomes.</para><para>This has been an issue in the ACT of recent times. Nurses have been complaining in the media about how often they are required to work double shifts. This is all due to the shortage of staff. This shortage of staff resulting in people working double shifts in areas that are quite stressful must have a deleterious effect upon the standard of care that they are giving and that they want to give. Certainly that is the case from my recent experience for people in nursing homes. This is due to the changes to aged care that this government has introduced. The pressures and workload on the nursing and the assistant nursing staff have increased immensely and they are not able to give the care that they wish to give. It is very important that this government actually starts to address this issue and not dismiss it as one for the states alone. If we are going to have a decent health system in the future, we have to have adequately trained health professionals in all professional groupings, not just doctors.</para><para>Here we have another issue in the health sphere. I quote here from an article appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline>, a Tamworth newspaper. A Mr Barry Bryan from Murrurundi who is keen to establish a new lymphoedema support group prompted this article. He and others are very concerned that:</para><quote><para>... private health funds are introducing policies to prevent sufferers gaining adequate access to treatment.</para></quote><para>As I have said, Mr Bryan comes from Murrurundi, but I have also received complaints about this from the south-east area of New South Wales. Mr Bryan has been a member of MBF for several years. The article states:</para><quote><para>At present, only a few NSW hospitals have specialised lymphoedema treatment programs and they are all based in Sydney. Despite having to travel for treatment, Mr Bryan has always been fully covered by MBF for his lengthy hospital stays.</para><para>However, in a tender currently being presented to hospitals, MBF has proposed to offer coverage for only ten initial treatment sessions and five sessions for every calendar year afterwards. Mr Bryan says this is not enough.</para></quote><para>The article then records Mr Bryan as stating:</para><quote><para>I'm a patient at Mount Wilga Private Hospital in Hornsby, and the initial treatment for just one limb there takes a month of daily therapy sessions. The new policy only covers one third of that ...</para></quote><para>He is very critical of that. Lymphoedema, I should add, is a debilitating condition that occurs when lymph nodes are removed, damaged or become defective. The lymphatic system is the drainage system around the body, and its fluid protects the body from infections. But, without the nodes, the fluid builds up in the body causing pain, bloating and eruptions. It is often associated with women who have had a mastectomy if they have had the lymph glands removed from under their arms; they may well have lymphoedema of an arm and require treatment. There is no cure but, with early intervention, the effects of the disease can be decreased. But this is a flow-on from the government's health policies. I have grave concerns about this government and its health policies.</para><para>That leads me on to the issue of Medicare and bulkbilling. Increasingly I am getting reports from around this state of doctors not bulkbilling, or choosing to bulkbill only some of their patients—and then only some of their pensioner patients. It used to be that most doctors bulkbilled all of their pensioners and health card recipients. But these days, in a number of places around the Canberra area and in the southern health region of New South Wales, numbers of doctors' practices in towns are choosing to bulkbill only some of their pensioner patients, not all. I have had complaints from Goulburn, I have had complaints from the South Coast around Moruya. </para><para>I have now had a complaint from the Riverina, in Wagga. There, an elderly person, a woman on an aged pension, required an ultrasound. She trotted along to have the ultrasound because her doctor had ordered it, and she was told that it would cost her $170 up-front. Why? Because of the government's changes to the rates of reimbursement on ultrasound, the Wagga Medical Imaging Centre—which is the name it trades under, but it is actually the Riverina Medical Imaging Group—has chosen not to bulkbill anybody for ultrasound. It is very worrying to see this erosion in bulkbilling occurring, with elderly people on limited incomes being asked to pay $170 before being able to have an investigation that their doctor has ordered which must be carried out before any treatment or further decisions can be made by their treating practitioners.</para><para>It is an issue of grave concern to me that this is beginning to happen. This government's lack of true commitment to bulkbilling and lack of true commitment to Medicare are obviously bringing this about. I put doctors on warning that I am going to start to get my office to undertake a ring-around and also consult with contacts and people in lots of areas of rural New South Wales just to see what is happening with this issue of who and who is not bulkbilling all of their pensioner patients. I think it is discriminatory if only some of a doctor's pensioner patients are going to be bulkbilled and others are not. It is almost as though they will choose who they want to give health care to and who they do not want to give health care to. I do not think in this day and age that is at all acceptable. I certainly put those in the medical profession on notice that, if they want to choose to be flash and fast with who they do and do not bulkbill, particularly if they have patients with pension cards, low income people, I for one will certainly be out here exposing them.</para><para>I have lived through the previous changes that a Liberal government made when there were two million people without any private health insurance, and the only way they could be bulkbilled was if they went and pleaded they were a disadvantaged case. I have cared for people under those circumstances where they had to humiliate themselves in going and telling the world that they were poor. I will never forget a family, a single-parent family with two children, where one child developed leukaemia. But the mother was hesitant to go and see the doctor about the child not being well, because she did not want to have to tell the world that she was poor. I rang the doctor's office and said, `Will you please bulkbill this particular person? She is too embarrassed to have to tell you that her financial situation is as it is.' She took the child in, and the child was diagnosed with leukaemia.</para><para>I do not want that sort of thing happening because doctors choose who they will and will not bulkbill when all or the majority of their patients are low income people. That is not fair. That is not the sort of health system I want to be associated with, and it is not the sort of Australia I want to live in. If doctors have a practice with a lot of pensioners and they are going to choose amongst them who they will and will not bulkbill, that smacks of elitism, total inequality and a lack of caring.</para><para>So I put on notice those GPs and doctors around the area who may choose to do that. There will be officers who will start investigating complaints and doing research to discover what the bulkbilling policies and attitudes are of the different practices in this half of New South Wales. If somebody is a pensioner, if somebody is on a low income, I believe that they deserve to be cared for as well as somebody the likes of Kerry Packer. Health care is something that should be delivered on need, not according to people's ability to pay. Health care to me is an inalienable right. If people are going to choose who they will and will not bulkbill, I certainly will be endeavouring to expose them. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>16126</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to return to a question I have raised on other occasions, and that is the issue of the virus plague of creepy-crawlies that are inhabiting cyberspace.

They are: Greenwich University, St Clements University, St George University International, the Australasian Institute, the University of Asia and the University of the Seven Rays.

Another university, according to the article, such as the Acton University, actually operates out of a prison cell in Texas. It has been able to manage to acquire some $460 million in just over a few years, which is money ripped away from people who thought they were actually receiving quality degrees.</para><para>In response to these issues that have been raised by the Labor Party in the Senate and by concerns expressed by others in the United States, the Commonwealth has been forced to announce the establishment, in cooperation with the United States of course, of a quality assurance agency and a quality assurance framework for higher education. This is designed, we are told, to protect and enhance our national investment in the higher education system. In my judgment, it comes not a moment too soon. The question, however, remains whether or not it can actually do the job that it claims to be doing.</para><para>The task before us of course is hard enough. It must bring together all the states and territories into a sound, common framework for accrediting new private providers in higher education and their courses, and then it must go and monitor them on an ongoing basis. The new agency must develop an agreed system of quality assurance that will be applied not just to these private providers but to the existing universities—institutions that are well used to looking after their own affairs in this regard. Universities are established by state and federal legislation as self-accrediting entities, and that task is difficult enough. The new quality assurance agency faces an even tougher challenge: it must, as a matter of urgency, devise a means of regulating and accrediting the virtual universities and other Internet providers now littering our higher education scene.</para><para>Things are happening too fast, it seems, for the Australian government to keep pace. A report of a survey on private higher education providers just released by the minister, Dr Kemp, indicates that there are now 31,000 students in private higher education in Australia—that is simply those in an accredited or regulated part of the sector. There are 86 such private providers. The report categorises them as the professional or industry associations, the theological colleges, the niche market operators and the private universities. These private providers, in response to the survey undertaken by this study, overwhelmingly cited the importance of state and territory accreditation procedures in enhancing their growth. They saw formal accreditation as critical in providing a prospectus for students with a guarantee of quality and standards. But if this guarantee is to have any real cash value, then the self-accreditation process must be rigorous. There must be consistency between the states and across the states. We see that this is just not happening. We have yet to see how the new Commonwealth-state quality assurance structure and agreement will in fact operate in practice. I am concerned to ensure that such an agreement will be robust enough to deliver this outcome. I want to emphasise that I support the notion of an Australian quality assurance framework. My concern is whether or not it is tough enough to protect the interests of our education industry as a whole. </para><para>A further major report was released by Dr Kemp recently. It was called <inline font-style="italic">The business of borderless education</inline>. It was produced by a group of researchers at the Queensland University of Technology who had been working on this project for about five years. They are to be congratulated for their far-reaching and valuable study. This report goes right to the cutting edge of higher education policy: to the boundaries between real space and cyberspace and to the interface between the corporate world and universities. The report highlights and documents the explosion in demand for knowledge and education on the one hand, and, on the other, the response to this explosion in the prolific expansion of technology based distance education and in corporate education provision. <inline font-style="italic">The business of borderless education</inline> report notes that, right now, there is not a flood of new higher education providers entering Australia. However, the situation could easily change, especially under a funding regime that allowed open competition for Commonwealth funds, such as that being toyed with by this government.</para><para>Corporate universities have been growing in recent times. We have seen this growth both in the public sector, through existing universities, and we have also seen this through the private sector. Not only are there many new private higher education providers of various kinds in Australia and overseas but also there are large corporate based business entities run through universities active in education provision. We have seen them in computing, accountancy, consulting and even in manufacturing and service industries. McDonald's Hamburger University in the United States is one of hundreds of examples of this type of phenomenon. A new corporate university now operating in Australia is the Oracle University. It is run by an IT company of the same name, and it provides courses relating to its own software products. The implication of these developments, in my judgment, are mind-boggling, and there is not time enough to go into them here.</para><para>Suffice it to say that it is appropriate for us to be looking at a quantum shift in the dissemination of knowledge and in education. There is indeed a massive leap occurring within the education sector of this country. But the physical and corporate locations of these proliferating entities create unprecedented challenges for those who are interested in education to come to terms with. It is happening in the context where there are huge cutbacks in the resources available through the Commonwealth and through the department, especially the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. That means that the traditional and basic functions are under considerable strain. I am yet to be convinced that this government has either the resolve or the capacity to show the leadership or the creativity to deal with this new situation. It is a serious problem when you have a government that is committed to the privatisation and deregulation of so much of government activity that, when it comes to deal with an issue such as the interface between the traditional university and the establishment of new corporate arms and of course new cyber entities, such as the degree mills I have spoken of, it is likely that the government is not able to meet the challenges that need to be confronted by its own policy directions. However, the quality assurance agency, I repeat, is a step in the right direction, but its powers and potential might be superseded even before it is actually set up. </para><para>Let me give a few examples of the creepy-crawlies in higher education that I have spoken of tonight. Internationally, the critical component in education is, I repeat, reputation for quality. That is what sets this country apart from the others with whom we compete. That is what we are selling on the open international market. My concern is that Australia is not doing enough to protect our reputation from corrosion by the infestation of these creepy-crawlies posing as universities. I do not mean to imply that all universities operating in cyberspace are somehow shonky or suspect. Clearly, that is not the case. After all, many of our most reputable and prestigious universities offer courses of study over the Internet and via distance education that involves electronic communication and computer packaged learning—and they have done so for a great length of time. Some institutions have shifted a large range of their distance education information services and activities to the Internet. This is not necessarily a problem, although it does raise some questions and some issues—about effectiveness and about quality of teaching in the new environment and about intellectual property.  </para><para>However, there are also those so-called providers of education about whom we are entitled to raise quite serious questions given the evidence that is now available. They are usually established in a formal sense offshore—in a tax haven on an island in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean or even the South Pacific. Nevertheless, they claim in some often ingenious way to be located, or to operate, in Australia. They do this in order to ride piggyback on our international reputation for quality that mainstream universities enjoy. Thus, you will see an Australian flag on their Internet home page or they will give a mailing address in Adelaide or in Darwin, as often as not a post office box. Some of them proclaim articulation or credit transfer arrangements with existing Australian universities. Yet, in a legal sense, it is doubtful that it can be established that they are carrying on a business or offering degree courses in Australia at all. They can always retreat at the first sign of trouble to their island refuge—the safe haven or the tax haven. </para><para>It is often asserted that, constitutionally, it is the role of the states to accredit and oversee the activities of educational institutions. This is a position, in my judgment, that is now arguable. There may be a place for much tougher national standards. A virtual university registered offshore can enrol Australian students while not technically operating in any Australian state or territory. The entire transaction can take place by remote control, as it were, from a distance. Australian companies law and trade practices legislation, for instance, probably do not apply to them. Therefore, they are entitled to make whatever claims they like, immune from the reach of Australian law and the protection that it provides for Australian citizens living in this country. They may claim to be an Australian university with the implication that they are of similar standing to existing Australian institutions. In doing so, they may easily mislead prospective students, wherever they may live—in Australia or elsewhere. In doing so, they immediately threaten the standing of existing, duly accredited and legislated instituted institutions.</para><para>The essential virtual provider that actually stepped through the net, as many senators I am sure would now be aware, is Greenwich University, which was legally established by enactment of a statute by the legislature of the Australian territory of Norfolk Island. This enabled those associated with Greenwich—this bogus outfit, as I see it—to claim with technical correctness that it is an Australian university. As the Greenwich web site asserts: </para><quote><para>Greenwich is an autonomous accredited university ... established on Norfolk Island under its own Act of parliament ... All degree programs are designed ... to fulfil Australian accreditation requirements. </para></quote><para>A big claim! This entity is currently the subject of an ad hoc inquiry being carried out jointly by the states and the Commonwealth. Its academic and financial bona fides are being examined. This arose only after the opposition had raised hell in this chamber and the estimates committees, concerning the operations of these particular people out there on Norfolk. I am told that the Duke of Brannagh who runs this crowd complains bitterly about the operations of the Labor Party and me in particular on these matters. I am looking forward to the Gallagher report on the activities of the duke, to establish whether or not he has fulfilled his obligations. The report from the committee is expected very soon. The Norfolk Island government has provided an undertaking to follow the recommendations of this report. We look forward to that report being handed down in this chamber. Australia's reputation may, in my judgment, well depend upon it.</para><para>The agreement between the states and the Commonwealth regarding the new quality assurance framework binds the states to periodic examination of the quality and standards obtaining in existing universities—those established under state law. But Norfolk Island, as an external territory of Australia, is not a member of the ministerial council, MCEETYA, under whose auspices agreement about the new quality assurance agency and processes has been reached: it is only an observer. I ask the question: will Norfolk Island in the future be bound by the quality assurance agreement? I trust that someone will be able to advise me. Will any new entity following the Greenwich example be covered by the new quality assurance agency, if it chooses to use Norfolk as its basis of operation? What about the next creepy-crawly entity that lobs on the rocks of Norfolk Island? What action will be taken to protect our reputation from such an invasion? Can we expect Norfolk Island to enact legislation setting up a robust accreditation agency to look at the credentials of would-be universities? Or could we face the prospect of our external territories—Christmas Island and the rest; perhaps even Antarctica—crawling with virtual entities claiming to be Australian universities: creatures from the deep, spreading their virtual tentacles around the world through cyberspace—I look forward to it!—pretending to be Australian universities, but outside the new quality assurance framework? </para><para>All this might sound a little far-fetched, but I assure the Senate that there are many creepy-crawlies out there and they are out there in very large numbers. For example, new to the Australian scene is the University of the Seven Rays. This weird and wonderful institution has been advertising seminars in three states: South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. It claims to have been offering a Master's degree in Esoteric Psychology in Adelaide for 10 years. The Australian Faculty Coordinator of the University of the Seven Rays is one Ms Eila Laurikainen. On her business card she describes herself as an `esoteric astrologer' who offers `psychospiritual counselling'. She is based in Adelaide, where she is involved, 1 believe, in organising `solar fire meditation meetings' at the time of the full moon. The university is also offering classes in `creative manifestation', which I understand is a type of magic. Senator Ellison might be very interested. Prominent in its courses is the idea of the seven rays or qualities: so you can study the `science of rayology', or you can study, if you so choose, through this entity esoteric science, between occult chemistry, cosmology or esoteric laws. Many of these courses are offered, we are told, at the master's level. The University of the Seven Rays is based on some odd beliefs. For instance, I quote from a paper from the university, `Education in the new millenium', placed prominently on the University's web site:</para><quote><para>The children of today and of the future do not need to be taught objective facts and information. Everything they need can be tapped into subjectively through morphic fields—collective unconscious, mass consciousness ...</para></quote><para>The author goes on to say that children will develop naturally, according to their personal blueprint, which can be discerned in part through their `natal chart'. The University of the Seven Rays is inspired and guided by `seed groups', including telepathic communicators and magnetic healers. Given that I see my time has almost expired, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>I understand that the Queensland Government, which takes seriously its responsibilities for the regulation of higher education, has warned this "University" that it must not offer degree courses in that State. It has told them to cease and desist from offering seminars linked to so-called Masters degrees in Queensland.</para><para>But in NSW and South Australia, the situation is quite different. In Sydney, it seems, the State contact for the new University is a staff member of the University of Sydney—you can contact her via the Sydney University email system. And in South Australia, the University of the Seven Rays seems well-established indeed.</para><para>The model for the Quality Assurance Agency adopted by the Government is essentially a States-rights model. It remains to be seen whether there remains in the patchwork of systems a capacity for the unscrupulous to jurisdiction-hop between States, as it suits. The new model must provide effective and timely protection from these practices. </para><para>The point here is a serious one indeed: is the new Quality Assurance structure up to dealing with entitles like the University of the Seven Rays?</para><para>In the Budget Estimates hearing, DETYA officers confirmed that, in order to put a stop to this entity's activities, separate action would have to be initiated in at least three States. And, despite all of the States having declared themselves ready and willing to clean up the shonky and questionable operators in higher education, this particular entity is operating with apparent impunity in two out of three States. So far, it appears that no action has been taken - and in one State, the provider claims to have been operating for ten years!</para><para>This is the State—South Australia—where another dodgy creepy-crawlie outfit, St Clements University, has hoodwinked the State Government into believing that it has upped and moved to the Northern Territory—while its mailing address remains in Adelaide: in a pub, just a couple of doors from the head office of the South Australian Department of Education itself.</para><para>If you remember, St Clements was the university that doubled as a whisky wholesaler's.</para><para>Darwin seems to be becoming a bit of a haven for odd Internet universities. The University of Asia has moved up there too. This is the company that has obtained registration by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), registered with the word "university" in its name contrary to ASIC's own regulations. Despite the fact that this "mistake" was drawn to the Government's attention in Estimates last year, nothing has been done to force this company to stop misleading the public and change its name. And several other apparent Internet universities have registered as well, with obvious impunity.</para><para>In Vocational Education. QA under the Mutual Recognition Framework is deeply flawed - on a legal, a practical, and an administrative basis. The next MINCO (Ministerial Council) meeting must come to terms with a number of issues that the Opposition has been pursuing both at Senate Estimates and also the Senate Inquiry into the Quality of Vocational Education.</para><para>I must ask, finally, this question—is there nothing that higher education can learn from the VET sector? Isn't it time for a national approach to both sectors, that is effective, and that can guarantee quality to all who wish to have access to Australian educational institutions?</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>16130</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in the debate on the <inline ref="R1074">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2000-2001</inline> and associated  bills. I have to say at the outset that, if my voice does not last the distance, I will be seeking to incorporate my speech into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Tonight I want to provide the chamber with a Northern Territory snapshot of what has happened in this year's budget. There is no good news in this budget and, in fact, this will be the first GST budget for Territorians. It fails to deliver improved services in areas such as jobs, education, health, remote infrastructure, road funding and, of course, fuel costs. It fails to compensate Territorians for the impact of the GST, and the so-called tax cuts will disappear in just one year. It also fails to give Territorians a secure knowledge that their education and health outcomes will improve.</para></talk.start><para>This is what we have been told we are going to get in the Northern Territory as a result of this budget: a new 500-bed immigration reception and processing centre in Darwin, $20 million over the next four years for mandatory sentencing purposes, and an extra $53 million for new defence initiatives and ATSIC. Let us go to mandatory sentencing. With a new detention centre in Darwin and an extra $20 million for the mandatory sentencing program, in the middle of the night we are probably going to have more people in detention than we have walking around the streets of Darwin! Building a detention centre in Darwin does not address the real issues facing Territorians.</para><para>During the last round of the Senate legal and constitutional estimates committee, we were told that the Attorney-General's Department have no idea what the $5 million mandatory sentencing package was based on. It seems that it was a deal that was cooked up in the dead of night in the Prime Minister's office. Senior departmental officials also told the committee that there was no intention or requirement by the federal government to consult with any of the stakeholders as to how the money would or should be spent, and that this was an optional requirement for the Northern Territory government. The only concrete proposal that the Northern Territory government has come up with is to fund 12 additional police officers—but somehow it seems that the Commonwealth government has denied agreeing to this! Both governments have a duty to involve all the stakeholders and to come up with some effective and appropriate diversionary programs and an Aboriginal interpreter service that meets the community's needs. It is not good enough to increase police numbers at the expense of community initiatives aimed at reducing crime rates and recidivism amongst young people. </para><para>We were told at estimates that there were three initiatives as a result of this deal: family conferencing, substance abuse and drug diversionary programs, and an Aboriginal interpreter service. The interpreter service proposed is going to be an expansion of the registrar that currently operates out of the Chief Minister's Department. That is not good enough. The federal government is giving the Northern Territory government $20 million over the next four years and it must ensure that it is spent appropriately and that the Northern Territory government is accountable for every single cent of this money.</para><para>I also reject the claims that the 2000-01 defence budget contained good news for the Territory. Defence Minister John Moore is misleading Territorians into believing the federal budget will deliver an extra $53 million. This is not true. The Northern Territory government knows this. In fact, the capital expenditure in the defence budget has been cut by more than $250 million from last year's original budget estimates. None of the projects listed by the minister are new projects. He is just playing with the figures so that Territorians will think the federal government is injecting a whole lot of new money into the Territory. There simply are not going to be any new capital projects in defence in the Territory, and the Northern Territory government would be better off telling Territorians the truth rather than perpetuating a myth on behalf of this federal government.</para><para>The government proposed to spend 86c per person on education. If you look at the way education expenses are spread across the length and breadth of the Territory, this is clearly a joke. The first GST budget has done nothing to address the parlous state of Australian universities, particularly the Northern Territory University, as described to cabinet by Minister Kemp last October. Once money targeted at rural health, financial assistance to children of farming and small business families and money to fill projected holes in forward estimates is excluded, there is only $4 million per annum in new money for universities. Although welcome, this money is both inadequate and narrowly targeted at large scale research infrastructure. It must also be placed in the context of a GST clawback of up to 3.5 per cent on research agencies. </para><para>This is the plan of a government which expects the business sector to provide new investment in research and development while capping its own. There is nothing in the budget to address escalating staff-student ratios, to fund costly information technology infrastructure or to meet the costs of enterprise bargaining. These are all critical issues identified by Dr Kemp in his cabinet submission of last year and have not been addressed in this year's budget. The complete absence of any attempt to address the overriding problems facing the university sector is one of the clearest policy messages the minister could send the sector. Dr Kemp has a plan all right—and it is to exacerbate the crisis described in his failed cabinet submission until he induces sufficient desperation to make his deregulatory policies politically palatable. </para><para>Irrespective of the efforts of the Prime Minister and Dr Kemp to distance themselves from the deregulatory proposals in the leaked cabinet submission, the policy is far from forgotten. Instead, it has been placed on hold pending the result of the next federal election. If the coalition is returned at next year's election, which we do not expect, of course, we would expect Kemp's plan to be resurrected. Until then the government will continue to set the scene by intentionally running down our university system. Cuts of $171 million to regional universities have placed many of them in danger, according to Dr Kemp. </para><para>In relation to the Northern Territory University, that is particularly so. His own cabinet submission claimed that already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk. In fact, we know that is the case in the Northern Territory because the Northern Territory government less than two months ago had to provide the Northern Territory University with $7 million to bail them out of the mess this federal government has got them into. The government's university cuts hit hardest in regional towns where the university is a key employer and provider of infrastructure as well as being a university and an educational institution.  </para><para>Last year's budget cut a further $40 million when it abolished the merit based equity scholarships, which were specifically designed to assist 1,000 disadvantaged students a year, including rural students, to attend a university. TAFE cuts of $240 million have also hit rural communities, despite the findings of the government-chaired committee. That said, TAFE plays an important role in the education, training and general life of regional communities. In these areas, a TAFE institute is more than just an educational institution. It provides a focal point for current technologies, philosophies and skills and contributes significantly to a region's social and economic growth.</para><para>The enrolment benchmark adjustment in schools will take $27.5 million from government schools this year. This includes rural schools, despite increasing enrolments. In four budgets so far the Howard government has cut $3 billion from education and inflicted a significant amount of this damage on rural education.</para><para>But in particular the federal government has dodged its responsibilities to the staff and students of the Northern Territory University and it has completely failed to acknowledge this university in regional Australia. The NTU has been facing a major funding crisis for a very long time. It has cut courses and staffing levels, and this has jeopardised the quality of education delivered to and received by Territorians who choose to stay in Darwin, who in fact want to stay in Darwin, to study rather than travel interstate to universities, which they are now in some cases being forced to do.</para><para>The education minister, Dr David Kemp, should hang his head in shame because he is directly responsible for the funding crisis at the Northern Territory University. In April this year, the Northern Territory government stepped in and announced it would boost funding to NTU by $7 million over the next three years. Dr Kemp's education policies of growth through efficiencies in TAFE and cuts to operational grants in higher education have seen massive funding and resources cuts to the university sector since 1996. The NTU has been doing it tough as a result of this federal government's policies. By 2001, the NTU's operational funding from the federal government will have dropped by almost $1.5 million since 1996. A comparison of the actual 1996 operation grants to the NTU with the 2001 estimates derived from the DETYA figures shows there is a 4.2 per cent difference. As a result, the funding burden faced by the Northern Territory University has been unfairly passed on to students, staff, courses and now the whole of the Northern Territory community. Territory taxpayers will now be forced to pick up the bill for the federal government's lack of commitment to regional development through the provision of essential skills and knowledge. </para><para>In particular tonight I want to turn to the issue of fuel costs in the Northern Territory. The silence was deafening from the federal government when the Northern Territory government announced in its budget in May that it would scrap its 1.1c fuel subsidy from 1 July because of the GST saving of $7 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Great policy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—But, as soon as Queensland said it would scrap its fuel subsidy, Senator McGauran, the National Party was very loud indeed in criticising the Queensland government, but there was not one word criticising the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory minister, Mike Reed, justified removing the subsidy by saying that the $7 million saved will go into IT programs for Territory schoolkids. Now we have the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, saying that the removal of the fuel subsidy is an unjustified financial windfall to the Northern Territory. He has written to the Northern Territory Chief Minister advising him, in fact, to reinstate the fuel subsidy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Northern Territory government has a responsibility to ensure that the subsidy is reinstated and, if it is appropriate, that they get the required funds for these other purposes to let them do their budget so that they get those results. It should not be penalising Northern Territory taxpayers, Northern Territory consumers and Northern Territory car drivers and car owners by removing this subsidy and piggybacking on the top of the GST. </para><para>Senator Tambling is the Deputy Leader of the National Party in this Senate, but we have not heard one squeak from him on the Northern Territory government's decision to axe its fuel subsidy, nor have we heard anything from Deputy Prime Minister and National Party leader, John Anderson. But John Anderson described Queensland's move as breathtaking opportunism and an attempt to shift the blame to Canberra, which will blow up in his face. But equally the same could be said of the Northern Territory government. Obviously it is okay for the Nationals to criticise Queensland, but they zip their lips when it comes to their conservative mates in the Northern Territory. If that is not political opportunism, then I do not know what is.</para><para>Fuel costs in the Northern Territory are going to rise on Saturday, despite the federal government's proposed GST fuel grants for the bush. People in rural and remote parts of the Territory will still be paying more for their fuel than the government claims they will be paying. We will be paying more for petrol than any other Australians, but it seems to be of no consequence at all to the Northern Territory Treasurer, to the Chief Minister, to Grant Tambling, to the National Party of this country, to John Anderson or indeed to the federal government. They have a way in which they can impact upon that, that is, by reinstating the subsidy of 1.1c a litre. We are waiting for the federal government to put extreme pressure on the Northern Territory government to do this.</para><para>With inflation expected to hit 6.75 per cent in the first quarter under the GST, you can guarantee that costs in the Northern Territory will skyrocket. We already pay more than any other place in this country for a basket of goods in our supermarket. The bottom line of the budget is that it is really a $2.1 billion deficit based on dodgy accounting and asset sales. All it delivers to Territory families is a GST that will stay with them forever, with no long-term compensation for living in rural and remote parts of this country.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Friday, 30 June 2000</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>16133</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Having conspired to inflict the GST on all Australians, the Liberal-National-Democrat coalition in their typical manner paid scant attention to the detail of the problems they were creating and professed that they had made the system fair through a range of convoluted compensation measures.

The effect on long-stay caravan park residents brought that home clearly, and time will show that the latest deal between the Democrats and the government will not address that inequity and unfairness.

This one is appropriately called GAS—the GST assistance scheme. It is appropriately called GAS because it is nothing more than hot air.

I would like to quote the response from Australia's peak welfare body, ACOSS.

There is the challenge thrown down by Minister Newman with that set of criteria.</para><para>When this was raised with me through my office in Brisbane in the last 24 hours, we started to search to try to find just who might be eligible. In spite of a far and wide search, we found that, when we started to get into the set of criteria that were there, there were few, if any, that we could find who would be eligible. Even then, the compensation that was being offered was tantamount to nothing indeed—$120. And remember that the GST will hit hardest the people on low incomes or fixed incomes or people who are self-funded retirees—people at the bottom of the income scale. So we have this scheme which attracted, as I have previously said, one line in the budget—and probably that is about all it deserved—and what do we find as a result of that one line? It should not have been there. We cannot find anyone eligible. One can only describe it at best as being a dubious sop—an unfortunate ploy—to the unfortunate people out there who think that there is some real compensation for them being offered by this government. </para><para>Last but not least—and I am aware of the fact that there are other speakers seeking to come after me—I just want to say a few words on the impact of the GST on some small business people. In particular, I want to refer to a recent newsletter that was sent home with my young daughter from her Irish dancing school. It is interesting to read this part of the newsletter on the GST. The dancing school proprietor, a single operator, not a very lavish operation, had this to say:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">G-S-T</inline>. After several discussions with my accountant, I will have to add on a 10% GST to all lessons from July 1st. If I don't add the GST on I will not be able to claim the GST on goods purchased. Every bill I pay in connection with dancing will have GST added. So I would either have had to increase fees to cover this or charge GST. An increase in fees would have put me over the threshold and I would have had to charge GST which would have been a double increase for everyone. I did not ever think when I started teaching Irish dancing that I would have become a tax collector as well.</para></quote><para>Two things stand out in this statement. Firstly, the lessons will go up by 10 per cent. This is not a massive business, a massive organisation. This is as much a community organisation, because I could not imagine a person making a fortune out of teaching young children Irish dancing. Yes, there is some money in it for them, but it is not a big money spinner. Here we have this person being faced with either increasing the fees or charging the GST. Of course, lo and behold, what did the proprietor of the dancing school say? `I am charging 10 per cent.' How often during question time and during other speeches in this place have we heard people say, `Oh, no, no, it won't go up by 10 per cent.' Here we have it in black and white once again.</para><para>The second issue is that this person realised that they had succumbed to being a tax collector, and that is something that they desperately wanted to avoid. There is no doubt in my mind that the GST will be of no benefit to people such as this small business operator. This undoubtedly will earn the wrath of this government with those small business operators. Likewise, there will be no benefit in the GST, as I have said, to low income, fixed income and single income families, just as it has been shown and will be shown to be a burden on small business. There is no doubt that the odium of this tax will remain with the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberal Party forever. They will have to wear the whole process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>16135</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to make a few comments tonight.

I want to mention a few matters of concern about the way senators are served in this place and how well we are served. I think that, because we are so well served, when the system falls down we certainly do come to notice. In the recent round of estimates committees the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee had cause to reflect on the considerable delays in production of the transcript of the proceedings of the estimates committee deliberations, and we have mentioned this in our report. Those delays had an impact later on a second matter that I want to address this morning. The committee report stated: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The record of proceedings for Wednesday 31 May was not available until Friday 9 June 2000. The Committee expresses its concern at what it considers to be an unsatisfactory service and trusts that it will not be repeated. The cause of the delay on this occasion should be investigated. </para></quote><para>At the time of including this matter in the report, we were aware—certainly I was aware—of some of the reasons why the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was not delivered to us. The Clerk Assistant, Mr Cleaver Elliott, has since drawn to my attention and the attention of the Deputy President the fact that, during that estimates week when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee met, four estimates committees, two bills committees, the House, the second chamber and the House committees also met. Mr Elliott, in an email message that was sent to the secretary of the committee and copied to the Deputy President, went on to say that he had met with all of the estimates team (the estimates officers, Hansard, SAVO, catering, et cetera) in the week before. He went on to say, `We all knew that upfront.' There is something missing because I, as a member of the committee and as deputy chairman of the committee, was not aware of this. I only became aware of this when I went looking for the service, as you normally do, as we check our pinks the next morning or expect speeches within an hour of delivery and we anticipate it. When you do not get this service you realise there is some problem, certainly if you have not been told before, as we were not told on this occasion. Mr Elliott said in his email:</para><quote><para>I have been advised by Hansard that the normal turnaround is of the order of 3 working days, to which a day and a half delay was proposed, that is just about to be met and if it is not, it would be about a day out of time—in the circumstances, a matter of commendation not brick-bats. </para></quote><para>I am not giving any brickbats. I am certainly not criticising the Hansard staff because they were working as Mr Elliott advises. He said:</para><quote><para>I have been advised that Hansard staff have worked from 8am till 11pm each week day for the last fortnight and from 4 to 8 hours each day for the last two weekends ...</para></quote><para>So we are aware of the problems and the pressures that they are under. He mentions three working days plus a day and a half spin-out, but that was not met. As the committee indicates in the report, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings for Wednesday 31 May was not available until Friday 9 June. That is more than three days plus a day and a half spin-out. This had some implications, which is the issue that I want to address now. On that Wednesday morning, the committee had the joy of meeting the Migration Agents Registration Authority for the first time in a Senate estimates committee hearing. The authority came into being on 23 March 1998 when the minister appointed the Migration Institute of Australia as the Migration Agents Registration Authority to administer the relevant provisions of the Migration Act 1958 and to undertake the role of regulator of the migration advice industry. The committee questioned MARA about their role and operations based on their annual report for 1999.</para><para>The committee were aware that on the previous evening the Joint Standing Committee on Migration had been inquiring into the migration amendment bill which proposes to limit the ability of certain persons with presumed migration claims to undertake class actions within the Federal Court or the High Court of Australia. A series of advertisements from lawyers and migration agents, which perhaps should have received the scrutiny of a regulatory authority such as MARA, had been brought to the committee's attention. Perhaps it could be considered an unseemly circumstance, but we were addressing questions to MARA, which then denied knowing about the existence of these advertisements. We had the departmental officers at the same table—a rather long table—saying that they had informed MARA that the advertisements had been brought to their attention. </para><para>Without delaying proceedings, the matters were taken on notice. On 6 June, three days before the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was available, the committee secretary received a note from Mr Ray Brown, the chairman of MARA, to which was attached a copy of a letter that Mr Brown had written to the secretary of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. In that letter, Mr Brown admitted that the advertisements had in fact been referred to them by the department. Mr Brown apologised to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration for `any misunderstanding'—they are his words—as to whether MARA had had this information. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Estimates Committee have not yet had a direct letter from Mr Brown, but it was his and MARA's first attendance at a Senate estimates committee hearing. I make mention of that fact because on the night of Tuesday 6 June the Joint Standing Committee on Migration were again meeting with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and progressing the matter of the reference to the bill that they had before them. </para><para>As a member of that committee, I was at somewhat of a disadvantage in attending that meeting and further questioning the department about the contents of the responses we received from the MARA at the Senate estimates committee. I did not have that information because the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> was not available to me. That was six days. That was the Tuesday after the previous Wednesday's hearing. You can see where we were disadvantaged.</para><para>The wonderful committee secretariat that we have in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee assisted on the occasion. They got a copy of the tape of proceedings. I apologise to those who watched those proceedings on that Wednesday morning because I was wearing that awful yellow shirt of mine, and I realise what others have to put up with when looking at the televisions when they are tuning in to the Senate estimates committee because it was reverberating on the screen every time the cameras turned to me. We did the best we could and took a transcript of the answers and replies that we got. When I arrived at the joint standing committee meeting at 8 p.m., we were given a copy of Mr Brown's letter. </para><para>The circumstances would not have existed had we not been so well served by Hansard in the past. We would not have run into those difficulties because we would have relied on our longhand notes. But one loses those skills when one gets the service that we have been so used to getting—and continue to get, I might add. I think the system has broken down. There are obviously reasons why the system broke down last time. Part of those reasons would be the fact that four estimates committees were meeting at the same time, as were two bill inquiries. I understand there was one committee that had an estimates committee proceedings going on and a bill inquiry and they got their <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> delivered in a timely fashion on both occasions. Both the estimates committee and the bill inquiry, as well as the House of Representatives, were sitting at the same time. It is of concern. It did not have dramatic effect. It caused me quite a deal of angst and quite a deal of extra time. It caused the committee secretariat quite a deal of extra work. We have recommended in the committee's unanimous report that the matter be investigated and steps be taken to ensure that those circumstances do not happen again.</para><para>To avert those circumstances occurring again, one would have to ensure that the number of committee meetings that are held when major estimates committees proceedings are being held—this was the budget estimates that we are talking about; some committees, I understand, went for five days—are limited during that period of time so that Hansard can continue to deliver the brilliant service that has been delivered to us in the past.</para><para>I want to wind up by saying a few words about days of glory—glory that was rather than glory that might have been. I am referring here to Perth Glory, a soccer club that almost won the league championship in the National Soccer League of Australia. The club topped that league at the end of the home and away competition and proceeded into the grand final for the first time—in only their fourth year of existence. It was their second time into the finals and they performed commendably well—a great tribute to Perth and to the supporters that follow them in Perth, which, through the actions of the Perth Glory, has now become the home of soccer in Australia. </para><para>Let me illustrate that to you. Perth Glory have regularly got an attendance of 14,000 at each home game at the Perth oval. I think the average is probably about 11,000 this year, but it can go up to 15,000 from time to time. No other club in Australia matches that. No club really comes near. I think 14,000 is the average and the next one is 11,000, and that is an eastern states club.</para><para>When the first semifinal was played at the Subiaco Oval on 27 May, a record attendance was reported of some 43,000 persons, including my wife and me and a number of my parliamentary colleagues, when Perth beat Wollongong Wolves by two goals to one. On 11 June that record crowd was repeated at the grand final, when the Glory again met Wollongong Wolves, and in the region of 43,000 people attended.  </para><para>During the time those two finals were being played, the Australian national side was playing three international matches in the major capital cities in the eastern part of Australia. Those cities are all more densely populated than Perth and the national side was attracting crowds in the region of 4,000 people. Ten times that number attended the recent finals in Perth, and regularly 14,000 people attend Perth Glory matches. Soccer Australia needs to take note of this and recognise where the soccer capital of Australia is. Perhaps they might think of sending an international game over to Perth sometime rather than holding it in Melbourne. They played the last game at Olympic Park after having had to transfer it from the infamous Docklands because there was something wrong with the pitch. Nonetheless, Soccer Australia obviously has an eastern states bent.</para><para>While I am on the anti eastern states scenario, on that day of the grand final Perth led three-nil at half-time. Wollongong Wolves brought the score to level pegging at full-time, and the score was still three-three after extra time. Then there was a penalty shoot-out, and records show that Perth lost on the penalty shoot-out. I did not appreciate some hours later, while listening in to <inline font-style="italic">Grandstand Wrap</inline> on ABC Radio in Perth and trying to get up to date with what had been happening in the Australian Football League, being given a blow-by-blow update of those penalties being taken in live transmission. The ABC had recorded their <inline font-style="italic">Grandstand Wrap </inline>for the eastern states and replayed it two hours later in Perth! When we had been so close to winning—we were up three-nil at half-time and lost on a penalty shoot-out—I really did not appreciate the ABC rubbing it in in that fashion. Perth Glory—the directors, the players and the coach—are to be commended for their magnificent effort on behalf of their spectators. They lost on the day but, by golly, they won throughout the season. Wollongong Wolves were deserving winners on the day. They played the game with great sportsmanship and they deserved to win because they are the ones who had the most goals at the end of the day. Incidentally, it is of note that there were more soccer goals scored at Subiaco Oval than goals scored by the West Coast Eagles the night before.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—Such a record must be worthy of an appropriation!</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16138</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to point out that this time next year we will have celebrated the Centenary of the Federation of Australia.

The Howard government has desperately been trying to argue the case, having been sprung spending some $431 million of taxpayers' money on political propaganda in promoting the goods and services tax.

We have got to examine the precedent that has now been set by the Howard government in relation to government advertising. We in the opposition believe that it is unconscionable to turn information and education campaigns into political propaganda campaigns, which of course is the way it has worked under this government.</para><para>We have to set the record straight in relation to some important principles that apply to government advertising. The first is that governments should be allowed to advertise. No-one argues with that. They should be able to promote programs in the media. They should be able to recruit members for the Australian Defence Force. We would argue that a government that did not engage in that sort of advertising would not be doing its job adequately. You cannot change laws to bring in new policies in a vacuum. People have to be informed. We acknowledge that. Not everyone reads the fine print in newspapers, as you would appreciate, Mr Acting Deputy President. Not everyone listens to or watches current affairs programs. Often you do not have these media outlets necessarily going into the fine print of every legislated program of government. Sometimes they even tend to get sidetracked, and sometimes you even have media outlets reporting political point scoring, as you would be aware. </para><para>But what is true is that governments have advertised their activities for many years. For the decade up until 1997 the Commonwealth spent an average of just over $3 million a month on advertising. An average of $13 million to $14 million a year was spent on Defence Force recruitment advertising. Other programs that have been advertised, as senators would understand, include public health campaigns, `Australian made' campaigns and the like. When the Hawke government was encouraging debate on the tax reforms of the mid-80s, the government then spent $2 million on newspaper advertisements, mail-outs and the rest. When Labor refurbished Australia's superannuation system, $15 million was spent from 1992 to 1995 to inform workers of their rights and responsibilities.</para><para>But what we have recently had is the Auditor-General's inquiry into the CEIP. That was the GST promotion campaign that was conducted in the run-up to the 1998 federal election. The Auditor-General published in his report a graph which shows an average of around $2 million a month in advertising from 1989 through to 1997, not including defence advertising. But right at the end of the graph that the Auditor-General prepared you have an unprecedented spike in 1998 in advertising expenditure. When was it? Of course, it was in the period of July-August 1998, just a few weeks prior to the 1998 federal election.</para><para>But the Howard government did not just blow $16 million on the disgraceful GST CEIP; in the preceding two months there was the $4 million spent on the Job Network campaign, there was $4.5 million on `what we've done for the youth of Australia' campaign, there was the $4.5 million for the Natural Heritage Trust campaign.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Very successful programs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That included a $77,000 research component, which was slung to Liberal pollster Mark Textor, if my memory serves me correctly, just prior to his task of polling for the Liberal Party in the 1998 campaign. There was $2.8 million for a social security fraud campaign telling us how many dole cheats had been caught by the current government using the data matching techniques that were introduced by the previous Labor government. So there was a three-month spend of $30 million, with the climax being the $16 million spent on the CEIP campaign on tax promotion just three weeks before Mr Howard drove to Yarralumla to ask the Governor-General to dissolve the parliament. They are the facts of the matter. I notice Senator Herron is reading the graph that I would like to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I will come back to that graph in a few minutes, but I now seek leave to have the graph incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><para>The graph read as follows— </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—As I said, a massive amount of public money was spent on promoting the Howard government prior to the 1998 federal election. I note that a prime ministerial spokesman—hopefully, not the one who organised the debacle at Murphy's wine bar this evening—tried to avoid criticism of the current chains campaign by stating in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> last Monday: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This advertising campaign relates to matters that have already been passed by parliament and are government policies.</para></quote><para>They are very interesting words from the Prime Minister's spokesman. Of course, this is an admission from the Prime Minister's office that the CEIP campaign was not based on legislation and was all about promoting the Liberal Party's taxation policy before it took that policy to the last election. So you had a massive spike in expenditure just prior to the last election on government advertising. It is more than just a blip; we have a real government scam on our hands here.</para><para>But I have to be fair and objective in my analysis of government advertising. The CEIP spike in expenditure is just a molehill compared with the Everest that we have had over the last few months. The $16 million CEIP campaign is, frankly, next to nothing when you compare it with the $431 million that the Howard government has spent recently on promoting the GST. That figure has been painstakingly established by the Labor opposition through our effective work in the Senate estimates committee and through our trawling of the departmental annual reports. We have been able to establish the figure of $431 million spent on GST advertising promotion and education.</para><para>What I have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is an updated graph that does not include the GST start-up unit. I would point out that a lot of corporations like Amway, Tupperware and these sorts of outfits tell anyone it is easy to sell something when it is being pitched by friends, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy President. So it is with the government giving GST funding to peak bodies and industry groups to sell the tax changes to their constituencies. GST start-up obviously has a direct promotional intent.</para><para>I accept that it is not purely advertising, but our calculations in this incorporated document of the funding set aside for advertising are deliberately conservative. There is $54 million admitted by the ATO that covers general GST advertising, $46 million for the disgraceful chains campaign, $3.4 million  for the farmers campaign, at least $4 million spent on the pay-as-you-go campaign, at least $15 million for the ABN campaign, $4 million for the family and community services campaign—that is for John and Wendy and the pensioners—and at least $7 million for the ACCC. That is $133 million in this financial year alone. There is around $50 million set aside for the out years, and we are now informed that there is going to be a GST help line advertising campaign after 1 July. You do not know where this ends.</para><para>You also have to include in the government advertising expenditure graph the $15 million spent on the Lifetime Health Cover umbrella advertising campaign in which the government has set about scaring people witless into taking out private health cover and, worse still, worrying those people who simply cannot afford it. The campaign deliberately fails to tell Australians that they are covered by Medicare. The year 2000 really has been a bonanza for the advertising companies and the research companies, hasn't it? We calculate that, in the four months from March to the end of June, $148.9 million has been spent by the government on the GST and health insurance campaigns alone. These are remarkable figures. Once the bills arrive from the advertisers and are paid, the figures are obviously going to reveal that the Commonwealth has spent well in excess of $150 million in taxpayer funded advertisements in three or four months. By the end of the entire promotional exercise, the government will have spent at least $431 million. This is an astonishing amount of money. This is unprecedented in Australian history.</para><para>You have to look at what the Auditor-General's recommended guidelines state about taxpayer funded advertisements. In his report on the CEIP, the Auditor-General said:</para><quote><para>Materials should be presented in an unbiased and objective language and in a manner free from partisan promotion of government policy and political argument. </para></quote><para>And he said:</para><quote><para>Materials should not attack or directly scorn the views, policy or actions of others such as the policies of opposition parties and groups.</para></quote><para>Look at the centrepiece of the $431 million promotional assault. Look at the $46 million community information and awareness campaign, known to all and sundry as the `chains campaign'. If the government followed the Auditor-General's recommendations—if they were accepted within government—the chains campaign would not have got to first base. That campaign, the <inline font-style="italic">Unchain My Heart</inline> campaign, would be struck out. We know there is $20 million for placement of advertising in the chains campaign. There was $13 million for production costs. There was $10 million for the projected prime ministerial mail-out—the illegal, corrupt mail-out by the Prime Minister. The remainder of that was for research and ancillary purposes. Was the campaign informative? Was it objective? Was the campaign political? Of course it was political. It was political propaganda. But the Labor Party prevented the Prime Minister, the tax office and the Australian Electoral Commission from committing an offence—from committing an illegal act, breaking the law because we the Labor Party—the opposition—had to hold the government accountable and expose the intended use of the electoral roll, which would have made the original proposed mail-out by the Prime Minister illegal.</para><para>We still have a prime ministerial letter. All the individual salutations had to be junked—those letters had to be pulped—though everyone received a new piece of soapie propaganda from our `fellow Australian'—John Howard is not the Prime Minister any more; he is our `fellow Australian'. Doesn't that give you a lot of confidence? All of this soapie propaganda from our `fellow Australian' went through the letterbox, but at least it was not illegal, thanks to the Labor Party. I commend to the Senate the document that I have incorporated tonight so that anyone who is genuinely interested in the cost of advertising campaigns can see what has occurred over the past few months. There are 431 million really good reasons why this parliament should hold the government accountable and adopt some clear rules about such public advertising. This is a government of manipulators, rorters and frauds, and they stand exposed in their advertising campaigns. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>16144</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For all those masses who are watching tonight's debate, I should explain: we are, at this stage of the night, basically filling in a bit of time. I am talking about the people in their rooms here, glued to the television because the SBS movie is not so crash hot tonight. We are waiting on two messages from the House of Representatives so we can conclude the session's business. In order to assist the government's program, Senator Faulkner and I both indicated we would drop off the speakers list to facilitate things, but at the last minute we were resuscitated and sent back into battle.</para></talk.start><para>The good thing about appropriation bills is that you can wander far and wide and canvass a diverse range of issues. I will be forced to do that tonight because I had to make some notes in a bit of a hurry. The first issue I want to address is a serious one—and that is to commend the Privileges Committee report that was put down in the parliament here today. Certainly we had to accelerate the timetable. This basically revolves around the issue of the protection of documents given to MPs. Some months ago, Justice Jones of the Queensland court handed down a ruling saying there was no protection and no privilege attached to documents given to members of parliament—this was not central to Justice Jones's ruling, by the way; he was really ruling on two other matters in terms of a potential non-continuance of a case—but it did give us quite substantial concerns. As a result of that, the Privileges Committee took two actions: it asked our esteemed Clerk for his views—and I recommend people read the six-page opinion that he has given the committee; and, secondly, with the support of the President of the Senate, we were able to commission Mr Brett Walker, a senior counsel from Sydney, who also has given us his views—a 10- or 12-page document that closely analyses the Jones judgment and provides alternatives. </para><para>This matter cannot be taken much further until it is considered substantively in a court somewhere, but I do draw attention to those two particular opinions that were tabled in the Senate today. They affect every senator in the chamber in the long term, and they also affect at least one ex-senator who is no longer in the chamber and who has been pursued vexatiously by a litigant—most unfairly, in my view. I hope that today's action will at least give him some support.</para><para>The second issue I raise today is the lack of answers from estimates committees, at least the ones I have been involved in. We have three broad areas come before the finance and public administration estimates committee: the Senate, the Prime Minister's department and the Department of Finance and Administration. I must say that the 30 day cut-off point is never a question for the Senate. I have never known them not to get their answers in within three or four days. It was always prompt. But, apart from the Governor-General's office and two other minor exceptions, we have not seen an answer from the others before the deadline of 28 June. There are a raft of questions for Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance and Administration, and no answers have been produced within the deadline. We know that is not always the department's fault. Often those answers go to ministers and take weeks to be cleared. But one cannot help but suspect that on this occasion they are sitting in ministers' offices waiting for parliament to rise before they are produced and sent on to the relevant committee secretariat for dispersal to senators. We asked a number of questions on 2 May about Employment National. The department worked extremely hard to get the answers together. They apparently got to the minister's office, we are informed, on 23 May. When did we receive them? We received them on 28 June. Most of those answers would have been useful in the hearings on 25 and 26 May for follow-through, but we were deprived of them. </para><para>I am not here to assert that a department can get in every answer that is taken on notice. Some are complex. Some do require not only research but mature consideration of the way in which they will be presented. But in many cases I think the delays are due to ministerial incompetence or failure to have proper organisation in a minister's office, and in some cases they are deliberately delayed. But I do think that, in regard to some of those answers to questions asked between 24 May and in my case up to about 29 May, we could have been provided with answers. The irony was that we were not sweating on those answers to ask questions in this place. I do not think there were any of those subjects that we intended to actually follow up at question time here. But we do set a limit of about a month and we expect the answers to come in, and the performance so far has been extremely bad.</para><para>Moving on from that, another issue I want to address tonight is the concept of the centenary medal. We had some views given to us by the Governor-General's office, but it quickly became apparent that the concept of the centenary medal and the way it was developing were really within the Prime Minister's department, in the honours, awards and symbols section of that department. This has been a very poorly thought-through concept. The decision has been made to strike 20,000 medals. The decision has been made that the states get 70 per cent of those medals and the Commonwealth gets 30 per cent. There have been no criteria developed on what would merit someone getting a centenary medal. In the end they are going to be given to ministers and others just to hand out. So the government in its patronage can hand out 4,800 medals. I have to concede that the leader of the Labor Party has been allocated 200, but I think it is highly unlikely he will be taking up the offer, because if there are no criteria all sorts of cronyism will occur in handing these medals out. Many good people will get them but many others will not. Many medals will just be handed out by ministers in order to curry political favour. Can't you just imagine Minister Moore in the electorate of Ryan? Can't you guarantee that some of the newly recruited members in the electorate of Ryan are going to get a centenary medal?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—About 10 per cent of the membership.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—That is probably about all that it would cover.

We will strike a centenary medal and off we go.' By the way, I am not saying that state governments are not going to use them for patronage reasons. They may well do so. But they may also have the integrity to try to set up some sort of selection criteria. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—They may not have ministers handing them out, either.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—And they may not have ministers handing them out. The Governor-General gets 25. The Prime Minister gets 375 but the Governor-General gets 25. I think the President and the Speaker get only 25 each. But each claptrap cabinet minister gets 200, and there are a few other variations on the scam. There is no correlation as to who gets the sports medals and who gets the centenary medals, so presumably some people will get a double-up. It is an absolute shambles.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been no acknowledgment of the centenary medal in the publications of the honours, awards and symbols section of the Prime Minister's department. Really, this is irretrievable in terms of stopping the process, so at least put some form in the process. At least establish some merit criteria by which people can be judged. The great trick of this is that you cannot link the minister back to the recipient of the medal. They are not recording it that way; it will not be made publicly available. So you cannot hold the minister at the table here—I am sure he would not do it—responsible for the couple of hundred medals he hands out. I am sure the minister at the table will pick worthy recipients, but I do not share that confidence in some of his colleagues.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—He mightn't have the opportunity.

Senator Faulkner has raised a serious issue. I have to express a fair degree of concern about how these reports appear in newspapers about reshuffles. Senator Herron tells us that he is not going and that he is going to stick it out. Senator Newman tells us that she is going to stick it out. I think former Senator Bishop, now Minister Bishop, has expressed confidence in staying in the government for many years to come. So how do these rumours get to newspapers? Do they just make them up? You can accuse newspapers of a lot of things but I do not think they have made these up. These stories must be sourced to somewhere. Who is putting them out? Is it the Prime Minister's press office? Is it jealous colleagues? Who is putting out these particular rumours?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am sure it is not Senator Herron and I am sure it is not Senator Newman who have put these canards abroad. It is a terrible thing because it weakens people's confidence in ministers when they think they are about to get moved on to a diplomatic post or back to the back bench, et cetera. But I can assure you of one thing: these rumours, these sorts of things that are in newspapers do not come from our side. They must come from the Liberal side of politics. For instance, if these things occurred, where would the Prime Minister look for replacements, I ask you? Firstly, they would have to be lawyers, because there are 18 lawyers out of 30 in the ministry. But who would in fact replace them? Rumour has it that you have to replace a Tasmanian with a Tasmanian.

So it is a problem. Then, of course, if Senator Herron were to go off into the sunset—God forbid—who is there to replace him? We know at least one candidate has removed the diamond from his ear to look a little more acceptable. His 20-odd year membership of the Labor Party is a bit harder to expunge, but he is working hard on that. He is joining the Prime Minister on the bus trip up to Moree. He is rumoured as a possibility. Then, if Minister Bishop goes, who could possibly replace Mrs Bronwyn Bishop? I am not going to speculate on all the names out there. There are, of course, more ambitions than there are places to fill. But how do these rumours get started? Will we have a reshuffle or not? I do not think we can. The one thing we can say in this chamber is that Senator Herron and Senator Newman are men and women of honour, and they would not deny going if, in fact, there were intended to go.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will move on to another matter that has me somewhat concerned, and that is the clash this week—albeit a beat-up, it is said—between Mr Max Moore-Wilton and Senator H.E. Minchin. They had a major battle, apparently, over the nuclear power reactor. Even though I have some antipathy to Mr Max Moore-Wilton and some of his behaviour, that should not colour my judgment here. Ministers must prevail. Ministers who get a cabinet decision in their favour are winners, and it is not up to bureaucrats—no matter how high they are—to try to backdoor and influence those decisions. That is apparently what happened in this case. It was only the exposure by the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>—from a source we know not where—that put this issue on the public boil. Now, Mr Max Moore-Wilton has backed off, and not before good time.</para><para>There are only two other matters that I want to raise here tonight. One of my colleagues when I first came here was Dr Dick Klugman. I had been here only four days and I was having a meal in the parliamentary dining room when I was introduced to Dick Klugman. The first thing he did was to take four big slices of bread and get big slabs of butter and butter them. He then got the salt shaker and put salt on all of it. And I thought, `This is my sort of doctor.' As I got to know him better I found that he was a very irascible gentleman. He chaired the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform—and I found Ralph Hunt a better ally than Dick Klugman when it came to reliability of voting on the various fixes we were trying to put in. He was a colourful character. </para><para>He recently wrote to the ASIO committee—and there is nothing we can do about it—complaining that a particular individual accessed their ASIO file, not Dick Klugman's file, and that in that ASIO file Dick Klugman is mentioned as a current or former member of the Communist Party. This has upset him intensely. Anyone who knows Dick Klugman would know that he was intensely anti-communist—he could have played Bob Santamaria on a break. So to be so described in an ASIO document was highly offensive to him. This is the individual who sent a question on notice to the minister for science asking the minister to explain why the Soviet Union had had 60 bad successive weather years that wrecked the wheat crop and was not collectivisation or anything else. You do not have to be on the Right to oppose communism. A lot of people on the Left opposed a monolithic communist hegemony. Dick Klugman was a classic civil libertarian who would not brook communism. So to be so described in the ASIO file was extremely disappointing.</para><para>I can at least put on the public record, and I am sure colleagues here who knew him well could also attest, that Dick was never Red. He was irascible, he was inconsistent on occasions, he was acerbic—he was all those things. But he never had the personality that could have fitted into an undemocratic centralist organisation such as the Communist Party.</para><para>The final thing I wanted to return to, because we mentioned it earlier tonight, was the Prime Minister's visit to Jim Murphy's wine cellar at Fyshwick. I was a bit surprised when I saw the Prime Minister go to Fyshwick! But the thing that most surprised me, from a political point of view, was: where was the advance man? You never send a Prime Minister out without checking it out first. The news tonight was fascinating—watching the cameras roll, watching the Prime Minister get the two dockets. He was nervous, it is true, until he read that there was a $22 difference and that everyone would be better off on Saturday. Then the camera seemed to fade and then suddenly light up as someone pointed out that the bottle of Scotch had been put through twice and everything would cost $1.50 more on Saturday. It is one of the vintage pieces of film. It could happen to any political leader. But I'll tell you what: at 1.30 this morning, I would not like to be the staffer who organised this one. Somewhere in Canberra, someone is rolling from one side of the bed to the other, wondering whether they are going to get a pink slip in the morning. If they have got any problems in this regard, I suggest they go down and be counselled by Peter Knott, the Labor Party candidate who took Paul Keating into a cake shop. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>16148</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The appropriation bill gives an opportunity to speak on something that has fascinated me in recent times.

It is an astonishing change in an area that was bedrock solid Country Party, then National Party, for something like 70 years since the 1920s. I find it exceptional that my relatives, who once would never have thought it was in any way possible to support the Labor Party, now concede that there is a fifty-fifty chance in every election that they will vote for the Labor Party. They see the National Party as no longer relevant to their interests, their issues or their economic future. This change that is taking place in regional Australia is really quite historic. There was a by-election in Benalla recently. Two elections ago, the Labor Party vote was 25 per cent; it is now 52 per cent—and that is a seat that the Labor Party has never held in its whole history.</para><para>When you look right around Australia, there are now opportunities for the Labor Party to win seats we never thought that we could win. The reason is that, after 50 to 60 years, ordinary people in those areas realise that voting for the National Party, particularly if they have a farming background, no longer automatically delivers to them an economic future.</para><para>In recent times, the National Party seems to have had a crisis a day. There was the issue of the caravan park residents at the National Party conference at Tweed Heads. The massacre the National Party put itself through over that issue could not get the Prime Minister to budge. Three days later, the Democrats got the Prime Minister to shift. The National Party could not get him to shift at all—a further example that the National Party is nothing but cannon fodder for the Liberal Party in this parliament and elsewhere in Australia. The next day there was the revolt over dairy deregulation. Again, there might be a very good economic argument; it might be in the favour of my relatives on dairy farms in Victoria. But you hear National Party representatives openly admitting that, in New South Wales, Queensland and even Western Australia, dairy farming deregulation is going to wipe out a number of seats. Again, the National Party is told by the Liberal Party—dominating the National Party in the coalition—that this is what it has to accept and that this is what economic rationalism is all about. </para><para>One of the most interesting sets of figures I have seen is the 1996 census. When you compare, in the 1996 census, all the 148 electorates across Australia according to their socioeconomic income levels, the 10 poorest electorates by income in Australia are held either by the National Party or by the Liberal Party. It is quite interesting to note that the poorest electorate per income in Australia is the electorate of Lyne in New South Wales—a seat the National Party has held since before the Second World War. All that time, people in those electorates loyally voted for the National Party and, the more they voted for them, the bigger their economic decline. It is the same for outback electorates. The decline in incomes has been consistent since the Second World War. There was a bit of a spurt in the fifties with the wool boom—and, after the Second World War, shortages of food in Western Europe meant there were good prices and good markets—but, since the fifties, the decline in incomes in regional and rural Australia has been quite significant.</para><para>The National Party has proved absolutely ineffective in defending and preserving the incomes of the constituents who have loyally voted for it. People in these electorates were more than forgiving to the National Party for so long. They kept voting them back in. But, in the last four or five years—certainly since the election of the Howard government in 1996—we have seen regional and rural Australia wake up to the fact that, by voting for the National Party, all they get is more misery, less income and a greater decline in services in country towns, particularly the small country towns that stretch throughout the major agricultural areas of Australia.</para><para>Therefore, although the Labor Party are never overly optimistic about our chances in some of the formerly safe rural seats, there is a real chance for us. But, on election night next year—if the election is put off until October of next year—there will be astonishing results in some seats in rural and regional Australia, which the Labor Party will win. There will be astonishing results in seats like Benalla, which we have never won before, and seats like Narracan in Victoria, which we have not held since 1954. We have won state seats in New South Wales and Victoria. This all augurs well, and it will be up to the Labor Party to get the message out that we are the party that will consistently protect and provide services to country towns. The establishment of Country Labor in New South Wales and the Country Labor Association in South Australia is showing that people in country electorates have realised that it is no use to them to consistently vote for one party, turning their seats into safe seats, and to give their support to the National Party when the National Party does not deliver.</para><para> If you were a farmer or a person living in a small country town in regional and rural Australia, you would be much better off to vote the Labor Party in, make your seat marginal and at least try to get back to your electorate some benefits that the National Party has not been able to deliver. I have to say that after 50-odd years it is good to see that some regional and rural people are waking up to their future. It will be a very interesting election and we look forward to seeing on election night some very good results in federal seats, with some that we have not won at all before coming over to the Labor Party. Senator Herron, who is representing the government here at the moment, has probably had more battles with the National Party in Queensland than even the Labor Party has had. I do not suspect, Senator Herron, that you would be too disappointed to see a number of National Party seats fall to the Labor Party and then, in the following election, you would try to run Liberal candidates in them. I do think, Senator Herron, that, as a former state president of the Liberal Party, despite all your own problems, you may well think that there might be some long-term advantage for the demise of the National Party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—I've got no problems.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—You've got no problems but your party in Queensland has a few—that is what I am saying, Senator Herron.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—Oh, I see. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—So the changes in the last couple of years have been quite historic movements and one of those is now reflected in most of the opinion polls. I do agree with Malcolm Fraser that there is only one poll that counts and that is on election day. But earlier this year in the Morgan poll something occurred that I had never seen happen before in the history of the Morgan poll: with every federal voting intention in every one of the six states the Labor Party was in excess of 50 per cent, two party preferred. That has never occurred before in the history of Morgan polling. Morgan may not be the best pollster in the world and we may have had some arguments, but he picked the Victorian result pretty closely and he picked the South Australian result pretty closely in recent times. He does make the point that, rather than doing telephone polling, he has gone back to a method of actually getting people to fill in a ballot paper and put it in the ballot box at the doorstep, so it is a genuinely secret ballot or a secret vote. I suspect he is starting to detect that people who have traditionally been long-term National Party or Liberal Party voters do not want to admit to anybody else that they are switching their vote to the Labor Party but will do that in a secret ballot. So I think all of that is an encouraging sign that the Labor Party will again have a spectacular result at the next federal election in winning seats.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>16150</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With regard to the appropriation bills, I thought they were where we started off this evening—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name></talker><para>—We're still there.

It is very rare for me to get asked by you to make some remarks and I note that. There was a discussion about the amendment that was moved by the Democrats. This amendment caused the government considerable concern, not the least of which we felt had led to perverse results. So we did not find that amendment acceptable in a technical sense. Equally, we felt that the bill itself covered the concerns that the Democrats had in this regard. There were discussions between the non-government parties and the government and there was an agreement which I hope will be adhered to, certainly by the Labor Party. The Labor Party sought certain assurances about how this bill would operate and I am happy to give those assurances now. I am able to give an undertaking to the Senate that under the provisions of this bill professional bodies and industry organisations such as the NTAA, NFF, AMA, et cetera, which are not registered tax agents, are able to charge a fee for service for giving advice to their members on taxation laws and tax related matters. That was the nub of a somewhat extensive debate we had earlier this evening. Following consultations with my advisers, I am able to give that assurance. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16152</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the motion not to insist.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>16152</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In view of what has been said, we will support the motion and not insist, but could I ask just one question, Minister?

I might say a few things about that. I would like to put the question to the Assistant Treasurer: would the government be prepared to commit to tabling figures which show the revenue collected by this measure every six months from 1 January 2001? We do see substantial merit in the amendment that was put forward by the Australian Labor Party and was passed by the Senate. We are unable to understand why the government is opposed to the merit of that amendment. It seems to me to be pretty clear. It is an amendment which deals with a simple review and reporting obligation on the part of the ATO. But, as I said, we will not be insisting on that amendment. I reiterate that I honestly cannot understand the government's opposition to the substance of the bill in that respect. In any event, it is very late and I know that senators do not want to be kept any longer than they need to be, so I indicate again the Democrats will be supporting the motion.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>16153</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was interested very much in that explanation by the Australian Democrats. The opposition will insist on amendments Nos 1, 6 and 13. It will insist on all of them. We think that amendment No. 1, the report to the parliament, has not been adequately explained by the government. There is a need to encode in the legislation a requirement that there be a report. The government have lauded the so-called advantages of their system, and now they are declining to provide a mechanism by which they would be required to report on what in fact is the outcome of the tax system in this respect. Therefore, it can be clearly seen as an attempt by the government to escape scrutiny. The assurances that the minister has tried to infer—although not actually give—are not assurances that in any way encourage us to believe that adequate reporting would take place if this amendment was not insisted on. Therefore, we would vote to insist on this amendment. </para></talk.start><para>Amendment No. 6 is an amendment by the Australian Democrats which the Labor Party supported and which we now continue to support. My understanding of what has just been said is that the Democrats will not insist on this amendment. I note the affirmative nod of Democrats Senator Ridgeway, and I acknowledge that that is the position of the Australian Democrats. The Australian Labor Party would, however, insist that this amendment should be persisted with. We do so because it is fundamental to the government keeping its word in an arrangement reached between the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, that underpinned the opposition's commitment to the passage of the business tax reform group of bills.</para><para>One of the central elements of that package was the reduction of capital gains tax, a cutting in half of capital gains tax—a reduction of 50 per cent. On the other hand, there were commitments to conform with the Ralph committee of inquiry report on the alienation of personal services income which would have ensured that the total package of business tax reform was revenue neutral. For us, the commitment to revenue neutrality was the central reason that we could justify a situation of endorsing the package in its entirety.</para><para>There was another reason why it was necessary to commit ourselves to this package, and that was that the business community of Australia did require long, strong signals about constancy in the business tax framework. We, as a responsible party of opposition and not an oppositionist party, believed that, for the sake of the economy and for the predictability of the business tax framework, it was necessary for us as well to indicate support for the package. But what happened? The shadow Treasurer believed that there was a need for the Treasurer to make the commitment on personal services income in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the House of Representatives and asked that that be done. The Treasurer did that. But when it came to the legislation, the Treasurer got done over in his party room, or certainly did not fight strongly enough for the commitment he had made in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to the Labor Party and, specifically, to the person of the shadow Treasurer. On the other hand, we in the Labor Party did stand up for our commitment—and it was not an easy decision by us in our party room to commit to the package.</para><para>The fact that the government has walked away from its commitment is a shameful thing—it is a shameful thing in the sense that, once again, how can we ever trust it—and it also shows contempt by the government for the processes of the parliament. A commitment was made in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, which was then promptly dishonoured. We attach a considerable importance to the alienation of personal services income. We believe it would be an essential step in preventing a massive haemorrhaging of the revenue base, and it was entirely appropriate for the Ralph committee to report on what we regarded as an acceptable means of dealing with that. The amendment that the Australian Democrats moved, which we supported in the previous debate on this bill, went to the fourth test, as it is commonly referred to—the test under which the Commissioner of Taxation is equipped with powers to make a consideration against certain criteria as to whether a person who earns more than 80 per cent of their income through a sole client is entitled to be regarded as a contractor. </para><para>This is an important element of the package because the powers that this section vests in the Commissioner of Taxation enable him to sift out the genuine contractors from those who are not genuine contractors. The strengthening of the tests that the Australian Democrats provided for in their amendment was something that we believed was necessary to give integrity to this measure. Now it has come back, it has been rejected by the House and it is not being insisted upon here by a majority in this chamber. We firmly assert that it should be insisted upon and we will oppose the motion, we will vote against the motion, and, if necessary, we will divide on the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>16154</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cook, we have had that debate over quite a prolonged period.

The government has fulfilled its commitment as it always seeks to do.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Ridgeway, let me make some observations on the comments you made. I am happy to refer those comments to the Treasurer and bring them to his attention. But let me make it clear that the Australian Taxation Office is responsible, as we all know, for the administration of tax laws in Australia and the ATO does work to ensure compliance with all tax laws. When this bill becomes law, it will be no exception. Therefore we do not agree that it is necessary to have special provisions in the law. Each year the commissioner reports to the parliament about all the laws that he administers. In respect of some laws, for example fringe benefits tax, it is possible to quantify easily the revenue collected. Under this measure, the revenue gain will be part of the overall income tax collections. It will not be easy just to have them separated out, but I am happy to bring your request to the Treasurer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>16154</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I shall be brief, but I do not imagine anyone is going to miss a plane if I speak for a minute or two.

Obviously Senator Cook feels this is a circumstance where what he believes is the magical Costello-Crean business tax deal has been somewhat watered down by virtue of moving away from something that the Treasurer put on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. Perhaps it would be a circumstance where one could put back to the opposition the difficulties one faces in any situation where you have to actually put trust in what others say and others put on the record, even if it is on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, or commitments made to the Australian people. Nonetheless, in the context of this particular legislation, this is a bill which overall advances the situation compared to the bill not passing, and always we have to decide whether what is there is a move forward. Obviously that is a judgment that has been made in this particular case.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>16155</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not delay the committee too long. I was anticipating some criticism from the Australian Labor Party and I am not surprised, but on that issue I am less concerned about that than I am about the prospect of being criticised for assisting tax avoiders, and the issue is about being able to close the loopholes. I make the point for the record that, just as on Tuesday of this week the Labor Party did not insist on their amendments to the Corporations Law entitlements bill—a bill of more consequences than the one we are dealing with at the moment—on the basis that they could see the benefits in the bill and did not want to frustrate its passage, so we can see that it is time to close the significant loopholes dealt with by this bill. The political reality is what needs to be kept in mind, and that is that, by insisting on this series of amendments, the passage of the bill could well be delayed until August, and that is something that the Democrats will not participate in.  </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>02:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>16155</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Chair, I wonder if you would put each of these amendments separately.

Those people who have served as whips, leaders or managers in this place, and indeed many others—and I think of ministers—will know that the Senate in Australia could not work without the services of a Parliamentary Liaison Officer, known as the PLO. Furthermore, senators will know that during the period since about November 1996 the Senate has dealt with an extraordinary amount of legislation. It has dealt with extraordinarily complex legislation which has, and will continue to do so, changed Australia in significant and historic ways.</para></talk.start><para>The legislative program that has been dealt with during the past almost four years has seen some historic changes—the biggest tax reform in Australian history; a significant privatisation program; significant industrial reform. I do not seek to be at all political in this speech, but I think that all senators know, from the complexity of many of the bills, the pure weight of legislation that has passed through this place and the negotiation that has been required between ministers' offices, members of the opposition, independent senators and the Democrats, that the workload on the PLO has, arguably, been the heaviest in this past few years than has ever been noticed in the past.</para><para>I have found it a great honour and a privilege to serve with Gail Bansemer.

Mr Dickson's sister was married to an Australian and has lived in this country for the past 52 years. She has no other family in Australia and is unable to live alone.</para><para>During this six month period, Mr Dickson provided the care his sister required. It became apparent that his sister continued to need him. So, he decided to stay and provide that care for her.</para><para>As he was completely unaware of the necessity to do so, he did not renew his visa by the 26 February 1998 and remained in Australia caring for his sister.</para><para>Mr Dickson travelled home to Ireland for a last visit to take care of his affairs and re entered Australia on 10 March 1999. What is remarkable about this re-entry is that he did so, without a valid visa! As the visa had never been renewed.</para><para>It did not come to the attention of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, that Mr Dickson had entered the country illegally, adding to his confusion regarding his status. He believed that he was here for the duration, to provide the care that his sister continued to need.</para><para>Mr Dickson first came to the attention of my Electorate Office on 7 January 2000 after being referred by his local State Member of Parliament, Nita Cunningham. While my office was investigating another related problem on his behalf, it became apparent, through contact with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, that Mr Dickson had no lawful status. His visa had expired back in February 1998. The Department advised that Mr Dickson had lodged a claim for permanent residency in December 1998.</para><para>However, as he failed to pay the appropriate fee, it was not registered. Nonetheless, Mr Dickson believed he had made an appropriate application.</para><para>It was then that a bridging visa E - subclass 050 was organised, through my office, to allow Mr Dickson lawful status, while an appropriate claim for permanent residency in his role as a carer was arranged. The visa that he needs to apply for was a Carer subclass 836 visa. The bridging visa was granted on 31 January 2000 for a three month period.</para><para>However, unfortunately, due in part to the distances involved (my office is in Brisbane Mr Dickson is in Bundaberg some hundreds of kilometres away) and his complete lack of understanding regarding his situation, his claim for Carer subclass 836 visa was not lodged.</para><para>Then on 6 April 2000, I received a response to representations made to Mr Phillip Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, regarding Mr Dickson's situation. This letter advised Mr Dickson to apply for a carer's visa and the relevant application form was enclosed for his completion. I have here a copy of the Minister's letter, which I accepted and acted upon in all good faith.</para><para>A copy of the letter was forwarded for Mr Dickson's attention together with the application form, and he was again encouraged to make an application.</para><para>On 23 May 2000, a representative from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs telephoned my Electorate Officer and informed her that Mr Dickson's bridging visa E had now expired (on 30 April 2000) and he was again considered unlawful. A new bridging visa application form was sent and my office again had contact with Mr Dickson to arrange for its completion. The new bridging visa E - subclass 050 was granted on 30 May 2000 again for a period of three months.</para><para>During the process of completing this visa application with Mr Dickson, my Electorate Officer had a very lengthy telephone conversation with him and impressed successfully this time, the importance of lodging his application for a carer's visa. The cost was somewhat of an issue, but his sister was going to try and arrange some finance for him.</para><para>It was only after this was completed, that my office was then advised, for the first time, that there was a time limit for Mr Dickson to apply for the carer's visa. This time had expired in March of this year, so Mr Dickson could not lodge an application for carer's visa and had no option but to return to Ireland during the period of his bridging visa, that is before 30 August! </para><para>My Electorate Office made repeated pleas on Mr Dickson's behalf with the Permanent Residence Section of the Brisbane Office of the Department, advising them of Mr Dickson's age and reason for being here and his lack of comprehension regarding this situation.</para><para>My Office also advised them regarding the Minister's letter dated 6 April 2000. However, all the staff, including the Officer in Charge, could do was to quote the relevant legislation in the Migration Regulations relating to Schedule 3.</para><para>An applicant for Carer subclass 835 visa is required to meet Schedule 3 criterion 3002 (clause 836.211 (a)). Schedule 3 criterion 3002 requires an application to be validly made within 12 months of the day that the applicant ceased to hold a substantive visa or entered Australian unlawfully.</para><para>As Mr Dickson was allowed to enter the country unlawfully on 10 March 1999, then for the purposes of satisfying Schedule 3, he therefore needed to make a valid application by 10 March 2000.</para><para>I guess it is all here in black and white.</para><para>However, there is one small problem. This was not communicated to Mr Dickson nor to my Electorate Office, who the Department was very well aware, were liaising on Mr Dickson's behalf. When they wanted assistance in the completion of a bridging visa application form, they simply picked up the telephone and contacted my Electorate Officer and it was done.</para><para>However, when it comes to communicating information vital to the future of my constituents, Mr Dickson and his invalid sister, then no, the Department keeps this quiet!!!!!</para><para>I find it incredulous that, after so many conversations and communications between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and my office over a 5 month period, this extremely important fact was overlooked.</para><para>Had the Department mentioned this fact even once, the urgency would have been communicated to Mr Dickson, even if I had to go to Bundaberg to see him personally to do so!</para><para>As well as the fact that I have here in my hands a letter from Mr Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, dated 6 April 2000, which clearly states that Mr Dickson has the option of applying for a visa to care for his blind sister and then lists the requirements of the visa and encloses the relevant application form. This is all after March 2000, which I am now advised was the deadline for such an application.</para><para>Mr Dickson is an elderly Irish gentleman 84 years of age, who has extremely poor communication skills, and his comprehension of these matters is limited. It has taken extensive work by two of my experienced Electorate Staff and the personal contact of the office of Nita Cunningham, State Member for Bundaberg, to finally communicate to him the nature of his situation.</para><para>Mr Dickson never understood any of the communications received from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and was totally unaware of the fact that he was only given a six-month visitor's visa upon his original entry into this country. Being allowed to return to Australia in March 1999 without a valid visa only then exacerbated his confusion regarding his status.</para><para>I know it must be difficult for the Department to accept that when they write a letter to someone that the person, whilst able to read the letter, does not comprehend its meaning, but there are many people like this in the real world. I see them all the time in my office.</para><para>Mr Dickson's only intention was and continued to be to care for his widowed blind sister and to be her constant companion.

As  part of its Uruguay Round commitments, the US is cutting the tariffs on greasy wool of less than 32 micron by 15% and on wool top by 50% over the period 1996 to 2004.  Another outcome of the Uruguay Round is the elimination by 1 January 2005 of US quantitative restrictions, including quotas, against developing countries (these restrictions do not apply to Australia) which will see the textile and clothing trade fully integrated into GATT 1994.  This will provide an indirect but significant boost for Australian wool exports, particularly to developing countries, some of which are among our major customers for Australian wool. In the longer term, these countries will have greater access to the US market. </para><para>Australia will also be promoting efforts to liberalise wool tariffs in the mandated round of multilateral agriculture negotiations which commenced this year.  Associated with this, Australia is also taking a leading role in the WTO in pressing for comprehensive negotiations on industrial tariffs, including tariffs on textiles and clothing.  Once these negotiations are underway, Australia will be seeking to focus attention on tariff and non-tariff barriers restricting the trade of wool textiles and clothing in all countries, including the USA. </para><para>The Australian Government and industry are working closely to address trade barriers to wool and wool products.  In early April 2000 I (Mr Vaile) launched the Wool Council of Australia's study on US barriers to wool fibre products trade.  The study found that the cost to Australian woolgrowers of US tariff and quota barriers amounted to A$17 million per year.  The study quantifies and clearly shows that the US has chosen to integrate the majority of wool products in the last stage of the phase-out period, thereby discriminating against wool.  The study also pointed out that US suitmakers are disadvantaged by having to pay a higher tariff for fine wool fabric than apparel importers pay on a suit made from the same fabric.  The Government has made representations to the US about its trade barriers to wool and wool products.</para><para>In May 2000, United States Congress passed the US Trade and Development Act of 2000, which was signed into law by President Clinton on 18 May. The Act reduces wool suiting fabric tariffs, from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003, as follows:</para><para>. For fabric of wool 18.5 micron and finer, from 29.4% to 6% with an import quantity limit of 1 million square metres equivalent (SME) annually; and</para><para>. For fabric of wool greater than 18.5 micron, from 29.4% to an effective rate of 18.8% with further reductions to 18.4% in 2002 and 18% in 2003. The quantity limit will be 2.5 million SMEs per year. This tariff reduction of over 10% is expected to provide renewed export opportunities for Australian fabric makers whose exports to the US have been in steep decline over the period 1997 to date.</para><para>For Australian woolgrowers the reductions in tariffs on wool fabric are expected to strengthen demand for fine and superfine wool, especially from Italy and to a lesser extent from Mexico, Canada, Korea, India and the UK, all of which are significant exporters of fine wool fabric to the US.  The Trade and Development Act also extends duty-free entry, from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003, to raw wool, top and yarn made from wool of 18.5 micron and finer, but this is expected to have little impact on Australian exports of raw wool and top as very little wool of 18.5 micron and finer is combed (or processed) in the USA. </para><para>The Australian Government will continue to urge the US to reconsider its phase-out timetable for tariff duties on wool and wool products.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts: Fringe Benefits Tax Paid</title><page.no>16170</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2310)</subtitle><id.no>2310</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>16170</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 June 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) What was the value of fringe benefits tax (FBT) payments made by the department;
