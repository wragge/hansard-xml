At the outset I might just say that if there are some senators missing from the chamber this morning it may well be due to the traffic jams which have been casued by the V8 car racing being imposed on Canberra at the moment. I believe the delay is up to 40 minutes for some people making the approach outside Parliament House at the moment. That aside, I refer to Channel 9's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program in May last year when reporter Ross Coulthart interviewed New Zealand author and researcher Nicky Hager. Mr Hager talked about the giant computer systems which use dictionary systems to track down selected phone calls, faxes and Internet communications coming in and out of Australia and indeed going between other countries. One of these facilities is at Geraldton in Western Australia, and most Australians know very little about it. Mr Hager said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>One of the defining features of the Echelon systemâ</para></quote><para>that is, this giant computer tracking system on everybody's phone callsâ</para><quote><para>is that it is a move away from what is the most effective way to spy on our enemies to a system which is the most effective way of spying on everyone.</para></quote><para>That is the reality of the modern world. While this bill points us towards intervention in phone calls for criminals, drug handlers and spies, in effect what it is not doing is saying that our whole spying system is being moved to an international system which spies on everybody's phone calls. Most Australians are not aware of that. </para><para>The bill does refer to intervention in foreign phone callsâphone calls going out of this countryâbut what it does not say is that everybody's phone calls are being listened to, that everybody's phone calls are being scanned and, moreover, that the check on this system is not within our national boundaries. Australia has an arrangement with the UK, the United States, Canada and New Zealand whereby the downloading of selected phone callsâthe intercepted calls which the Americans, in particular, want to listen toâgoes straight to Washington. I will be asking the government during the committee stages of this debate what control Australia has over this spy system based here in Australia. I think we will find that it is close to zero; that in fact this information is being relayed straight to Washington and to other countries without proper intervention by the Australian authorities. When this bill says, `Let's intervene in certain phone calls made by criminals and people with an intent that is not in Australia's interests,' it is really missing the pointâthat is, that everybody's phone calls are being listened in to and, as far as I know, this parliament has no control over that. This parliament is not informed about it. This parliament is not a watchdog on behalf of citizens. This parliament does not know what our spy systems are doing and, more particularly, it does not know what the foreign spy systems are doing which are getting the information out of the Australian infrastructure.</para><para>We are not in an age where this is simply spyingâor even primarily spyingâin the defence interests of this country; we are in an age where commercial interests are at the forefront in spying. Indeed, President Clinton has made it very clear that, as far as the United States is concerned, the intelligence agencies are there in the interests of America's economic supremacy, its corporate interests. Information being taken from these spy facilities, including here in Australia, is passed on to the corporate systemâthe Forbes 500 and the big multinational corporationsâbecause it is in the interests of those big systems to get the drop on their competitors around the world. The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program pointed to a number of cases where an advantage had been given to either US or Canadian countriesâin one case, a wheat deal in favour of Canada, because the Canadians had picked up a phone call coming out of a car in the United Statesâa call to do with a United States bid for a world market. There was another extraordinary case cited in the Channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program of 23 May last year. Prime Minister Thatcher of the United Kingdom was presumably able to get information on two of her ministers through the Canadian connection of this spying systemâthat is, the UK arm of it was kept clean while the Canadians picked up information on two UK ministers about whom the Prime Minister of the UK of the day was not sure. Is that the intent of a spy system in which Australia is involved? What halt does this legislation put on that sort of activity occurring in the international arena against the interests of Australian people in general, let alone elected Australians? Maybe the government will be able to disclaim that extraordinary situation, as highlighted on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program. If so, I would like to hear how. </para><para>This legislation does not allow overseas phone calls to be intercepted where an Australian citizen is involved at the other end. Tell me about it! I believe that that is already occurring all over the world through this massive intercept system of telecommunications. I believe that this piece of legislation is nothing more than a diversionary titbit. It does nothing to reassure meâand will do nothing to reassure those few Australians who know about this spying systemâthat there are very clear guidelines, controlled by the elected members of this nation, on this massive international spy system. I reiterate: it is no longer in the nation's interest that this spy system be contained. There are no guidelines âor, if there are, let them be brought before this Senateâto say that this spy system is confined to working in Australia's national interests and against the interests of those who might engage in criminal or political activities that are inimical to Australia's interests. Where are those guidelines? Let the government produce themâcertainly before I will give assent to this legislation. As far as the international spying component of it is concerned, the legislation is loosely worded, ill-considered and certainly not transparent in the parliament laying down regulationsâlawsâwhich confine the activity of not just the Australian Security Intelligence Organi-sation but of the international operators like the American spy facilities which are using our facilities, as far as I know, and I will guarantee as far as any government representative here knows, against Australia's interests, for goodness sake.</para><para>Is the Channel 9 program wrong? Was it factually flawed? Is its information able to be countermanded by the government? If not, I say to the Senate: the facility at Geraldton and the similar facility in New Zealandâwhich Nicky Hagar broke into and got lists of citizens names out of because it was unattended at nightâare set up in a manner which can have US, Canadian and UK interests working against Australia's economic wellbeing. For example, it can give multinational corporations the opportunity, through the interception of telecommunications, to get the drop on their Australian competitorsâto give international markets the opportunity to beat Australia when it comes to international sales of commodities out of this country. This is laid down quite clearly on the public record.</para><para>I was amazed that that program, which went to air on 23 May last year, drew such little comment from the Australian political and business community. I am concerned as a democrat that this parliament is not in control; is not laying down guidelines as to what our intelligence operatives are allowed and not allowed to do. You look superficially at this piece of legislation and there is one sentence that says, `You can't spy on Australian citizens overseas,' but the evidence on the face of it is that every Australian citizen's phone calls are being spied upon. Moreover, Australia is allowing its facilities to be used so that foreign countries can download from this massive computerised selection of phone calls, can take that information for their own use and can pass it on to their own corporate sectors without Australians knowing about it, without the Australian security intelligence network intervening and without Australia's government or elected politicians knowing what is going on. This demands an explanation. </para><para>The government has only one representative in this chamber at the moment. It is time for them to get up and explain what is happening at Geraldton, Pine Gap and the facility in Darwin with respect to the downloading of information out of the satellite systems and the conveying of Australians' phone calls, Internet communications and faxesâeverything as far as international communications are concernedâall of which are being spied upon. One of the answers will be that in reaction to what is called the Anglo systemâthis massive Echelon computerised spying systemâthe French have responded with the same, and you could not blame the Chinese and the Indonesians for responding likewise. Everybody is into it, one presumes.</para><para>Let us have some light thrown on this system. In this democratically elected chamber, let us have an account of where we stand in the modern world of spying. Let us be clear about the fact that, post Cold War, the focus of spying has become commercial and that there is great opportunityâin fact, I think it is going on worldwideâfor commercial interests to gain or to lose by what that spy system is doing. In fact, on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program there was an inherent complaint that the information going out of the Australian and New Zealand facilities to corporations overseas gives them the drop on their Australian counterparts and there was an inherent request that, if this is going to continue, ASIO should be put at the service of the Australian corporate sector. I am not calling for that; I am calling for an explanation from the government as to what is the state of play in this system. What are the safeguards at Geraldton, Pine Gap, Darwin and the New Zealand facility? What communications are occurring between Australia and New Zealand to safeguard our national interests against the much bigger players in this field who are using our facilities? I cannot give assent to this legislation, even though all other parties in the Senate have done so, because I am very concerned that we as parliamentarians are not up to speed on this issue that affects every Australian citizen.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>14769</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI share some of the concerns that Senator Brown has mentioned this morning. However, I remain unconvinced on certain aspects of his contribution, particularly those in terms of construing more in the bill than is being proposed in its written word. In truth, I feel that I am constrained to read the bill plainly and not read between the lines too heavily. In terms of being an authority on the Channel 9 program, Pine Gap and Geraldton, I would defer to Senator Brown in that regard. Pine Gap is a matter on which I do share some of his concerns. It is a matter that has come before the treaties committee in which I participate and where, in toto, I think you could say that the answers we received were not satisfactory, although the treaties committee was looking at it from a different perspective. But we were assured that the secrecy surrounding that is necessary.</para></talk.start><para>Turning to the process itself, rather than taking Senator Brown's stand across from it, I took the opportunity to do two things. I spent some time during the estimates process asking Mr Crompton, the Privacy Commissioner, about matters that go to privacy, and to other matters that I will no doubt follow up during the next estimates process and about which I have some concern. I also took the opportunity of looking at the recent Centrelink issue regarding privacy matters. In addition, I asked whether the Privacy Commissioner could adequately deal with the extension of those requirements into the private sector. In addition, as I will mention later, I participated in an inquiry into the consideration of the <inline ref="R917">Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999</inline>. During that time I had the opportunity to question witnesses about certain aspects of the bill that concerned me and I received, by and large, adequate replies. Rather than take a scaremongering approach to the issue, I took the issue to the appropriate forums, asked the relevant questions and sought relevant replies.</para><para>One of the problems the committee did find was that, on balance, there was a certain amount of grey area that surrounded the debate itself about the use of intercepted material. So, rather than dismiss it out of hand, we took the opportunity during the inquiry of asking for a review within three years to have a look at whether or not they have confined themselves to the matters that the bill seeks to address. On balance, I came down on the side of facilitating justice administration and law enforcement. There was not a lot of complaint in this area from what you would normally regard as the other side of the fence, the people who may raise the issues that Senator Brown has gone toâand more, and more broadly as wellâand who would then, generally, uphold some of those aspects that are of civil concern and that surround the privacy and use of that information. </para><para>The committee found that the process, although short, was in fact bereft of some of the people who might otherwise have taken an interest. The committee could take two views about that. One view, of course, is that the process was such a short-lived one that those concerns were not addressed or could not be addressed in the time available. But I have found that, where that is the case, people will complain about that and put in a reservation. Or, the committee could take a second view that the bill itself was targeted at a very narrow field, a particularly narrow scope, that went to a number of certain issues, as the explanatory memorandum outlined. I guess that is how I came to feel satisfied about the recommendations contained in the inquiry and that the opportunity for people to make submissions was there. The opportunity to raise those concerns was there. The opportunity to provide sufficient evidence of the things that might concern civil libertarians was there, but they were not raised and, thus, were satisfied, at least in the immediate term. If there are matters that are still outstanding that people have concerns about, they can be reviewed and looked at, as the recommendations have provided for in the inquiry.</para><para><inline ref="R1001">Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>, in essence, will bring about a new class of interception warrants. The primary legislation, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, provides for interception warrants to be granted for the investigation of narcotic offences, under the Customs Act 1901. As you would expect, the number of agencies authorised to apply for these warrants has increased. The aim was to allow interception warrants for identified telecommunications services. In shorthand these are referred to as telecommunications service warrants. The act sets out the purpose of the warrants, the reason for which they are obtained, and who can apply for and issue such warrants. It also details the form and content of the warrant applications and the criteria that must be satisfied, and provides for stringent record keeping and the like. </para><para>The amendment has two basic purposes, the first going to national security and the second to law enforcement. In respect of the second area, where a law enforcement agency wishes to obtain an interception warrant, an application must be made to an eligible judge. They can be issued only in relation to the investigation of class 1 offences, such as murder, or class 2 offences, such as serious personal injury, drug trafficking and offences where the penalty is life or more than seven years. Agencies which can apply and have to be approved include the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and state and territory police. Applications are made with an accompanying affidavit attesting to the contents. </para><para>An example would be a class 2 offence where the judge considers the gravity and how much the privacy of the person would be interfered with. On that point, during the inquiry, one of the witnesses stated that they thought they had met all the criteria quite successfully. They had provided the affidavit, they had provided the gravity, and they had provided how the privacy of the person would be interfered with, but they were unsuccessful, because the judge found that not enough concerns were met. It was not a matter of the judge providing them with a warrant as a matter of course. This was from a senior police officer, who then went about his police work, as he relayed to the committee, reinvestigating the matter to substantiate the issue more fully.</para><para>A review of this area was conducted in May 1999, providing an avenue for people to raise concerns about privacy. The minister was subsequently presented with a policy review. The bill incorporates some of the recommendations of the telecommunications interception policy review. It provides for named person warrants to be picked up and an extension of the use to which intercepted material may be put in legal proceedings. On that point, it was reinforced during the inquiry that, in order to provide the thread in the evidentiary material that was presented to court, piles of material would have to be provided and the judge tracked through it to come to the essence of the evidence. It was hoped that most people were able to follow the bouncing ball through those proceedings. </para><para>With this bill, the evidence can be compiled in a more cogent fashion and presented in a realistic way so that the courts can at least have a fair opportunity to look at the evidence. In relation to warrants of a particular identified telecommunications service, rather than having evidentiary import, the underlying rationaleâas explained to us in the inquiryâis that the technology that has been around for the last 20 years and is developing rapidly is being overtaken by digital technology. Added to that is the change from a single provider of telecommunications services to multiple service providers. Simply put, we have gone from one telecommunications carrier with one phone service to multiple carriers, digital phones, SIMM cards, pay cards, prepaid mobile phones, email and computer technology. I think it goes on to things I could not describe accurately or well.</para><para>The policy review identified that this had in fact occurred, which was not particularly profound. The new telecommunications state of play is here, and the review highlighted that criminal elements could take advantage of these wonderful innovations, using them to assist in committing crime and avoiding detection. In addition, delays in obtaining replacement warrants were hampering speedy law enforcement. As it was described to me by a witness in the inquiry, this bill picks up some of the issues that were raised in UK and US experiences but follows closely local issues in Australia. Balanced against that, people have to be mindful of privacy concerns, centring on the possibility that non-targeted individuals could also be intercepted and the material used. </para><para>It was highlighted in the policy review that those concerns were in existence; however, they were outweighed in the end, and the policy review recommended that a warrant be issued against named individuals. The policy review also dealt with the permitted use by a court to receive into evidence intercepted information where that information has already been entered into the public domain. This gave the inquiry some trouble in terms of the admissibility of evidence and the like, but the committee felt that if it highlighted the concern in a recommendation it could at least put it aside for the moment. The bill adopts this position, and the underlying rationale of the proposed amendments is to help our law enforcement agencies to be effective in the fight against crime.</para><para>In the House of Representatives the Attorney-General added that the criteria would be more stringent for issuance and that additional reporting requirements would exist. The inquiry looked at those particular matters and, on balance, was satisfied that the spirit and intent of the legislation would be met and that, in any event, a review would highlight any deficiencies that may come about. In essence, a balance had to be struck between security and law enforcement in protection of the individual from the power of the state. The bill, as I said earlier, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which tabled its report on 11 May 2000. The terms of reference were sufficiently wide to examine the issues. They included the need for a new warrant, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of reporting mechanisms. Disappointingly, the committee did not receive many submissions from non-user organisations from, at least, a privacy perspective. That was highlighted in the report so at least the committee's concerns could be noted and if there were further concerns then they could at least be met during the following review or generally through the processes that exist in this parliament. At 1.9 the committee stated:</para><quote><para>The Committee notes its concern at the low level of participation in the inquiry by peak legal bodies and bodies focused on the privacy of the citizen.</para></quote><para>In the end, the committee did recommend that the bill be reviewed.  </para><para>I was pleased to be given the opportunity to participate in that committee's deliberations. I think concerns still remain about a steady creep forward in this area, over the use to which material may be put, about third party usage, about other lines of inquiry by police investigators chasing down third party information which is not relevant to the current inquiry that they are conducting, and that they may apprehend a crime or suspected crime being committed which is outside the scope of the particular investigation. But I think the important matters as to security concernsâthe additional reporting requirements and the ability of a judge to be, in essence, the final arbiter of these sorts of mattersâand the stringent requirements in place for material that has been intercepted, in relation to third party material, to be destroyed once the bill process has been run balance against some of those concerns. Without those concerns being highlighted by the parties, I feel constrained not to take that matter any further.</para><para>In essenceâand I keep saying this about itâthe legislation enhances law enforcement. But, if you go to the major underlying rationale of this or to the problems, there is always a dichotomy that gets raised between the state and its power and the right to privacy of individuals. It exists in Australia. As we are well aware, there is no bill of rights contained within the federal Constitution, unlike the one adopted and expressed as amendments to the Constitution by the United States in 1791. The then Chief Justice Barwick expressed itâcertainly not in 1791 but more recently than thatâin this way:</para><quote><para>Unlike the case of the American Constitution, the Australian Constitution is built upon confidence in a system of parliamentary government with ministerial responsibility.</para></quote><para>Clearly, a representative democracy would, can and should protect its citizens' fundamental rights, and the amount of rights that are currently being protected through the legislation that has come into this field in the last 10 years is very encouraging. The Australian Constitution itself has few guarantees of individual rightsâfor example, `trial by jury' at section 80 provides some rights protection, as does freedom of religion at section 116âbut they are, as I think many writers would agree, rather specific and ad hoc. </para><para>A bill of rights containing statements about human rights with emphasis on civil and political rights is one manner that can be used to protect individual freedoms from government interference. Both Canada and New Zealand have a bill of rights as an act of parliament. In Queensland, my home state, a number of committees of inquiry have also looked at this process for some years to ensure that a bill of rights contain civil and political rights to protect from arbitrary interference by the state. Recently, in November 1998, they again looked at the process. They went into some depth on this but in the final analysis, as I stated earlier, they did recommend that there be no bill of rights in Queensland. They did, however, look at proceeding with an interim position to ensure that people were at least fully informed of their particular rights and of places where they could complain about an arbitrary interference in their particular rights. They looked at a guide, called <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Basic Rights</inline>, to at least deal with some of those concerns. I see that my time has almost expired so in summary: after going through the process at some length and in some detail, the concerns that I had are satisfied by the written words contained within the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>14772</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have just a few things to say in response. I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. Senator Ludwig's contribution acknowledged the work the committee did. As to Senator Brown's contribution: Senator Brown, you might be lucky, it might be a slow news day and there might be a journalist who has not read the bill, who is happy to take your remarks at face value, and you will get a bit of a run. It is the easiest and oldest trick in the book to make all sorts of allegations in relation to a country's intelligence network knowing that they cannot be responded to and therefore hoping that what you say gets a run, because it cannot be answered. Can I put it in short form for you, though: as I understand it, what you are suggesting is that all calls can be listened to all of the time. What needs to be emphasised is quite simply that calls can be intercepted only under a warrant and that warrants can only be obtained by ASIO for foreign intelligence purposes. If you do not accept that, Senator, there is nothing more I can add other than to refer you back to the provisions of the bill. </para></talk.start><para>Senators have had the benefit of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's review that Senator Ludwig referred to. That committee made a couple of recommendations, which I now want to respond to. The first was a proposition that the bill be reviewed within three years of it coming into effect and that the review have regard to the matters contained in the original reference: the need for new forms of warrant, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of the reporting mechanisms. The government agrees to a review of the operation of the bill as proposed by the committee. It will take place within three years of the bill coming into effect, and it will have regard to the three matters that have just been mentioned.</para><para>The second recommendation was that a note be inserted in the bill to make it clear that proposed section 75A, to be inserted by this bill, would be subject to the general rules of admissibility. I understand from the committee's report that it was concerned that the new provisions may have unintended consequences for the rules of evidence and that the committee wished to ensure that the rights of an accused person and the proper trial process would still be observed. I want to acknowledge that I appreciate those concerns recognised by the committee. However, an existing provision of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act actually achieves the purpose of the committee's recommendation. So I would draw the attention of senators and, in particular, of the committee's members to section 78 of the act, which provides that nothing in part 7 of the act has the effect of making particular interception information admissible as evidence in proceedings to any greater extent than it otherwise would be. Part 7 of the interception act contains extensive and detailed provisions setting out precisely when and how intercepted information might be used. It is the government's view that the provision I have just referred to meets the objective of the committee's second recommendation and that therefore no further action is required.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to highlight that this bill is critically important for law enforcement. Unfortunately, law enforcement and national security agencies have fallen behind in terms of technology development. When criminals are using more sophisticated technology, we need to make sure that our law enforcement agencies and our national security agencies have the most sophisticated and effective investigative tools available. It is, as Senator Ludwig said in his remarks, something that requires a balance between the needs of the agencies and the need for privacy, and we think we have achieved that balance. The already well-established procedural and accountability provisions of the interception act will apply to these new named warrants. I thank senators for their support of the bill.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>14773</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14773</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask the minister whether she could elaborate on the functions of the Geraldton facility and the Waihopai facility near Blenheim in New Zealandâwhat they do and who has access to their information.

Spying for commercial purposes, for example, is way outside what the Australian public or business community believes are the intelligence agencies' permitted functions. I would remind the committee that I was not the origin of this very startling concern that we have moved into an age of telecommunications where all citizens' phone calls are already being spied upon and that the information war between intelligence agencies is now for commercial advantage. I am asking the minister whether this is the case. Is the American intelligence network and their facility near Fort Meade, which has 20,000 people working in it, using information from the Geraldton facility or other facilities in Australia, including information which is of a commercial nature and which is not vetted by the Australian intelligence network? </para></talk.start><para>It is a pretty important matter. All we need is for the minister to stand up and say, `I give you an assurance that the claims made on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program last year are wrong. I give you an assurance that all phone calls are not being scanned by dictionary computers looking for words which will download specific phone calls, Internet communications and faxes for viewing by not just the Australian intelligence network but the intelligence networks of other countries, including the UK and the US.' I would like the minister to give an assurance, because that is what this parliament expects: that the US or anyone else is prohibited from using our facilities to download commercially interesting information which could be used against Australia's interests. We are in the extraordinary situationâif this program is correct, and I believe it isâwhere the facilities in this country and in New Zealand can be used against the national interest.</para><para>The minister has withdrawn at the outset to the totally unwarranted defence of `I can't discuss this matter because it is top secret'. I do not accept that. This is a democracy, and it is important that in a democracy the parliament knows what is going on. The Senate committee was not privy to this information. I do not know of any other committee that is privy to this information. As far as the public knows, there are no guidelines set down by government, by cabinet, by the Prime Minister or by anyone else on these modern spying facilities to protect our nation's interest. The charge here is one of great concern. This is not a frivolous matter, and I dismiss the minister's trivialisation of it. The minister should get up in this chamber and reassure Australians that this very serious development in the international use of our facilities against the national interest is not occurring, cannot occur, will not happen and has not happened. </para><para>On the face of it, it is happening and will happen. If the Canadian arm of this system can intercept phone calls to give Canadian wheat growers the drop on the US wheat growers, what does that say about the future position of Australian wheat growers, who use international communications to ensure that they get the most advantaged position on the world market? Is the Geraldton facility available for the US spying facilities to intercept those phone calls simply by inserting the word `wheat' into the dictionary which downloads all international communications with this country, and transfer them to Fort Meade, where under President Clinton's direction commercial interests are now part of the American intelligence job? Are we in the position where Geraldton, for goodness sake, can be used against the interests of our wheat industry, our wool industry or our manufacturing industries? The program said that this information does flow to the big corporate sector in the US from Fort Meade. The program also said that the Americans have free access to Geraldton and Waihopai in New Zealand and they download their own stuff, which goes straight to Washington, with no intervention by Australia's intelligence network. Sure, Australia downloads its own stuff, but, at least in New Zealand, the list of interests that the US has is longer than that of the New Zealand spy network itself. And that information goes straight to Washington, as I said. Unless we hear otherwise from the government, Australians are being invited to believe that the same situation occurs in this country.  </para><para>I am as concerned about the national interest as anyone else and know that there are matters that the government is not going to want to discuss openly in this chamber because they are mega-critical and sensitive to the national interest and might draw Australia into an embarrassing situation vis-a-vis, for example, spying on embassies, spying on diplomats or spying on members of parliament elsewhere in the world. That is not what this debate is about, or at least it is not what my interest in this debate is. We have gone far beyond that. This is about spying on the whole of the telecommunications network, on everybody's phone calls, and about the use of our facilities by other countries against our own nation's interests. We have gone from the use of intelligence facilities in the national interest to this situation, with the globalisation of world trade interests in particular, of our own spying facilities being used against us. All I want to hear from this minister is that that is not happening, cannot happen and will not happen, and that there are measures in place which prevent that from happening.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIR</name><name role="display">CHAIR</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the bill stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>14775</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSurely this cannot happen.

I point out that I flagged the matters I would raise this morning last night, so that the minister could come in here well prepared to answer my concerns. Instead, she is failing altogether to answer them and is trying to trivialise the matter. I find that totally unsatisfactory. We have a piece of legislation diverting our attention from matters of surveillance of criminal or diplomatic importance. There have been amendments proposed by the Australian office of the Privacy Commissioner and New South Wales legal interests, but the question remains: what about the whole other field that I have brought to the Senate's attention? This is the time to debate it. This is not a matter of spies, security, diplomacy and the protection of the national interest in the way in which Australians think when the name ASIO comes to the fore. I am talking about the interception of everybody's overseas phone calls. I am talking about the use of our facilities against the national interest. I am talking about foreign countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada using our facilities against our interests. All I have asked for is an assurance from the minister that that cannot happen, is not happening and will not happen.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The minister is well aware of the Channel 9 program. I would like her to be able to say that it was fallacious, that the information coming from ex-members of the US intelligence network, from New Zealand and from former Australian operatives is wrong. That program underscored that there are people now working in those networks who feel bad about it. They no longer feel good and that they are working in the interests of their nation. They feel that their whole modus operandi has been diverted into a scramble for commercial interests, which can be very much against the interests of citizens and businesses in the countries in which it is occurring. </para><para>Last night, I mentioned that this Echelon system was used even by former Prime Minister Thatcher to gather information on two ministers in her own cabinet, according to that program. What happened was that, rather than lay open the possibility that it would come to light that this process was under way through the UK arm of this facility being the spying agency, the Canadian arm was brought into play to gather information on two ministers. I guess the Australian government is not going to comment on that. I would like to hear an assurance from our government that no such thing can occur in this country and that no foreign country could use our facilities to spy on citizens, let alone parliamentarians, in such a fashion. The Channel 9 program went on to report how the wife of Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada had been spied onâher calls had been intercepted. The minister is not going to comment on that, as well.</para><para>We are linked up to this Echelon system, established by the United States. Our facility at Geraldton is basic to it and this legislation, if it is put in place, is going to do nothing to change the two basic facts which concern me. All calls are being intercepted and selectively downloaded. Every day, information is going to the United States, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, without that information being recorded or analysed by Australia's intelligence authorities. We know that is not confined to matters of national interest, in the usual sense of those words, but that commercial interests are now becoming predominant in what is downloaded out of this facility.</para><para>I cannot believe that the minister can sit reading the newspaper when she ought to be preparing an answer to the charges I am making. I cannot believe, having been given overnight warning that I would be raising these matters, that the government not only refuses to refute them but sits in silence on the other side. Yes, if you want to stymie a story, say nothing about it. Yes, if you want to downplay the public interest, then refuse to address it. But this is a matter which will lead to a continuing deterioration in the public perception that the parliament is here to defend the rights of Australian citizens. It is not doing that at the moment. This government is selling out on the rights of Australian citizens and businesses.

In many ways, as far as this government is concerned, the bill marks a failure and a loss for the Howard government in relation to local government. It is a mark of failure because the original tax reform package was designed to abolish financial assistance grants to local government. The ANTS package was meant to use the GST to transfer the Commonwealth's responsibility for financial assistance grants to state governments, in the process totally removing the Commonwealth government from any funding responsibility whatsoever for local government. However, at that point the Labor Party, with the assistance of the Democrats, was able to move an amendment in the Senate to the ANTS legislation to ensure that the direct financial link between the Commonwealth and local government was maintained. Subsequent to that amendment, the Democrats and the government struck a deal on the complete GST package, and that nexus remained in relation to that deal. The outcome of this deal is the bill before the Senate today. </para></talk.start><para>The content of this bill deals with a number of issues relating to financial assistance grants. Firstly, it abolishes the old link between financial assistance grants to local government and financial assistance grants to the states. In the past, there was a direct connection between local government grants and financial assistance grants to the states and then to local government. In effect the states were previously a postbox for financial assistance grants. This bill has the effect of changing the nature of that relationship. As financial assistance grants to the states have been abolished as a result of the GST legislation and will cease, as everybody knows, on 1 July this year, the connection between local government financial assistance grants and state financial assistance grants could no longer be maintained. That is the machinery aspect, if you like, in relation to this.</para><para>Secondly, the provision for an escalation factor in this legislation is retained. This escalation factor is an increase on a real per capita basis each year. This is simply a reflection of what has been occurring over the last decade. Local government grants have continued to increase on that basis in line with two major indicators in relation to the escalation factor: inflation and population increase. It is worth noting that the Treasurer still has a discretionary power to vary the escalation factor in special circumstances. This is a bit of a cause for concern and it is something that we will monitor for reasons that I will come to a bit later in my contribution. The assumption is that if the escalation factor is going to be revised, it will obviously, under this government, be revised downwards or be suspended rather than increased. We know from history that this government has no compunction at all in using this power to penalise local government, just as it did in the 1997-98 financial yearâa penalty that has, in fact, cost local government over $61 million since 1997-98. I refer of course to the freezing of the escalation factor in the first Costello budget, which deprived local government of $15 million. That escalation factor and that money have never been returned. The aggregate is currently $61 million in terms of loss to local government. </para><para>Thirdly, the legislation implements a provision in the intergovernmental agreement with respect to the GST package which provides that financial assistance grants to local government may be withheld from any council which refuses to pay voluntary or notional GST payments for which it should be liable. This arises directly from the GST package itself and the need to enforce compliance from the government's perspective upon local government for GST payments. This provision ensures that the part of the IGA that applies to the execution of those GST liabilities is in fact implemented by this legislation.</para><para>They are basically the objectives of the legislation before us today. We are not opposing this bill but we have opposed every piece of legislation that led to this bill. We opposed the ANTS package. We opposed the GST. We opposed it in relation to Australia and also in relation to local government. A number of issues ought to be highlighted in this debate, issues which in turn will highlight the Howard government's real agenda in relation to local government. From our perspective, local government has been abused and ignored by this government. They have every right to feel outraged and they are outraged by the way that they have been treated by this government. It is not good enough for this government to ignore or pay lip service to local communities, particularly in regional areas. Tokenism and rhetoric will not keep communities silent. Saying something is not so will not in fact make it not so. The Orwellian nature of this government and the rhetoric that it uses do not wash in regional Australia.</para><para>I notice Senator Kemp seems to think this is funny. I presume he thought the change of government in Victoria was similarly hilarious and the Benalla by-election was also extremely amusing. Both of those incidences show that the approach does not work. Nobody in regional Australia believes this government and nobody in local government believes this government.</para><para>As I said before, the biggest act of abuse of the local government sector by the Howard government came in the first Costello budget, when financial assistance grants to local government were dealt a major blow by this government. Financial assistance grants were cut by $15 million in that 1997-98 budget. This was never restored. Despite the factâfrom Mr Costello's own lipsâthat there were budget surpluses, this was never restored to local government. As I said previously, this has meant a cut to the local government sector of $61.4 million. If we average that out across every council in Australia, we are talking a cut of $87,000 per council since this government came into power. That is only in relation to financial assistance grants. There are a whole lot of other things in relation to this that I will come to later on. I will bet London to a brick that every council in Australia would be desperate right now to have that money, given the cuts to this sector by this government. It is extremely disappointing, and it is not just disappointing from the Labor Party's position. Local government is very, very disillusioned with this government. If anybody on the other side has the intestinal fortitude to go out and have a chat to any councils, they will get that response. </para><para>Essentially, this reveals the real nature of the coalition government's attitude to local government. It also, from our perspective, serves as a sharp distinction between the coalition and Labor when it comes to local government. The Democrats will obviously contribute later on in the debate. Let us do a quick comparison with what we did for local government in the final years of the Labor government leading up to 1996. It provides a very stark illustration of how this government feels about local government and how Labor feels about local government. Under the Labor government and the direct guidance of Brian Howe, who was the then minister for housing and regional government and who is spoken of extremely highly in local government around Australiaâunlike the current minister, which is an understatementâlocal government was on the verge of entering into a new deal with the federal government. This deal would have left local government far better equipped to face this century than the non-existent policies of the Howard government. That is the best they could be described as. I suspect that they are not just non-existent; they are in fact retrograde.</para><para>During the final years of the Labor government we saw the signing of an accord with the Australian Local Government Association, between local government and the Commonwealth. We saw the establishment of a local government development program designed to provide project assistance across a range of areas that local government has responsibility for. It was $45 million worth, and of course that has hit the wall now. We saw a strong commitment to developing urban and regional Australia in terms of the nexus relationship that inherently exists between those two, through the Building Better Cities program, a program which went not just to cities but to provincial and regional areas. I was extremely interested to notice that the now minister's home town of Townsville recently got the remainder of some Better Cities money in relation to projects in Townsville. Better Cities was not simply citiesâit was also regional.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âWhy was it called Better Cities, then?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âThe reason it was called Better Cities was because cities are not just Melbourne and Sydney.

What have we seen in relation to the local government development program? We saw the wholesale abolition of the entire regional development programânot just the local government program, but the entire regional development program. The first thing this government did was to abolish that under the then Minister Sharp, who is famous for saying, `Federal government has no constitutional role in regional development', something which this government is now attempting to pretend that it did not say. But nobody has repudiated former Minister Sharp's comment on that. </para></talk.start></continue><para>This government has vacated the urban policy field entirely. This government's own back bench is now starting to scream about the lack of action on urban policy. This government thinks regional means ruralânot regional in the way most Australians understand it. The abolition of this program is, from our perspective, typical of the mean-spirited and shortsighted approach of this government to local government, to urban communities and to regional communities. This mean-spirited and, from Senator Kemp's perspective, risible attitude towards regional Australia and local government has had an impact in this sector. </para><para>The 1988 referendum on the constitutional recognition of local government is the most damning example. The Labor Party attempted to enshrine the role of local government in the Constitution in the 1988 referendum. This was torpedoed byâguess who? It was Minister ReithâJust Say No Reith. Despite the fact that the Labor Party attempted to enshrine constitutional recognition of local government in the Constitution and failed, we retain it in our platform and we retain it as a policy. We will at the appropriate time ensure it. I am sure that at that point we will have Mr Just Say No Reith trying to torpedo it yet again. Peter Reith singlehandedly sank local government's opportunity for constitutional recognition. </para><para>Labor is also committed to a partnership with local government built on a common vision, not on imposing large cuts on financial assistance grants to local government. The challenge for any government is to listen to local communities and develop policies that address the issues in a direct and efficient manner. This is a challenge that this government has no intention whatsoever of taking up, but we are interested in this challenge. We have been in the past and we will be in the future. We believe that all three spheres of government must work together. We empirically attempted to enshrine processes which would make sure that happened through the setting up of COAG, something we have not yet seen since this government came to power in 1996. COAG, for the benefit of those opposite in their ignorance, is where local government sits at the table with the other two levels of government. We have not seen COAG at all. Labor pledged to restore the role of COAG and to restore the role of local government as an equal partner in governance in Australia. </para><para>Since I was appointed to the shadow ministry I have spoken to a large number of councils right throughout Australia as well as to regional organisations and so on. One thing is crystal clear. This partnership needs to be re-established, something that local government correctly says will establish security to their operations. Something which this government will not accept is that councils are not simply a creature of the states. Be they in urban, rural, remote or regional areas, they are at the centre of their communities. </para><para>Local government is the level of government which is closest to the people. If you are a councillor, which many in this chamber have been, and you are out there representing your constituencyâSenator Calvert has been; I agreeâyou get questions about everything. You get questions about local government, you get questions about state governments and you get questions about federal government. You are the major interface, as a local councillor, between the community and government and the closest to the community. I might exempt Senator Calvertâbecause I know that Senator Calvert does have an appreciation and a commitment to local governmentâfrom my criticism of the federal government. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âI am the only federal politician on the eastern shore.

This is thanks to the efforts of Senator Calvert and his esteemed colleague Senator Abetz, who we are hoping and praying gets the ministerial spot. The day that happens and Senator Abetz comes to the front bench there will be a party in the Labor Party headquarters. I will not digress any further. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Local government must be seen as a partner. Recently I made a speech to WSROC in Sydney in which I outlined the nature of regions. I will not repeat that, other than to say that regions are not just rural; regions are urban, regions are outer metro, regions are suburban, regions are provincial cities and regions are rural. Since the election of the Howard government nothing has happened. A classic example of the government's disregard can be seen in the delayed payment of FAGs moneys last year. This caused all kinds of difficulties for local government. The ALGA has estimated that it cost the states and local government approximately $500,000 a week. This is the kind of uncertainty local government does not need. </para><para>The impact of the GST is something which I will touch on very briefly. The minister for local government was gracious enough to offer local government a measly $2,000 each to handle the implementation of the GSTâ$2,000 per council. We discovered in the Senate recently that the LGIP program had been underspent by $1 million. So the measly $2,000 could have been a measly $4,000 but it was underspent by $1 million. Anybody who goes out and talks to councils will tell you very sad stories about the cost of implementation of the GST. This is another issue that local government are very angry about. </para><para>Local government are also very angry about the broken promise. Prior to the election, the New South Wales Local Government Association wrote to the Prime Minister and said, `What is the status of the GST in relation to local government?' Lynton Crosby wrote back on behalf of the Prime Minister and said, `You are exempt.' What was the first thing that happened after the election? Senator Macdonald said, `Lynton Crosby was wrong. We are reneging on that. We are breaking that promise.' This is an example of this government's real agenda in relation to local government. This is in stark contrast to our agenda in relation to local government. I will say this to the government and the members sitting opposite: local government know it; they know what this government has done to that sector; they are not happy, irrespective of whether they be Labor councils or National Party councils, in particular. We are committed to local government. We have been in the past, and we will be in the future.

It was in fact only roughly this time last year when I was still at the town of Vincent and making decisions for them. That was a great learning curve in terms of working with an identifiable constituency with identifiable borders; it is so much more amorphous when you are trying to represent an entire state. So, as with Senator CalvertâI am not quite sure of Senator Mackay's backgroundâI have enjoyed that local government background. </para></talk.start><para>Yes, I agree with you, Senator Mackay. I was at Murdoch University in my final year in 1988 as a student activist and a member of the student guild. I was very involved in the `Yes, yes, yes, yes' campaign referendum, handing out how-to-vote cards at Cockburn Primary School on the day, only to see the vote come in as `No, no, no' at the end of the night, which was very disappointing, particularly for the potential to officially recognise local government within the Constitution.</para><para>My initial interest in local government began when I was living in North Perth some years ago. A decision was taken at the then Perth City Council to oppose a planning application for a daytime drop-in centre for people living with AIDS. That decision came down to the wire in terms of the numbers on Perth City Council and, ultimately, that proposal was defeated by one vote. It was made very clear to meâand there was a lot of media on that at the timeâthat the decision was a particularly appalling decision because a number of councillors said disgusting and repugnant things, particularly about gay men but also about people living with AIDS. Many councillors were mortified that this decision was defeated in the way that it was. One particular councillor at that time, Mr Peter Nattrass, leaned very heavily on his medical backgroundâhe is a gynaecologistâclaiming in part and arguing amongst other thingsâI understand that he had some expertise with the issue of HIV-AIDSâthat, if this drop-in centre were to go ahead, the streets would become littered with syringes, and that, if tissues were to blow over the fence into the surrounding neighbourhood, children could become infected with AIDS.</para><para>This particular misleading, untruthful and disingenuous argument was taken very seriously by the people who were lodging that particular planning application, People Living With AIDS (WA). They lodged a complaint of discrimination with the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission. At about the same time, the then state Minister for Local Government, Mrs Kay Hallahan, overturned that decision and allowed the drop-in centre for people living with AIDS to go ahead. As it happened, the investigation by the Equal Opportunity Commission concluded some months later in the affirmativeâthat is, the decision of the Equal Opportunity Commission upheld the claim of discrimination by People Living With AIDS. This case could have been heard under Western Australian jurisdiction in terms of grounds of impairment, which is covered under the state Equal Opportunity Act, whereas sexuality is not. I remind the Senate that Western Australia remains the only state where it remains legal to discriminate against gay and lesbian people in employment, housing and the provision of goods and services.</para><para>Those people on the council, including Dr Nattrass, who were found to have discriminated wrongly were reprimanded and fined. My recollection is that individual councillors were fined between $4,000 and $8,000. I do not recall whether that was a specific individual fine or a collective fine for those people found guilty of discrimination. Not letting it stand there, those councillors decided that they would not accept that and, quite shockingly I think, they then appealed to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, arguing that that decision was wrong and that the Equal Opportunity Commission was wrong to have found in that manner.</para><para>That case took some time, as these cases generally do in the Supreme Court, and my recollection is that ultimately the Supreme Court found in favour of the Equal Opportunity Commission, cementing the original decision that discrimination had occurred. But that was not enough for those councillors, including Dr Nattrass, who then took the matter to the Supreme Court. Of course, during all the time, people living with AIDS, their organisation and their commitment to servicing that community were placed in confusion in terms of their relocation as to where they were supposed to be, as well as the extraordinary time and money consumed in responding to that case. The Supreme Court found in that case on a legal technicality only that the original decision from the Equal Opportunity Commission in WA ought not apply on the basis that a planning decision by a local government authority could not be deemed a good or a service and, as such, the Equal Opportunity Commission had no jurisdiction over that.  </para><para>That was a spark of unprecedented public anti-gay hysteria, the likes of which we had not seen in Western Australia for some years. Then we come around to May 1995. Acting Deputy President McKiernan, you may recall that that was the time of the inaugural elections for four new councils within Western Australia, including the town of Vincent to which I was elected along with my friend and colleague, now Mayor of Vincent, John Hyde, with whom you would be familiar. Things were going well in the town of Vincent when I woke up one morning to find on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper the now Lord Mayor of the City of Perth describing Councillor John Hyde and me as `disgusting poofters who controlled Vincent'. This was a stunning revelation, given that I had never metâor spoken toâDr Nattrass, and I understand the same is true of my colleague Mayor Hyde. </para><para>At that time I was particularly concerned about what that meant in terms of public leadership from the City of Perth and also what that meant in terms of the complete absence in Western Australia of antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of sexuality. We now see that that has evolved into an even greater alarming trend. As it happens, there is now a by-election in the City of Perth where, for the first time ever in WA, as I understand it, an enclosure is going to be inserted into the postal ballot for the electors of the City of Perth asking them whether or not they approve of the Lesbian and Gay Pride parade. This is a parade now in its 11th year which last year attracted between 70,000 and 100,000 citizens from Western Australia into the City of Perth and surrounding Northbridge area. It is a festival which the Northbridge traders argue brings in in excess of $1 million on that particular night. It is a festival that the police service which regulate that particular festival claim is one of the safest and friendliest nights of the year. It brings in an estimated $750,000 in parking fees alone. Yet, when the Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee approached the City of Perth for a humbleâI think, quite patheticâ$13,500 in funding, Dr Nattrass not only said no but also gave a speech in the chamber which I would argue verged on vilification. Had he made the very same speech about Aboriginal people or Jewish people, in all likelihood he could have been prosecuted or at least charged under Western Australian incitement to hatred antivilification laws. The summary of all this is that there is a responsibility on those people in public office to be fair and to be reasonable. There is also the obligation to ensure that there is a duty of care in terms of funding through local government. </para><para>Senator Mackay was quite right in saying that it was the Democrats who supported Labor and vice versa in terms of ensuring, at the other end of the ANTS package in June of last year, that ultimate funding responsibility for local government authorities remained with the Commonwealth. I think a part of the reasoning for that is that there is in some quarters a sense of mistrust about how state governments allocate particular funding sources to their local government authorities and a genuine fear on the part of some people that there is often political favouritism or political punishment in those kinds of funding applications. As the minister said in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives and to summarise, the core of this amendment bill before us is that, under the revised tax reform packageâthat is, revised following the intervention of the Democratsâthe Commonwealth will retain, quite rightly, I believe, responsibility for providing financial assistance grants to local government. It is therefore necessary to amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 to remove that connection with the states' financial agreements grants, as those will be abolished from 1 July 2000âjust some 20-odd days awayâas a result of the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. Of course, a key feature of that agreement is the payment of all GST revenue to the states. This amendment allows that local government financial assistance grants will be maintained on a real per capita basis. So, in essence, this is a stand-alone provision so that local government grants can escalate on a real per capita basis. Clearly, the urgency to pass the legislation is rooted in the fact that it is now necessary to pass this in order to ensure that the federal government is able to make those payments available to local government authorities after 1 July this year, which as I said is just a matter of days away. </para><para>My experience and anecdotal evidence in dealing and maintaining a liaison, as I do, with local government authorities and councillors is that there is a general agreement that the ANTS package is good for local government. I have encountered no valid opposition to that. I find that most local government councillors are looking forward to the new funding arrangement and the opportunities that it provides. The information I received from the department yesterday on the budget estimates for 2000-01 for the local government federal agreement grants is that local governments will receive some $1.32 billion in local government assistance grants in the 2000-01 budgetâan increase of four per cent or $50.85 million from an estimated final entitlement of around $1.271 billion in 1999-2000. Of the $1.32 billion, approximately $915.8 million is for general purpose grants and some $406.4 million for local roads grants. The four per cent increase comprises a population increase factor of 1.25 per cent and a CPI factor of 2.75 per cent. The CPI element of the adjustment factor to apply to local government financial assistance grants for 2000-01 excludes the impact of indirect tax reform, including the GST. This approach is similar to that being taken in relation to other specific purpose payments to the states. The adjusted CPI of 5.5 per cent measures prices rises to consumers who cannot claim input tax credits. As local government can claim input tax credits, the increase in funding through the CPI element reflects that. </para><para>In summary, the Democrats support this bill. We support the ethos of the particular funding arrangements remaining principally with the Commonwealth. I also made the particular point in my second reading contribution that those of us in public office have a duty of care to administer those funds, when sought by individuals and community groups, on a fair basisâwithout fear or favour. The vilification we have seen in Western Australia is unreasonable and unacceptable but can continue because of the lack of antidiscrimination laws within that state. Once again, this brings home the very strong argumentâthat the Democrats have supported since 1995âfor the passage of legislation through this chamber and the House of Representatives to ensure national antidiscrimination laws on the grounds of sexuality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>14783</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1005">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000</inline>. I will highlight a number of concerns with this legislation and place on record the inequity which exists in the distribution of funding for local government, particularly in my electorate of the Northern Territory. The debate on this legislation provides me with an opportunity to address the issue of funding cuts the government has made through the financial assistance grantsâor FAGs as they are known in the industryâto local government since it first came to office.</para></talk.start><para>The real essence of this bill is the intent to terminate the 25-year Commonwealth-local government funding partnership by transferring responsibility for local government financial assistance grants funding to the states. In May 1984, following a national inquiry into local government finance, the Hawke government abandoned the tax sharing arrangements of the Fraser government and introduced the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act in 1986. The key feature of this act was that growth of local government general revenue funding was tied to growth in general purpose funding to the states. This linkage was retained in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995, the legislation under which the Commonwealth now provides for local government financial assistance and road grants. The formula is based on the annual increase in state financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance. Since 1994-95, the state grantsâand, hence, grants to local governmentâhave increased annually in line with population and CPI movements. Under the 1995 act, local government should receive around $1.32 billion in financial assistance grants in 2000-01. This bill breaks the link between the local government financial assistance grants and state financial assistance grants. From 1 July this year, the Commonwealth will cease paying financial assistance grants to the states and will replace them with the revenue from the GST. Consequently, the link between local government assistance and general revenue assistance to the states will be severed. </para><para>This bill also provides me with an opportunity to highlight the failure to exempt local government services from the GST, which this government promised before the 1998 election, only to renege on this commitment within months of regaining office. The GST is the imposition of a regressive and unfair tax on essential services provided by local government to communities in regional Australia, and local councils now have to contend with major GST compliance costs, with inadequate compensation or assistance from this government. We will recall that, in the budget this year, an amount averaged out at only $2,000 per local council has been provided to assist in the implementation of this new tax.</para><para>At the beginning of May, the Darwin City Council announced that 270 fees and charges would be affected by the GST. These include: cemetery charges, car parking charges, hire of ovals, library fees, pool entry fees and community centre chargesâto name but a few. This situation is the same for each and every town council in the Territory. It is unfortunate the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government has not been honest with local governments. He claimed that no council would be forced to increase rates or to cut services as a result of the GST. It is now known that most medium-sized councils are facing GST bills of more than $150,000, but this government fails to comprehend that, if services bring in increased costs, it is likely that fewer people will use these services and councils will be forced in future to reassess the level of services being offered in the community. Further, with councils looking at massive GST compliance bills, these will have to be recouped in some aspect of their business. Surely it will be passed on to the ratepayer and, as a consequence of the GST, an increase in rates and garbage collection will follow.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to highlight a very important issue which impacts very severely on local governments in the Northern Territory. It goes to the method of funding and why there should be a review of the way in which the Commonwealth provides these funds to state and territory governments for the allocation of local government purposes. The states grants commissions determine the intrastate distribution of both these payments to local governments. Distributions must be made in accordance with the national principles, which require that grants be allocated as a minimum grant to all councilsâthat not less than 30 per cent of the total funds be distributed on an equal per capita basis, the remainder being on the basis of horizontal equalisation and effort neutrality; that individual council policies should not influence their grants; that the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are recognised; that account is taken of other grant support received by local councils, such as through specific purpose payments; and, that the identified road component should be allocated on the basis of relative needs of councils for expenditure on roads and to preserve road assets.</para><para>The interstate distribution on an equal per capita basis and application of these principles means that the distribution of Commonwealth grants to local government does not achieve horizontal fiscal equalisation among local councils across Australia, or within any one state. Work undertaken by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1991 suggested that a distribution very different from equal per capita would be required if state grants were allocated on the basis of fiscal equalisation principles. The guaranteed minimum grant means that equalisation within a state cannot be achieved because councils with no relative need or with more revenue than they need to fund standard service provisions receive funding. As a result, the needs of other councils cannot be met and they are not funded to enable them to provide standard services. </para><para>The funding arrangements require that once these funds are received by the states, whilst they have a minimum, they use the fundamental principle of fiscal equalisation in the distribution. Yet when the Commonwealth makes funding available to state and territory governments for distribution to local governments they are not required to use the same principle. Of course, other Commonwealth grants are. All general revenue assistance made available as a result of Grants Commission recommendations is based on this question of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This means that all states and territories are then given resources to provide a similar standard of service for their citizens so that they are roughly equitable across Australia. This is not the case for local government. </para><para>I am aware of a letter written by Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald in his capacity as Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government to the President of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory. The letter is, effectively, a form letter in which he informs the associationâas he is required to do, he says, under section 17 of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Actâthat a review of the act will be undertaken before 30 June 2001. He points out that section 17 of the act specifies that some areas must be covered by a review. The act also requires him to review other matters relating to local government that he may determine. He points out that he has drafted terms of reference, which followed discussions between his department and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Before finalising the terms of reference, he sent copies to the respective state and territory ministers. He points out that the review is to commence soon, as he wants comments by 3 May 2000. I would like to quote the following paragraph of his letter for the record: </para><quote><para>I am conscious that some in Local Government would have liked wider terms of reference to allow a review of the interstate distribution of fundingâ</para></quote><para>so he knows it is out thereâ</para><quote><para>I am also aware that there are some that do not want the interstate distribution reviewed at allâ</para></quote><para>of course, we all know the conflict occurring between the major capital cities and local government in places like the Northern Territoryâ</para><quote><para>This has been a contentious issue between States for some timeâ</para></quote><para>that is correctâ</para><quote><para>and was extensively debated as part of the negotiations over the 1999 Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations. The Federal Government does not support re-examining this matter as part of this review. For those Councils or Associations wishing to pursue this matter I suggest you approach your State Government for appropriate attention.</para></quote><para>That is a most unfortunate response, and I believe it shows that the minister is either not aware of the inequities that occur as a result of this funding, although the response in the letter does not seem to lead us to believe that, or not prepared to tackle and confront the wrath of the major councils in the eastern states if this review was in fact undertaken. The President of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory, Margaret Vigants, responded to the minister's letter on 3 May 2000. She said:</para><quote><para>You have advised in your letter of 17 April 2000 that the review is âan important part of the Government's desire to enhance equity between councilsâ. In view of this objective, Minister, we would ask that before you approve the final terms of reference for the review, you examine the equity issues associated with the current funding levels councils in the Northern Territory receive under this act.</para></quote><para>There are 69 councils in the Northern Territory under various forms of local governance. They include metropolitan councils such as the Darwin City Council, the Alice Springs Town Council, the Katherine Town Council, the Tennant Creek Town Council and others. They also include a number of community government councils, which are government councils under the specific legislation in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal communities. They also include incorporated Aboriginal communities and organisations that carry out local government services in Aboriginal communities around the Northern Territory. This is an important feature because local government in the Northern Territory does not share the same attributes as local governments elsewhere in Australia. One example is that they do not have any defined boundaries in remote parts of the Northern Territory, nor do they share the same responsibilities. Their responsibilities are different. What Mrs Vigants has done is provide some information to the minister on the way in which grants are made available to the Northern Territory and what impact that has. </para><para>You need to know that grants to states and territories are done on a per capita basis of around $44 per person. As a result, because it is per capita, there is no allowance for remoteness, no allowance for disability factors and no allowance for the other issues that are raised when we distribute the funds on the fundamental principles of fiscal equalisation. The fundamental issue is that, because grants are made on a per capita basis, states with a larger population base get a greater amount of funds to distribute around the state to remote areas. This is significant when you actually compare the figures on a state by state basis. In the case of Queensland, for example, the Brisbane City Council is eligible for $38 million per year on a per capita basis but, because of the size of the base in Queensland and the way in which the Queensland government properly distributes those funds, it receives only $12 million, and the rest is distributed amongst other councils. The Northern Territory gets a total of $9 million. Of this, the Darwin City Council gets around $2.6 million, so there is not enough money left to spread around to remote communities on the basis of remoteness and the nature of the services they provide.</para><para>As a comparison of how funds are distributed across Australia for towns with approximately the same populationâas outlined in the 1997-98 local government national report that I have with me hereâKatherine received $849,000, which includes the general purpose and roads funding money; whereas Charters Towers, of roughly the same population, received $1.1 million. Similarly, Alice Springs was allocated $1.5 million but Mitchell in Victoria received $3.2 million, and it has the same population base. The following example is fairly amazing: Peppimenarti, which is an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory that has a population of 260, got $216,000 but Upper Gascoyne, which is a shire in Western Australia with 261 people, on the basis of this reportâso that is one person moreâreceived nearly $1.016 million. So, on the basis of one additional person, they got an additional $800,000. It is the same with Numbulwar in the Northern Territory. They received $245,000, but if you go to Jericho in Queensland, which has the same population base, they got $1.1 million, and Richmond in Queensland got $1.3 million. Port Keats, an Aboriginal community to the west of Darwin, got $200,000, with a population of almost 2,000; Barcaldine in Queensland, a town of an equivalent size, received $1.2 million.</para><para>You can see the obvious disparity which results from the way in which the funds are made available. Aboriginal communities get an operational subsidy from the Northern Territory Grants Commission because, significantly, they have no rates base. This is true of most of the local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, apart from the metropolitan councils. They do not have a rates base and they get short-changed in the distribution of funds, because they are distributed unfairly.</para><para>The letter from the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory compared the average funding for councils in the Northern Territory with the average for all other states in each of the categories for the 1998-99 year. To provide you with a quick example, the urban council in the capital city, Darwin, receives $1.3 million. The average grant paid to other councils in other states is $2.3 million. Where you have a small, remote council, of which there are 23 in the Territory, the average grant paid to councils is about $75,500, but in other states it is over $500,000. </para><para>As the President of the Local Government Association in the Northern Territory says: </para><quote><para>With the loss of this magnitude being experienced each year by Northern Territory councils as a specific outcome of this Act, we regard this as a complete failure to distribute funding on a fair and equitable basis. </para></quote><para>In the context of local government, this government has a responsibility, I believe, to examine the equity issues associated with the funding which councils in the Northern Territory receive under this act. One of the major deficiencies is that the funding, which is not made available as a result of the formula to organisations and remote communities which carry out local government functions, is inequitable. If this government truly represents regional Australia, then this major issue will be addressed.</para><para>We have heard the minister brag in this chamber about his regional and northern consultations. You should be aware, Minister Macdonald, that the minute people leave your consultations and step outside the room, they are not impressed with your performance. They believe they are being used and that your efforts are not genuine. I would say to you: keep traipsing around northern Australia. You assist our campaign greatly when you talk about issues to do with regional governments. In fact, I think one quote from your meeting in Katherine was: `I'm here to listen but let me tell you there will not be one more dollarânot today, not next week, not even next year.' People were quite impressed with that statement in Katherine.</para><para>This is a major issue which is not being addressed, and the minister has determined that it will not be addressed in the review of the local government act. I note that in the letter from Mrs Vigants, she says:</para><quote><para>Your specific exclusion of consideration of the interstate distribution of funds will not allow this review to genuinely achieve a more equitable outcome of funds to councils across Australia.</para></quote><para>This bill also goes to the matter of road funding. I do not have the time to go through, in detail, local road funding in the Northern Territory, but it is a major issue. Put yourself in the situation of these small councils which might have 50, 100 or 200 people in remote communities and they are 200 or 300 kilometres away from another community. The local road funding they receive is based on a population of people living together in a very isolated place. The difficulty is that neither this government nor the Northern Territory government has accepted any responsibility for providing the necessary funds for transport infrastructureâthe roads that link these communities. That is an abrogation of responsibility and, again, the way in which these local government funds are made available should be addressed; or, more specifically, the government should make available a suitable pool of funds for these purposes.</para><para>The identified local road grants have received no additional funding beyond the per capita funding and CPI indexes. The Local Government Association of the Northern Territory has said, `There are also major equity issues with the interstate distribution of local road grants, and the draft terms of reference for the review do not allow obvious road funding inequities to be revised.'</para><para>This bill is the legacy of the government's attempts to shift all responsibility for local government funding to state and territory governments. It will fundamentally change the role of state governments in relation to local government. It is about time this government was serious about addressing the issues being raised by local government and people in rural and remote Australia. It is about time this government stopped window-dressing its approach to rural and remote Australia by taking travelling roadshows out bush but, at the end of the day, doing nothing and ignoring the concerns that are being raisedâparticularly by people in local government in the Northern Territory.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>14787</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1005">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000</inline> and take the opportunity to discuss how the GST will affect councils and the communities they serve.</para></talk.start><para>Looking at the impact of the GST on local councils really drives home how insidious this new tax is.

Do we really need to explain to the government how important local halls are? Should we really have to explain how bad it is that not only will there be a tax on the books people buy but it will also be on any library services local governments charge for? I suppose we do have to explain all of these things because from 1 July the federal government will be making Australians pay more for these services. Some of them might not mean very much on their own but together they play a vital role in many communities, particularly small communities. Many of these services would not exist in rural and regional areas if it were not for the local council. Many of these services are not viable commercial activities in small regional areas: they simply do not make a profit. Make no mistake: when the federal government decided to tax these services, it was not just attacking local councils; it was attacking regional and rural Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are not talking about the odd fee here and an extra levy there. The Local Government Association of Queensland conducted a study for the Logan City Council which indicated that more than 260 of its charges could be subject to the GST. The Ipswich City Council is going to be hit very hard by this GST. Figures that have come from the chairman of the council's Finance Committee, Councillor Paul Tully, show how serious the situation is. The one-off cost of implementation of the GST for the Ipswich City Council is $200,000. That amount includes lost staff time. Since July last year, one staff member has been diverted from other duties to oversee the implementation of the GST. There are currently four staff working on the GST full time. The ongoing costs of GST implementation for the Ipswich City Council are estimated at $100,000 a year. The council also estimates that it will lose about $20,000 a year from lost revenue. That lost revenue comes from things such as parking meters and photocopying machines that have a fixed coinage charge, which are too expensive to change. Every time someone puts a dollar into a parking meter, the Ipswich City Council will pay 9c to the government, so by this time next year the ratepayers of Ipswich City Council will be $320,000 out of pocket. That is $320,000 that could have been spent on roads, $320,000 that could have been spent on parks and $320,000 that could have been spent on books for our libraries and other services that they provide. </para><para>Councils will now have to include a 10 per cent GST in the price of these services. They are not commercially viable so councils will have to decide whether they will increase these fees and charges by 10 per centâand take the risk of putting the price above the level the community can affordâor subsidise the GST increase out of their rates base. Whichever way you look at it, local communities will be the big losers. These services provided by the local councils were never designed to make a profit. The charges were levied by councils to help cover the costs of these valuable services but rarely did they actually cover those costs so, in reality, the rates residents pay to their local council subsidise these activities, sometimes quite heavily. Of course, the councils are particularly upset about this because they were originally told these things would not be a problem at all. In the 1998 election campaign the government promised local government authorities that the non-commercial activities of councils for which a nominal fee was charged would be GST free. That made sense at the time because the services had a large community service, non-profit element. The advice was given to local government authorities through a letter written by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynton Crosby, on behalf of the Prime Minister. The letter stated: </para><quote><para>The non-commercial activities of government will be outside the scope of the GST. This means that where a service is provided free of charge, or for a nominal charge, the GST will not apply.</para></quote><para>That gave local government authorities a bit of reassurance. Having been assured by the head of the Liberal Party in Australia, they felt reasonably confident that the community services they offered their local constituents would not be taxed by the GSTâand so did the Australian communityâbut they had been misled. Then, less than six months later, they found out the whole thing was a sham. At a Senate estimates hearing last year, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, revealed the truth. He told Senator Mackay: </para><quote><para>I am awareâand I guess you are coming on to this; perhaps I can pre-empt this long tortuous processâthere is a letter from the Liberal Party campaign office prior to the election suggesting that nominal charges would be exempt. That is not correct. To all intents and purposes it is correct, because if the nominal charge is 10 cents the GST will be 1 cent. But it is on the charge that is made.</para></quote><para>That is what Senator Macdonald said. So, from that statement by the minister, one would surmise that it was clear that the government was going to define all the activities of local government for which a small fee or charge was levied as commercial. The government either missed the point entirely or chose to simply ignore that these activities are community servicesâservices which are very heavily subsidised by ratepayers; services vital to the community which are not attractive to the private sector. The current government has shown again and again its ignorance of the importance of local government. This government has cut financial assistance grants to local government in real terms since it came to office. It has attempted to terminate the 25-year Commonwealth-local government funding partnership by trying to transfer the responsibility for local government financial assistance grants to the states. The government has also hit councils with major GST compliance costs but has provided inadequate compensation or assistance. On several occasions Senator Ian Macdonald told us how much local councils were looking forward to the GST. In question time on 26 November 1998, Senator Ian Macdonald said:</para><quote><para>Local government is keen on the GST and the tax reform agenda of this government. </para></quote><para>During estimates last year, Senator Ian Macdonald said that local governments understood the GST and were very positive about its introduction.

Some service fees will rise at least 10 per cent due to the introduction of the GST but the Federal Government is yet to determine exactly which fees will attract the consumption tax. But coupled with the GST is a push towards the `user pays' concept for council services. Fearing public outrage, councillors gave the cost recovery principle a cold shoulder last week but stopped short of ruling it out altogether. A decision has been delayed until June 7, when a more detailed report will be considered.</para><para>A preliminary report at last week's council meeting claimed all current fees would have to be increased to ensure cost-recovery on services. But councillor Llew Davies said he thought council could not justify heavy increases. `Everyone hates the GST already and for us to double that impact is not going to make us any more popular,' he said. Other councillors agreed and refused to push approval for fee adjustments despite tight time constraints. Administration co-ordinator Tony Vaccaro explained cost recovery meant some fees would rise by 10 per cent which, when combined with the GST, meant the increases could add up to 20 per cent.</para></quote><para>Get out your calculator, Senator. It continues:</para><quote><para>`But it would not be a blanket 10 per cent increase. There would be some that rise by only seven per cent,' he said.</para></quote><para>So there you have it: `Everyone hates the GST'. And that is from the very same council that the minister served on. Whatever you make of the arguments expressed in that article about cost recovery, there can be no doubt that the minister's claim that councils love this new tax is an absolute furphy.</para><para>But the impact of the GST on regional communities is not confined simply to local councils. Earlier this year I spoke on how the GST would impact on agricultural show societies. That situation needs looking at again. When I raised it, Assistant Treasurer Senator Kemp ridiculed me and said that I did not understand the implementation of the GST. However, on advice from the tax office, I can say that it will affect every small show society in Australia. These show societies will now have to pay GST on donated trophies, complimentary passes, sponsorships, gate entry fees, memberships, site fees and sideshow ground rent. They will also have to pay GST on the competitions that they run. So not only will the people in regional and rural communities have to pay the GST when they go to hire out a local hall or swim in the town pool, they will also have to pay the GST when they go to their local show. They are going to be hit from every side by this tax. I expect that Senator Ian Macdonald will stand up and tell us that local governments will not need to raise their prices for these services because they will enjoy savings in a range of areas. Senator Ian Macdonald has already cited the reduction in fuel costs and the removal of wholesale sales tax as potential areas of savings. Considering the blow-out in petrol costs over the last few monthsâand everybody has felt thatâI do not see how anyone can now reasonably claim that petrol will be cheaper after 1 July. It just will not happen. </para><para>The opposition are not opposed to this legislation. Indeed, we are pleased that the government will continue direct Commonwealth assistance to local government, although under the original GST package this was not the case. Unfortunately, there are a few things the bill has not done. The first is that the legislation has not restored the $15 million that the government cut in 1997. It is also worth noting that there is no real provision for any substantial support for local government with respect to the costs of implementing this new tax. For most medium-sized councils, the cost of upgrading their computers and training their staff for the GST is about $100,000. The Local Government Association of Queensland has estimated that their members will spend $7 million implementing the GST. That $7 million has to come from somebody, and it will probably come from ratepayers. At present the government has allocated less than half that amount nationally. </para><para>The government tell us that after 1 July everything will be fine. They tell us that every Australian will be better off after 1 July. I do not think they are looking very hard, because every Australian out there knows that they are not going to be better off after 1 July. The government do not seem to have any idea that this tax is completely unfair and will hit regional and rural Australia much harder than it will hit the big cities. This is just another example of how the government are all talk and no action when it comes to the issues affecting regional and rural Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>14791</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the outset let me compliment Senator Gibbs on her excellent contribution on the <inline ref="R1005">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000</inline>. The content was so detailed that it has probably enabled me to shorten my comments in this debate. Senator Gibbs has detailed very well the real impost that is going to impact upon local government when the GST cuts in in July. The minister is not yet in the chamber but I understand he is going to grace us with his presence for once and participate in this debate. This minister and this government have no idea about the problems that local government is facing and is going to face with the introduction of the GST. </para></talk.start><para>In her excellent speech, Senator Gibbs pointed to some of the comments that have been made by Senator Ian Macdonald regarding the GST and his claims that it will be of huge benefit and that he really does not have any concerns, and does not believe that local government has any concerns, about the GST. If you have ever had the torturous experience of having to sit in estimates hearings with Senator Ian Macdonald, you will know that he continually refuses to answer questions but nevertheless wants to give us the benefit of his wisdom on any number of subjects. When asked specific questions, he either refuses to answer them or, if he does not know the answer, invariably refuses to even take them on notice. Senator McGauran and Senator Mackay will recall that at the recent estimates hearings on 25 May it even got to the stage where Senator Macdonald was having an open dispute with officers of his own department about information and answers to questions that they were giving to us in those proceedings. Invariably it was Senator Macdonald sitting there saying to his departmental officers, `Look, I don't know, but I think you're wrong.' That was the tenor of his contribution. </para><para>I will quote from the estimates <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 25 May in respect of this issue of the impact of the GST upon local councils and what information this government and this minister have about that issue.

Local government is an incredibly important aspect of the levels of government in this country. For many people it is essentially the area of government that they have most contact with. Senator Gibbs and Senator Mackay in their contributions pointed to the range of services that local governments around Australia provide. As federal members of parliament, we knowâindeed, state members of parliament knowâthat when people need to approach government in their day-to-day lives, very often the particular issues of concern are local issues: roads, provision of community services and so on. </para><para>You would think that the government would regard it as an obligation, as a priority, to go out and ascertain the impact of the GST on local government. Of course they have not done that and they do not intend to do it. Why? It is all based upon this belief that they have, and they continue to believe it because they have to. They know, if they are not correct, that the consequences for them at the next election will be catastrophic. They continue to have blind faith in the view that the GST will be of benefit to everybody. Treasury has told us that and Mr Costello has told us that, so they do not have to even investigate that premise any more. This has occurred right through all the departments. Whenever any senator has attempted to ask questions in estimates hearings about what a particular department have done with respect to the implementation and application of a GST in their area, they say, `It's not our business. We have not done anything.' If you talk to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, where the GST will have a huge impact right across the portfolio areas, they say, `No, we haven't done any work on it.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âRegional?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âTransport and Regional Services particularly say, `No, we haven't done any work. That's all Treasury and the department of finance. Let them worry about it.' This is an incredible attitude but one we are not surprised at, because it demonstrates the arrogance of the government. When he came to office, Mr Howard claimed he was going to set new standards, he was not going to break any promises and he was going to remain true to his word. He is on the record as having broken one of the most solemn promises ever made in an election campaign. Remember `there will be no GST'? He broke that promise and it is going to cost him dearly at the next election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In respect of local government in particular, which is what this legislation is directed at, I have to compliment the previous speaker, Senator Gibbs. She drew attention to the commitment given by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party that the GST would not apply on non-commercial activitiesâall those many services that Senator Gibbs read out. But Senator Macdonald, having a flash of insight, said one day at a hearing, `Mr Crosby is wrong. Don't believe what he tells you. Don't believe the solemn commitment that local government will not really be affected by the GST.' We know, and he has admitted, that the GST will be applied to those non-commercial activities.</para><para>Is it any wonder that councils would not even bother raising their concerns with this minister and this government? In the Labor Party, we have been out there talking to many councils in New South Wales. We know that each one of them is grappling with the implementation of the GST and the problems it has raised for them. They are very concerned. Senator Macdonald hides behind the defence, `They haven't rung me up.' First of all, why would they bother? Secondly, Senator Macdonald is disingenuous in the argument that because they have not necessarily rung him with their problems, therefore one can conclude there are no problems.</para><para>What has been the factual position about this issue? The factual position is that it was not until the end of January this year that the draft determination on exempt taxes, fees and charges was made available. So local government in particular were not even made aware of precisely the range of areas where the GST would apply until the end of January this yearâonly a couple of months ago. They have been waiting for months for that information. I understand it had been sitting on the Treasurer's table since about August last year. So when Senator Macdonald told us at estimates, `They never raised any of these issues with me in the last 12 months,' they have not had an opportunity to because they have not been given the information by the government upon which to then examine precisely the impact. Further, presumably they were relying upon the guarantees given by various ministers in the government that they would be only slightly affected, if at all. Since January, and particularly since March when that list was finalised, they have known the full extent of the application of the GST on their services. They do not now have time to worry about ringing up Senator Macdonald because they are working overtime, spending thousands and thousands of dollars of ratepayers' money, trying to come to grips with exactly how this system is going to work. </para><para>Only a couple of weeks ago, after the budget, I was visiting northern New South Wales, talking to local councils up there. Senator Mackay was thereâshe will recall it. They were telling us that they have just had to get on with the job of trying to work out how they are going to continue to fund the services that they have to provide, one, with the implementation of the GST and, two, having regard to the fact that the federal government really have no interest in local government and have said, `With all of your issues now, go and talk to the states.' That is their attitude. It is just like their attitude to regional Australia generally. I think it was Minister Anderson who said the national government really do not even have any constitutional role in regional Australia. In rural Australia, it is local government that often provides basic services which, in other parts of Australia, particularly metropolitan areas, may be provided by other agencies.</para><para>For instance, many councils in rural and regional Australia are responsible for the water supply service. They are responsible for providing the sewerage service. These are services for which, in the big cities, there is often a state department or a statutory authority or even, in some cases, a privatised body; but when you get out to the local councils in rural and regional Australia, they are the last men standing in terms of providing these sorts of services. They are finding it increasingly difficult because this government has not provided any real increase in funding for local government. That was pointed out earlier by Senator Mackay. They are very much like small businessâthe basis of the economy of many of these country townsâand they are trying to understand and grapple with the implementation of this system. They have real problems with it. But this minister and this government are not even interested in finding out about that.</para><para>What is this minister really interested in? He is interested in interfering in local government when it suits him for political purposes. He is the minister for interfering in local government; he is not the minister for representing local government or the minister for solving the problems of local government. As I pointed out earlier, at estimates Senator Macdonald can never answer a question. He wants to sit there and argue but he will never answer a question. Yet when there is a council election on, he can answer a dorothy dixer from his own side, like he did yesterday. He was asked a question yesterday about the South Sydney Council. He tried to take the opportunity to attack the South Sydney Council. Why would he do that? Why would he pick on the South Sydney Council? He was not going to pick on the Burdekin council, was he? There might be a bit of local embarrassment.</para><para>He picked on the South Sydney Council because he knows that there is going to be an election soon. I think he probably knows what the result is going to be. His attacks in this chamber on the South Sydney Council are not going to make any difference to the result, because just as he did when he tried to attack the Brisbane City Council, again through dorothy dix questions in this chamber, he will again end up with egg all over his face. Just as the Labor Party won a resounding, overwhelming, historic victory in the Brisbane City Council, I am certain that Vic Smith and his team, who have been serving the community of South Sydney so well for so long, will again triumph at the council elections.</para><para>Let Senator Macdonald come in here and answer his dorothy dix questions, have a bit of fun and try to make a few political attacks upon the Labor councils and upon local governmentâbut it is sad. As you travel around rural and regional Australia, as I do whenever I get the opportunity, when we can get away from these hallowed halls here in this building, you really get to talk to people who are out there, in local government particularly, endeavouring to provide the services that their citizens need and to plug the gaps that have been created by this government federally and, at times, by state government. </para><para>When the federal government pulls the funding out, when it says it is not even interested in finding out their concerns, what do local councils do? They cannot just walk away from the problems like Senator Macdonald tries to do; they have to confront those ratepayers, those citizens, every day. They know that they just cannot put up the rates willy-nilly, because in many of these areas the rate income base is very low. They are going to be hit hard in a whole range of service areas, but they are going to continue to struggle to provide those services because people living in those areas are entitled to them. Whilst we are supporting this legislation because of its technical nature, we want to put firmly on the record that this is a minister and a government that have lost interest in local government. If you do not believe that, all you have to do next week when parliament is not sitting is get out there and talk to them. But I think it is going to be too late.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>14794</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAny council that goes around saying, as Senator Forshaw has just led us to believe, that it is going to be hit hard by this GST is utterly misleading its ratepayers and ought to front before the ACCC with a few of the others, like Woolworths, who have attempted to mislead. Of all the sectors of society, local government will benefit the most from the introduction of this tax package as a whole. Senator Gibbs spent 19 minutes of her speech, which was patronisingly praised by Senator Forshaw when he knows the truth of the matter, running down this government's tax package and its effect on local government. It was all wrong, of course. Then she spent the last minute, for those who were listening on broadcast, saying, `But we don't oppose this bill.' What empty rhetoric. If you do oppose it, what are you going to put up in its place? The benefits of this bill are actually supported by the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, a Labor Party Treasurer no less. He issued a statement totally undercutting everything you have said, Senator Forshaw, as you scuttle out of this chamber. The Treasurer of the New South Wales government, a well known Labor government, said himself that local government stands to benefit greatly from the introduction of the goods and services tax.</para></talk.start><para>It is pretty simple arithmetic: $25 billion or thereabouts will be collected in respect of the GST and that full amount goes back to the states. It is more than they are receiving at the moment and it is attached to growthâto retail spending, predominantly. The states will have more to distribute amongst local government. Local government know that. The Treasurer of New South Wales, Mr Egan, knows that. Those on the other side are about the only ones who do not know that. I would say Senator Forshaw knows that, because his whole speech at least admits to being a political speech, whereas Senator Gibbs has been totally and intellectually misled. Senator Forshaw has not been misled because he is an old political player from way back. He mentions the South Sydney Council. He said it was an attack by Ian Macdonald because there is a forthcoming election. That may well be true, because we wish to alert the ratepayers of the deceit of the South Sydney Council. You never mentioned what that deceit was, nor did you deny what that deceit was. They issued a statement to their ratepayers that they will be worse off with the GSTâthat the rates will be GSTed.

That would have to be the most banal committee any senator could have the misfortune to be on. When Senators Mackay, Forshaw and O'Brien enter the room, it goes for a day longer than any other estimates committee. There is not one strike. Name one strike. At least Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner get the odd strikeâthe curtains in the Prime Minister's office or some little run in the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline>, which always loves to run those little banal issues. But let me tell you, Senator Mackay, you have not had a strike. Nor has Senator O'Brien. Nor has Senator Forshaw. Your questions go nowhere but they go for a very, very long time. Is it any wonder Senator Macdonald's patience is tested like a saint's? The man in fact does reply, but how many timesâI am sorry I do not have the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> hereâdoes a man have to reply to the same question? You know that. When he put the question to you, `Well, what's your policy?' you said, `We're not announcing any policies until we are in government,' which is in direct contradiction to Senator Sherry. At least he gave us some hope there would be policy. Some 18 months ago he told us, `There'll be policy at the Hobart conference coming up in a couple of weeks.' I thought, `Well, I'll sit and wait for the Hobart conference.' That has just been put aside now, because Senator Mackay tells us on the record, `No policies until we are elected.' Senator Mackay, you will never get elected under that, but it is pretty dumb logic, nevertheless.

Back to the issue. Local government will benefit from the tax reform through removal of the embedded wholesale sales tax. We are going to keep drumming that in. I know you have heard it a thousand times through this debate, which is coming to its end now. It is becoming contradictory for you. It is becoming highly political. It is becoming absurd for you. We only have another two weeks of parliament for this debate and then we will see. After 1 July, let us see. You are banking so much on this because there is nothing for you on the other side of 1 July. In regard to local government, the wholesale sales tax will be abolished. There is no greater payer of wholesale sales tax than local government itself. On all its transport costs there will be huge savings. General rates, such as water, drainage, sewerage and compulsory rubbish will be exempt. I should pick Senator Gibbs up on that. She said rubbish would be GSTed. Rubbish is not GSTed; it is GST exempt. Fines and penalties and so on will be GST free. All in all, in conclusion I would have to say that local government is a great beneficiary of the whole tax package, as are their ratepayers. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14796</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn this debate on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000 I would like to make a few comments on how this bill, and the way it facilitates the introduction of the GST, will impact on areas that I am associated with in Sydney. The Labor Party of New South Wales has a very fine record of having members in this federal parliament who have had extensive experience in local government. Mrs Crosio, the member for Prospect, was the Mayor of Fairfield. The Chief Whip, Leo McLeay, was on Marrickville Council. Bob Horne was on a council up on the north coast; I cannot recall the name of it. Roger Price was the Deputy Mayor of Blacktown. John Murphy was, I think, the Mayor of Drummoyne. A number of other members in the federal parliament have had a distinguished career in local government. </para></talk.start><para>People who have had that experienceâI note there would be very few people in the government who would have experience in local governmentâcan tell you exactly and directly the impact the GST will have on local government services and facilities. I have never had any experience in local government, but I have been involved in many local government campaigns in my life and I make sure that we get them up. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âI have. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>âFor the benefit of Senator McGauran, we have a term in Sydney called `Pitt Street farmers'. I am told that in Victoria you call them `Collins Street farmers'. I talk from experience, having been involved in regional and rural councils in New South Wales. I have been advised by my colleagues of the detrimental effect the introduction of this GST will have on council services and facilities. In the 1997-98 budget the Howard government cut assistance to local government by $15 million, which has not been reinstated. We were told before the 1998 election that nobody would be worse off under the GST. As I will demonstrate in a moment, that is clearly untrue. </para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the areas I look after as a duty senator, Parramattaâa council that has a Labor lord mayor but is not controlled by the Labor Partyâhave advised me of what they see as the start-up costs of the implementation of the GST. Among the expenses they will have to find as a result of the GST coming in after 1 July will be the following. They believe that the use of their swimming pools will cost an additional $35,640 to their ratepayers. The hiring of sporting fields will cost $10,908. Library fees and services will cost $5,172. Parking fees will increase by $315,000 and golf course fees by $74,000. The hire of council halls will incur an additional cost to the ratepayers of $16,061. </para><para>These higher costs will affect school holiday programs, senior leisure centre learning, site inspection and testing fees and senior leisure learning activities. But that is not the end of it for a council the size of Parramatta. What they will have to do in additionâwhich they are already budgeting forâis to work out the derived costs of the GST. They are budgeting for expenses of over $160,000 this financial year to cover the imple-men-tation of the GST. This money will go to the pur-chase of new software for their ac-counting systems, computer upgrades, and labour associated costs for training and re-tention of an additional accountant to co-ordinate the council's quarterly tax returns. </para><para>This council will have to find another half a million dollars to continue the services they are currently providing to their ratepayers. Yet the government have only budgeted for $2.5 million to assist councils throughout Australia with the implementation of the GST. Parramatta Council, which is not a large council in terms of the size of Sydney, will have to find an additional half a million dollars. The Howard government went to the last election and said `No-one will be worse off.' That is clearly untrue. I would like to say more at the end of my comments about the truth that we should be trying to articulate as politicians.  </para><para>I turn to another area I am involved with. I am a ratepayer of Penrith. Once again, we have an independent mayor there and a Labor minority. So these councils are not Labor controlled. I have been advised that for the hiring of sporting fields, say, the netball courts in PenrithâI think there are 28 or 30 or maybe even more netball courtsâthey are going to have to find an additional $14 per court per season, that is, little girls who run around on the netball courts all day Saturday are going to be slugged with an additional cost. If you hire a sporting field to play rugby league or rugby union or soccer, costs in the same category will increase by between $28 and $68 for each sporting club. You may notice, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I did not mention AFL because it is not all that popular up in Sydney, but it may be down in Tasmania. </para><para>The cost of hiring council halls in places like Cambridge Park, Andromeda Drive, Kingswood Park and Autumn Leaf Neighbourhood Centre, which may be used for twenty-firsts, weddings and sporting club presentations, will go up anywhere between $10 and $20. A yearly pass for a family into Penrith pool will cost an additional $64. The cost for that family will go up to $484. The Gold Squad Swimming Coaching Team there will have to pay an additional $13.50 per month per child. That adds up to $162 per annum. These are our future Olympians. They are going to get slugged by this mean government. </para><para>The council estimates that they will have to spend over $20,000 initially to upgrade and comply with the costs of collecting this tax. But it is not only there that the people of Penrith are being taken for granted. Miss Kelly, the member for Lindsay, seems to have some sort of direct pipeline to the Prime Minister. She might have a pipeline to the Prime Minister in publicity but we cannot get anything out of the Howard government for the residents of Penrith. The people of Penrith have been asking for funding for the preservation of parts of the ADI site at St Marysârefused. They have been asking for assistance in the flood mitigation works along the Hawkesbury Riverârefused. They have been asking for funds for the hydrotherapy pool at St Marysârefused. They have sought funding for several Federation Fund projects, and they have similarly been refused.</para><para>But I suppose one of the worst aspects of what the government has done that has been identified out there is a problem of community safety in the ramps off the M4 onto The Northern Road. The residents of Penrith went to the Commonwealth and asked for assistance in the black spot funding and, once again, it was refused. One lucky thing that came out of Western Sydney is the fact that we have a sympathetic and caring state Labor government and, because of community safety, that money was found and the problem has been fixed up. They are some of the difficulties that local governments will experience come 1 July. It is simply untrue that people will not be worse off. They simply will be worse off. Already councils are rightly preparing themselves for the backlash that will occur.</para><para>I said earlier that I wanted to speak briefly about people making promises that they cannot keep. I think it is really a difficulty for politicians, whatever side we are on, that, if we keep making these sorts of undertakings, then we should keep them because people despair of public affairs at the moment. I do not think we do ourselves any good by making outlandish promises that we never have any intention of keeping. If the government had made promises and they are going to keep them and look after their constituencyâall well and fine. That is the nature of things. But when the they go to an election, when they mislead people, when they try to pull the wool over their eyes, people are rightly angry and frustrated when they do not deliver. If we look at it in terms of the politics of the day, you will note that both parties can get only between 77 per cent and 80 per cent of the primary voteâthat has slipped in the last 20 years. It does not matter whether it is us or those on the government side, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, and you have misled people time and time again. I will tell you one thing, Madam Acting Deputy Presidentâand I suppose senators here are lucky: your colleagues in the House of Representatives are going to get it in the neck next federal election, no matter what you do. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>14798</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI believe that Senator Hutchins during his speech made the assertion that hardly anyone in the government has experienced local government.

I will return to bill that we are considering. The <inline ref="R1005">Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000</inline> makes amendments to the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act with respect to tax reform. Of course, tax reform is a euphemism for the implementation of the goods and services tax. The formula to be applied by the Treasurer each year to determine the increase in the level of local government financial assistance grants is the issue that we are considering. This formula is based on the annual increase in state financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance. Since 1994-95, the state grantsâand hence the grants to local governmentâhave generally increased annually in line with both population and consumer price index movements. Under the 1995 act, local governments should receive around $1.32 billion in financial assistance grants in the year 2000-01. I think it is worth while reminding the chamber that Commonwealth government grants to local government were an initiative of a Labor governmentâthe Whitlam Labor government. Up until that time and since the initiative of the Whitlam government, this government and previous Liberal-National Party governments have generally ignored the financial interests of local government. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill we are considering has two main effects. Firstly, it breaks the link between local government financial assistance grants and state financial grants. The state financial grants will be abolished from 1 July, consistent with the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations.

There will be the continuation of the escalation factor for local government financial assistance on a real per capita basis for previous years. As with the existing provisions, the amendments provide the Treasurer with the discretion to increase or decrease the escalation factor in special circumstances. This bill also amends the act to implement clause 18 of that intergovernmental agreement to require states and the Northern Territory to withhold from any local government authority that does not pay voluntary or notional GST payments a sum representing the amount of unpaid voluntary or notional GST payments. In other words, it puts the onus on state governments. This is an interesting aspect that I will return to later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This legislation is a legacy of the government's attempt to shift all responsibility for local government funding to state and territory governments. In the negotiations that have occurred on GST legislation in this chamber, it was in fact the Labor Party and my colleague from Tasmania, the shadow minister, Senator Mackay, who quite rightly led the debate on this particular issue. Of course, in the later stages of that debate, the Democrats finally accepted the points that our shadow minister and the Labor Party were making with respect to this issue. I would note that, like so many other issues on the GST that the Democrats missed, they had to be alerted by the Labor opposition on this matter. So the Commonwealth will still have a direct financial link to local government. I said earlier that the current Liberal-National government were attempting to shift all responsibility in this area to state governments, in the same way as they have attempted to portray the GST as a state tax when clearly the GST is not a state tax; it is a Commonwealth tax. The GST is legislated for under a Commonwealth head of power. If you go to Budget Paper No. 1 at 4.14 and look at note 4, `Indirect taxation', it lists GST revenue as Commonwealth revenue. No matter what pretence this government attempts to make about it being a state tax, it is clearly not. Interestingly, the GST revenue is listed for the year 2000-01 at $24,053 million, rising to $30,737 million in the year 2003-04. What a massive new tax the GST is with respect to the Australian community.</para><para>I will deal more directly with the so-called assistance that is being given to states. In the case of my own state of Tasmania, there will be a base allocation of $67,000 and a notional council allocation of $58,000âa total of $125,000. I will come back to that matter a little later. One of the central arguments by the government in the lead-up to the election and since is that local government will not be hurt by the GST. But this is not correct. The direct rate charges of local government will not be subject to a GST, but there is a long list of what are classified by this government as commercial services that will be subject to a GST. This is on the basis of the so-called competitive neutrality principle. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, has defended the application of the GST with respect to a wide range of local government services on the basis of competitive neutrality. I will come back to that issue a little later.</para><para>There is an enormous list of areas that local government are involved in where the GST will be applied. The list includes cremation fees, fire maps, sales of bins, sundry rubbish removal, library membership, library fax machine charges, sports grounds and reserve hire fees, catering fees, netball court hire, dog obedience classes, plant and machine hire fees, car parking charges, fire hazard inspection fees, sale of rainwater tanks, swimming pool admission fees, library photocopying charges, senior citizen centre hire fees, recreation centre fees, tennis court hire, basketball court hire, adult day centres and fees for removing rubbish. And that is not an exclusive list.  </para><para>The competitive neutrality argument is that, where a council delivers a service such as those I read outâand there are othersâbecause there is either in reality or potentially a commercial competitor, the GST should apply. This is not an easy principle to apply in practice, particularly in rural and regional Australia, because in many areas of rural and regional Australia the only organisation in a community that will provide many of these services is local government. The fact is that it is simply not commercially viable for a private sector organisation to provide these sorts of services, so why should residentsâparticularly in rural and regional Australiaâbe disadvantaged by the impractical application of the so-called competitive neutrality principle?</para><para>I will turn to a couple of examples of particular problems that have arisen on the north-west coast of Tasmania. These were highlighted in an excellent article by my local paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline>, which did a survey of various problems being encountered by councils on the north-west coast of Tasmania. I acknowledge that this survey was also prompted by our shadow minister and my colleague from Tasmania Senator Mackay. I will go through this survey by the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> briefly. I make the point that the people who were asked in local government were not councillors; they were not politically biased or motivated in any way. With respect to the Circular Head Council, the financial services manager, Mr Brett Russell, said that the council was unable to estimate how much compliance would be, but that costs were certain to outweigh the savings. The article goes on. The Latrobe general manager, Mr Grant Atkins, estimated that $40,000 had been spent in recent months. He did admit that this was only a guess, but he is in a good position to know. The accountant of the Waratah-Wynyard Council, Ms Lisa Dixon, said that GST factors were putting pressure on the council's resources. The general manager of the West Coast Council, Mr Paul West, said that he had not kept count of its total compliance costs, but he believed the figure would be very significant. I referred earlier to the allocation made to councils to cover these costs. With an allocation of approximately $2,000 per council, it is obviously woefully inadequate. I think the most revealing comment was from the Burnie general manager, Mr Paul Arnold, who said that the council would lose half a million dollars in productivity costs due to the implementation of the GST. Local government, in some areas, is going to have to wait until 1 July to know what the true costs of the implementation of the GST will be.</para><para>I will conclude with a few other remarks. I do attend Senate estimates, usually Finance and Public Administration, and Economicsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>âBig deal!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âIt is certainly not a big deal, Senator Vanstone, when you have Senator Kemp before you, let me assure you of that. Senator Kemp is well known for his approach to questions, both in question time and in estimates. Senator Kemp answers by being very evasive or irrelevant. But when you compare his performance, which is very poor, with that of Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Ian Macdonald is the worst performer. At Senate estimates Senator Ian Macdonald does not even attempt to answer any questions. He tries to shut down the estimates by not addressing any issues at all, particularly on the GST, but when Senator Ian Macdonald comes into question time, he can answer questions posed by his sideâdorothy dixersâparticularly in relation to local government elections. He has done that on a number of occasions. He answered a dorothy dixer in respect of the Brisbane City Council elections. He was attempting to support the Liberal team that was running in those elections. In doing so, he thought he would increase the profile of the Liberal Party team and increase their vote. Of course, we all know the result. The Labor Party won with a crushing majority. One other aspect of those local council elections, of course, is that the Liberal Party attempted to run a fundraiser for the Liberal candidate. They had to cancel the fundraiser. Guess who was the guest speaker scheduled to attract the Liberal Party faithful to the luncheon? It was none other than Senator Ian Macdonald. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title><type>Matters of Public Interest</type><page.no>14802</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Jim (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McKiernan)</inline>âOrder!

It is an unfortunate reality that, amidst this publicity, many of the true issues and facts that should have been addressed in this debate were ignored, derided as being untrue or politically incorrect or described as political propaganda. There is no greater example of inflammatory or misleading statements than those made by the Leader of the Opposition on 4 April 2000 in the parliament. Mr Beazley claimed that a pregnant mother with three young children had been jailed for 14 days as a result of mandatory sentencing. This is totally false and was very obviously part of a campaign by the federal Labor Party to overturn the Territory's mandatory sentencing laws to benefit their Territory colleagues politically. This was a shameful act by Mr Beazley and his party. He should apologise to the federal parliament for the statement and also to the Northern Territory government.</para></talk.start><para>By virtue of all the misinformation being bandied about, it is also an unfortunate reality that some people will still continue to attempt to overturn the legislation of a democratically elected parliament. I am astounded that Senator Brian Greig can say in this chamber:</para><quote><para>There is, I think, a strong feeling in the general community and certainly with the government that the issue of mandatory sentencing is over, that it is finished, it is complete and should no longer be dealt with because it has been finalised.</para></quote><para>He then went on to say that the Democrats do not think it is finalised. So what will they do? They will effectively ignore the wishes of the Northern Territory voters, and the wider community, by attempting to once again ignite this debate and overturn the legislation of a democratically elected parliament. Senator Greig is attempting to do this by tacking on an amendment to the <inline ref="R961">Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline>, which attacks the Territory's mandatory minimum sentencing legislation. It is an arrogant and inappropriate response to a very serious issue. Even Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, thinks that Senator Greig's actions are inappropriate. He said:</para><quote><para>I think we have to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of dealing with the mandatory sentencing issue in portfolio bills such as the one we have before the chamber at the moment.</para></quote><para>I agree with Senator Faulkner, and it is not too often that that happens. Senator Greig should recognise that the debate has been had; it is over. The legislation will remain. It is appropriate, though, that I as the Country Liberal Party senator for the Northern Territory take this opportunity, now that the hype has died down to a quiet roar and sensible debate can finally take place, to put on the public record many of the facts and positives that were totally ignored amid the hysteria and political opportunism over the last few months.</para><para>The media and others totally ignored the most important fact relating to mandatory sentencing: it is legislation that was introduced by a democratically elected government that had put forward mandatory sentencing as one of its main platforms at an election in which it had its most resounding victory ever. The vast majority of people in the Northern Territory agree with mandatory sentencing. They wanted it to be implemented and they want it to remain. Senator Greig must understand that, although he does not like it, Territorians do and that is their right. He must not continue to interfere in the legitimate governance of the Northern Territory.</para><para>The issue of juvenile justice and mandatory sentencing attracted the greatest interest in the debate. It should be noted that mandatory sentencing only applies to juveniles aged 15, 16 and 17. I would first like to outline the options for juveniles that are available through the many diversionary programs that have already been approved by the Northern Territory government. These programs may be used when a juvenile appears before a court for the second time and is found guilty of a property offence. The court may require the juvenile to participate in a diversionary program as an alternative to spending time in a detention centre such as the Don Dale Juvenile Detention Centre, which I believe has been described by Amnesty International as one of the best facilities of its type in the worldâa model facility. </para><para>If the juvenile satisfactorily completes a diversionary program, the court may discharge the juvenile without penalty. There are 21 approved diversionary programs and they include, amongst others: the community services component of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia; a Somerville Functional Family Therapy/Intervention Program; a Tangentyere Council Indigenous Five-a-Side Soccer Program; a Victim/Offender Conferencing Program; and programs at Imanpa, Santa Teresa, Papunya, Yuendemu and Titjikala. Proposed programs by 10 Aboriginal communities throughout the Territory are still being considered.</para><para>There was a quite absurd situation in the Territory during this debate where the government was criticised because some diversionary programs had not had any juveniles go through them. There is a simple answer for this: the number of juveniles in detention or in need of the programs is so low that, inevitably, there will be programs with no participants. At this very moment, there are 13 juveniles in detention, and only one of them is detained for offences under mandatory sentencing. It is important to note that mandatory minimum sentencing laws are only a part of the Northern Territory government's broad range of programs to deal with antisocial behaviour. There are many innovative schemes provided by both government and non-government agencies that offer prevention, intervention and diversionary programs aimed at minimising antisocial behaviour and assisting those with problems. The vast majority of these schemes receive substantial Northern Territory government funding.</para><para>A major cause of social problems in the Northern Territory is alcohol and alcohol related issues. It is an unfortunate fact that this is a very big problem in the Territory, and the government has many schemes aimed at addressing the issues. I would like to point out that, for the past six years, the Northern Territory government has been recognised by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia as the No.1 ranked jurisdiction in Australia in terms of funding for alcohol and other drugs programs. That is but one example of a Territory health program at work.</para><para>Returning to the issue of young people at risk, funding has been provided by way of the wine cask levy to some 17 organisations throughout the Northern Territory which have a particular youth focus. The Anyinginyi Congress is receiving funding to implement a community development program addressing antisocial behaviour in Tennant Creek, with youth as a priority. There are two Palmerston Town Council programs, one of which aims to develop recreational and developmental strategies for young people in Palmerston, particularly drug and alcohol diversions, and another which develops and implements a strategic plan for young people in the Palmerston region. The Katherine Youth Group funds a camp during school holidays for at-risk teenage girls, and the Barunga Manyallaluk will progress a junior warden scheme with youth volunteers.</para><para>In spite of its efforts in implementing many innovative and highly successful schemes, the Northern Territory has been painted by some in the mediaâand, unfortunately, even some here in this chamberâas being uncaring, unresponsive and irresponsible when dealing with many social issues. This is simply not true, and it is unfortunate that I do not have more time to describe the innovative and successful social programs the Territory is undertaking. </para><para>I would like to table a document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Mandatory Minimum Sentencing: what it is all about, the facts and myths</inline>. This document not only debunks many falsehoods relating to mandatory sentencing but also gives a good outline of the many programs relating to social issues. I would draw it to the attention of senators and, very particularly, to the attention of the media. Some of the myths that this document debunks include the following: juveniles are jailed the first time they commit a crime; mandatory minimum sentencing laws target Aborigines; people are being sent to jail for trivial offences; a person will receive the same sentence for a trivial offence as for a more serious one; jail should be the last resort for a juvenile offender; a mother of five received 14 days' jail for stealing a pram for her baby; Aborigines, particularly juveniles, are being jailed in large numbers because of mandatory sentencing; mandatory sentencing is sending women to jail in large numbers; mandatory sentencing is wrong in principle; and innocent people are being jailed because of mandatory minimum sentencing. I believe all senators should peruse this document, because it shows the innovative attempts that are taking place at the community level in the Northern Territory to address these very significant problems. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Jim (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Sen-ator McKiernan)</inline>âIs leave granted for the tabling of the document?

The recent focus on aged care has revealed systemic problems in the gov-ern-ment's aged care system. The minister has attemp-ted to portray the Riverside case as an iso-lated one. She claims to have dealt with the problem by closing the facility. The reality is that Riverside was just one example of where the government's complaints system failed to protect older Australians. The prob-lems are widespread and are impacting on the care of thousands of residents. </para></talk.start><para>The fact that it took a month to respond to serious complaints from nursing home staff about the treatment of residentsâand they had been bathed in kerosene despite some having open wounds and some being terminally illâis just a symptom of the systemic failure of the system. A total review of the complaints system is urgently needed, and major changes must be made if residents are to be properly protected. The minister's response to date has been to make minor changes, more for appearance than any real attempt to address the problems identified in the system. An effective complaints system is vital for ensuring quality of care of aged people living in residential accommodation. </para><para>In a succession of Senate estimates hearings, Labor has pursued the department and the standards agency over the handling of com-plaints. The responses and excuses stand as a damning indictment of the complaints res-olution system. The flaws are at a system level. We have a complaints system which fails to hold anyone responsible for investigating serious complaints about the care of an in-dividual. The system can examine broad-brush issues, facility issues, but it cannot get down to care and treatment issues specific to in-dividuals. It is a system that is reluctant to take action unless continually pushed by the resi-dent or their family. When a problem is iden-tified, the system fails to do the follow-up. The arrangements to monitor standards and to manage known risks are ineffective. They are infrequent and poorly targeted, and inspection visits come with early warnings. It is a system that does not know how to effectively investigate allegations concerning the suitability of aged care providers. Finally, the complaints system does not set out any procedures or protocols to ensure that, if a complaint about an aged care facility is made to a state authority, this complaint is immediately forwarded to the department or the agency. Systems are not in place to guarantee that whenever a complaint is made the Commonwealth authorities know about it. </para><para>The first of these problems is perhaps the most basic. Under the government's system, there is no-one in the department or the standards agency who is responsible for investigating specific complaints about an individual. The department's complaints resolution scheme, where complaints are first lodged, is essentially a mediation service. It has no role in properly investigating specific complaints. Its modus operandi is to relay the complaint to the provider and the provider's response back to the complainant, in an effort to find an agreeable compromise between the parties. That might be appropriate where the complaint is relatively minor, such as an issue about the quality of food. But clearly, where a family has serious concerns about the care being delivered to their relative, this mediation process will not always be appropriate. The complaints about kerosene baths at Riverside were totally inappropriately sent down this process of mediation. The experience of many families which have been in contact with me is that this mediation process can go on for months and even years without any proper resolution of their concerns and without giving them the finality or the peace of mind that they deserve. </para><para>Throughout the process, complainants are con-stantly asked by the department if they are satisfied, and they have to continually in-i-tiate more action. Inevitably, many just give up and walk away with their concerns unresolved. The reality is that the system seems to be designed to wear down complainants rather than to address their concerns. Where the complaints relate to serious concerns about care, the process is patently inappropriate. In one case that Senator Schacht and I have been involved with, where a man was placed in Alchera Park Nursing Home in Queensland, the man's family lodged such a serious complaint in September last year. The department began the process of mediation. Weeks later, the resident was admitted to the nearby public hospital, suffering from dehydration and gangrenous wounds, in a condition that physically distressed experienced nurses at the hospital. He died within days of admission. </para><para>Unaware of the man's death, the department contacted his daughter, having got the provider's comments on the complaint, with a view to finding an agreeable compromise. The department did not even know that the man had died in the meantime. During that process the department forwarded the complaint to the standards agency. Here we enter the world of Joseph Heller, as the department does not investigate complaints but can refer them to the agency which has such inspection powers. However, this is where catch-22 comes in. The agency does not investigate specific complaints but will carry out only a general review of the care standards and the facility at the time. The agency will not deal with individual complaints or complainants. By the time the agency visited Alchera Park on 30 November last year, after providing a week's notice of the visit, the complainant's father had passed away six weeks earlier.</para><para>This is a complaint about the standard of care he received prior to his death. The agency did not and does not attempt to find out what specifically happened in relation to the care of the deceased resident just prior to his death. The very real and serious concerns of the daughter over just how her father's condition deteriorated to such an extent remain unanswered. Not surprisingly, the daughter remains completely unsatisfied with the whole process, as do the families of at least three other residents who have died at Alchera Park under similar circumstances.</para><para>But under the government's complaints system, these very serious complaints effectively fall between the cracks. A complaints system which does not deal with the deaths of residents is fundamentally flawed. The case of Alchera also highlights concerns over the effectiveness of the monitoring of nursing homes that are known to have problems with residents' care. The agency admitted that risks to residents were identified in the nursing home early in 1999. The provider convinced the agency that these were being resolved, yet when the agency went back in November it found many of the same problems still occurring. This mirrors exactly the situation in Riverside, where it was given the all clear in November 1999 but fundamentally failed to meet care standards only months later. It so fundamentally failed that the minister said the home had to be closed, but they gave it a tick only months earlier.</para><para>These cases raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of the monitoring of nursing homes where problems are identified. Where complainants do raise concerns and these are vindicated by the standards agency, the system provides no assurance that these problems will be addressed. Many in the sector have concerns that the agency provides notice of any visit, and there is evidence of providers being allowed to cover up evidence of problems or put in temporary fixes. It has also emerged that within the system there are Chinese walls existing between the department, the agency and state investigative bodies. The Riverside case highlighted the lack of communication between the department and the agency. A serious complaint was not referred by the department to the agency, which has powers of inspection. The department and the agency also do not communicate with relevant state organisations, which means that people can lodge complaints with the state health rights body and the Commonwealth remains blissfully unaware of the concerns. The agency does not bother to check with these other regulatory bodies when accrediting a facility. </para><para>Given the Commonwealth's responsibility for ensuring standards of care, basic protocols for communications with state bodies should and must be established. Breakdowns in communication and delays in action are also evident in the department's failure to investigate allegations over the suitability of a provider in Victoria. It was alleged that the provider had a conviction for stalking an employee, an indictable offence that is grounds for having his licence revoked. The department received the allegation in May 1998, yet it took them 18 months to write to the provider in December 1999 asking if the allegations were true. That was the level of response to the complaintâ18 months late and then write him a letter saying, `Are these allegations about you true?' Funnily enough, he replied that they were not.</para><para>As of May this year, the department has been unable to ascertain the truth of the allegations despite a number of media reports of what seems like an admission by the provider that the allegations are based on fact. This is a nursing home provider who owns at least two homes which have been the subject of numerous poor reports, identifying low levels of care, inadequate care and poor management. The provider is currently under sanctions in both homes. I note that the sanctions have been imposed quite recently. The system is clearly failing when a serious allegation is made against the suitability of a provider who is charged with caring for the frail elderly and two years later the department has not investigated the claim or brought the claim to any conclusion.</para><para>There are major systemic problems in the complaints system in aged care in this country. The failures are not isolated cases. They are not issues purely to do with the training of staff, et cetera. The minister's response has been totally inadequate. There is now a real crisis of confidence in the aged care complaints system in this country. Families who have been devastated by the loss of a loved one get no satisfaction from pursuing legitimate concerns through the system. The system has failed those families, has failed the residents and continues to fail in providing an effective complaints mechanism. Something must be done. The system must be revised. We need better checks and balances. We need better investigative powers. We need better coordination.</para><para>It is not acceptable to say that the examples I have used are somehow just isolated examples of individual error. There are systemic problems in the system. It is failing to protect older Australians. The fact that the complaints system can get a complaint about dying residents being bathed in kerosene baths and for a month not treat that complaint seriously but seek to mediate it shows there is something wrong. The fact that you can have four deaths in one nursing home where each of the deaths is accompanied by allegations of a lack of proper care and still there has not been a proper investigation into those deaths conducted several years later is an indictment again of the failure of the system.</para><para>We have a system where a convicted stalker continues to be allowed to run two nursing homes, despite the fact that they have consistently been found to provide poor quality care, they have been the subject of numerous bad reports as to the standard of care provided and it has been on the public record that this provider has been convicted of an indictable offence. Yet the department sat on the complaint for 18 months, and a further six months laterânow two years since the complaint was madeâno effective action has been taken and they cannot even ascertain whether or not he has been convicted of an indictable offence, which would result in the loss of his licence. They are just three examples of a system that is failing older Australians. </para><para>We cannot get a more serious allegation than the one in relation to Alchera Park. That lack of care contributed to the early death of a resident of that home and still there has not been a proper investigation of the incident. Still there has not been a proper investigation as to whether proper care was given. The only body that has expressed any interest, apart from the opposition, in pursuing this matter, has been the Department of Veterans' Affairs. When it heard of the concerns about the treatment of a couple of veterans at Alchera Park, it wrote to the Department of Health and Aged Care expressing its concern about what it understood to be the treatment of those diggers, one of whose relatives described the treatment he received there as being worse than he got at Changi.</para><para>These are very serious concerns but they are symptomatic of a system that has failed to deliver, a system that is fundamentally flawed and a system that is not meeting the needs of older Australians and their families. Unless we fix it and unless the minister makes fundamental reform, the problems will continue and people will continue to suffer because complaints are not dealt with adequately, complaints are not investigated properly and issues are not resolved to the satisfaction of the parties concerned. We need fundamental change. I offer the Labor opposition's cooperation in drawing up a much more effective complaints mechanism that better serves the needs of older Australians living in residential care.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Schools Funding</title><page.no>14807</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14807</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak about the May budget and the educational problems that it failed to address. This budget has entrenched Dr Kemp's strategy of throwing a substantial amount of new money to non-government schools while government schools got only the scraps. Even Dr Kemp has admitted that funding to non-government schools will increase by 40 per cent over the next four years and by only 21 per cent for government schools. We all know that that 21 per cent, when it is spread over four years, is only five per cent a year and, therefore, not much more than indexation, if anything at all. He says this will address inequities in non---govern-ment school funding using the new SES fund-ing formula for non-government schools. </para></talk.start><para>The question really, though, is whether the SES means windfalls to the wealthier schools that do not need it. Already I have been contacted by some disadvantaged independent schools who are angry because they expect to receive no more money than wealthy schools nearby, even though they have far less in the way of resources to offer students. This would suggest that the proposed model is not needs based, as we have been led to believe by the minister. But we still do not have the legislation on which to judge this, even though it was about 18 months ago that it was first announced this was the way the government would proceed and 12 months ago, May 1999, when we all received very glossy brochures telling us how it would work. This kind of delay not only exacerbates funding uncertainty for non-government schools but also delays an important public debate over the future of Australian schooling.</para><para>A bit over $6,000 a year all up is spent on students in government secondary schools. Twice that amount is spent on students in many even moderately well off private schools. I ask the Senate to consider today what sort of public policy provides for 65 per cent of secondary students remaining in public education with far less resources than those available to most of the other 35 per cent.</para><para>Two weeks ago there was, quite rightly, another public outcry about the enrolment benchmark adjustment. The 1999 enrolment figures came out and $27 million will be wiped from public education budgets nationally. Yet already amounts are being deducted from the Commonwealth financial assistance grants to the states in recognition of any changes in government school enrolments. So Dr Kemp's arguments that the enrolment benchmark adjustment eases the taxpayers' burden is a complete fallacy. In fact, for the $27 million deduction, government school enrolments increased by 8,300 across the board. It was only a minor deduction in enrolments in New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, but in Victoria and Queensland the new enrolments in government schools were very substantial. </para><para>But back to the budget. Spending on targeted programs will increase by 9.4 per cent for government schools and 13 per cent for non-government schools over four years. The Advanced English for Migrants Program loses $20 million and gets absorbed into general literacy spending; and that, of course, continues Dr Kemp's practice of subsuming many programs tackling English as a second language and disadvantage into the catch-all of literacy funding. It is easy to then point to a literacy crisis and pretend that you are actually doing a lot about it.</para><para>Educational disadvantage is not solely a function of poor literacy but has many causes, particularly socioeconomic. Family dysfunction, alienation, poverty and fragmented communities all have a role. In rural and remote areas many children, particularly indigenous children, go to school with nothing in their bellies. It is hard to learn on an empty stomach, yet Dr Kemp is trying to make us believe that extra literacy and numeracy classes will fix everything. Well, of course, they will not. It is much easier too if you can blame teachers for poor literacy and numeracy rates and then attribute school leaving to poor literacy and numeracy. It ultimately blames teachers for failing to fix society's ills.</para><para>The people who are supposed to be fixing all of these problems, our teachers, are receiving a very raw deal indeed from the government. There was no extra money in the budget towards tackling the teacher shortage, which officially does not exist according to the minister. Our teachers are going overseas, thanks to the marketing savvy of the 12 British agencies now recruiting in Australia, and they are teachers that we in this country cannot afford to lose. The Australian Council of Deans of Education estimates that we will experience shortages of graduate teachers of up 40 per cent at primary level and up to 50 per cent at secondary level. The question is: just exactly from where are we going to recruit our new teachers?  New Zealand?  The example there is that New Zealand teachers also are going overseas.</para><para>To its credit, the government has introduced the quality teacher program, a professional development program that, by all accounts, is fulfilling many objectives. But it is not designed to alleviate teacher shortage and, I must say, it is a shadow of its former self. Federal funding is now $77 million over four years compared with $44 million every year for professional development between 1993 and 1996. As of December, teachers also can expect far less assistance to help their most difficult students. The full service schools program will be gone by the end of this year. I have heard nothing but praise for this programârun on a shoestring, $24 million over the entire country over three years. It worked on a regional basis in which schools in some of our most disadvantaged areas were working together to help children at risk of leaving school and those returning to school through changes to the common youth allowance. The Senate will remember that three years ago under-18-year-olds had their unemployment benefits removed and needed to be in full-time education to receive income support. That problem is still with usâthe problem of young people in years 11 and 12 being somehow alienated from their schools and not wishing to return, preferring instead to be looking for work.  </para><para>The schools used the money to employ literacy and numeracy specialists. They used the money for counsellors, they provided vocational education, they did outdoor education, they liaised with community agencies and generally they sought to re-engage students in education. Frankston in Victoria, in Melbourne's south, has the lowest retention rate for young males and females in Victoria, outstripping even rural areas in Gippsland. Forty-five per cent of Frankston males leave school before completing year 12, as do 27 per cent of females. Now a much-needed program to assist those students has gone. It is a pity that these young people live where they do and not a little further down the train line in Dr Kemp's electorate of Goldstein. </para><para>This program has been cut despite the fact that departmental evaluation of it is not due until December this year. In spite of that, Dr Kemp has decided to axe the program and there is nothing, as far as I can see, in the budget to take its place. We do not know whether state governments will continue to provide any funding. Their funding was matched by Commonwealth contributions. It is difficult to get accurate figures, but in Victoria more than half of the students who leave after year 11 do not go on to full-time work, training or further education. They end up unemployed without an income or in precarious part-time or casual work. For those who leave after year 10 the situation is even more bleak, with 60 per cent not accessing full-time work or education. Far fewer young people than anticipated actually returned to school following the youth allowance changes. The question we need to ask is: where exactly are they? We simply do not know the answer to that question. Many have slipped through the cracks of society. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Monday this week gives us some insight into what is going on in some of those disadvantaged schools. An article by Mr Chris Wheat, who is a teacher at the Sunshine Secondary College, reads: </para><quote><para>I must speak out. A great many government secondary schools are awash with illiterate students; many classrooms hold gaggles of them, products of institutionalised neglect. </para><para>Most independent schools, and those government schools with elite selection policies, are free of the problem, and that helps them to flourish. </para><para>But other than to engage experts to devise programs for interested schools, for the past three decades there has never been a concerted effort by government to deal with illiterate students at the secondary level. Schools have always been expected to find the staff and money to deal with their own problems, and schools with the greatest number of illiterate studentsâschools that are likely to have the most dubious public standingâhave much to gain by playing down the problem.</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Because schools are humane places and all teachers are intensely aware of the problemâit impinges on their teaching every time they face a classâmost schools try to do something about literacy. But far too many put up ersatz programs run by staff with a few periods to spare, using leftover rooms, and operating on minimal budgetsâand having a lifespan of one school year. On-the-cheap programs soon become, not essential parts of the curriculum, but acts of charity. </para><para>And so it goes: thousands of illiterate adolescents will leave government schools by the end of this year. Every teacher knows this.</para></quote><para>I commend this article to honourable senators for a complete read because I think it tells us a bit more about what is going on in our government schools than we would otherwise want to admit.</para><para>I hear nothing from Dr Kemp's office about help for students at risk that acknowledges that they need more than just literacy assistance. The 1996 House of Representatives inquiry into truancy and school exclusion mentioned a raft of programs that no longer exist. There used to be a transient and mobile students program that monitored student movements between schools. There was also a children in residential care project. We do not have a national overview of truancy. Records are haphazard. Yet the Australian Council of State School Organisations estimates that many children do not even make it to primary school, let alone navigate the problematic transition from primary to secondary school.</para><para>In rural and remote areas, these problems are usually worse. The country area program did not receive any additional funding in the budget. This program costs about $20 million annually and in 1996 reached about 1,300 schools Australia-wide. About 90 per cent of these are government schools. We are gaining a lot of valuable information as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into remote education unfolds. Rural and regional kids have far less access to technology and to teachers qualified in the subject areas that they teach. Primary education, let alone preschool or equivalent, is not universally accessible, but the federal government is still sitting on its hands. It is giving money to people who leave their communities and nothing to balance the exodus.</para><para>The Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme receives an additional $16 million over four years. This is indeed warranted, but again we see Dr Kemp's divide and rule strategy of favouring programs that predominantly benefit the private sector and give nothing to the public sector. Many families simply cannot afford boarding school for their children and some indigenous students suffer enormous culture shock when sent away to board. We need to focus on offering quality government education in rural and remote areas. We do not need more spending on parent surveys, league tables and benchmarks. Comedian Max Gillies, a public school graduate, said in today's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>: </para><quote><para>It seems to me that the ideological pendulum has swung back recently towards the exam as the most effective measure of learning and intellectual development. While this may be true for specific areas of knowledge, in most cases what it measures is the ability to pass exams ...</para><para>Without the commitment of a number of teachers whose educational values extended beyond a set of measurable outcomes, I may have left school without a sense of infinite possibility for the future.</para></quote><para>I am sure if Mr Max Gillies were a child today, he would not have been inspired by the dogged, exclusive emphasis of this government on benchmarking and the three Rs.

It is part of a series of speeches I intend making on online gambling because, with this new development, we are now facing in Australia a continuation of the major social and financial problems of the thousands of Australians that have been created by the explosion in gambling over the last five years. With Internet gambling, the possibility of that explosion developing even further now faces this country. For example, technology is coming within the next year that will mean that with just a click of a mouse thousands of dollars could be lostâthat is, if governments do not move to regulate this environment more thoroughly. This new technology has the potential to turn every home in Australia into a casino. </para></talk.start><para>What I want to touch on in today's speech are the latest developments in the online gambling industry, including its growth, the impact of the gambling industry so far in Australia, the impact of online gambling in the United States and the potential impact on young people. First I want to touch on some of the new developments since I last spoke on this matter in the chamber. States and territories around Australia are currently granting online gambling licences, despite a call by Minister Jocelyn Newman for a moratorium on the issue of such licences. That call was made by the minister in April as the Chair of the Ministerial Council on Gambling, which all states and territories attended. Despite this call for a national approach, in the last few months the Tasmanian Gaming Commission approved five new licences for online casino and sports bets and the ACT recently issued two new online gambling licences. </para><para>The federal government is not happy with these current developments in Internet gambling. We are looking to impose at least a 12-month moratorium on those processes, possibly effective from 19 May 2000. But the alarming point has already been reached, before the reviews can be carried out and before proper controls can be put in place, where states are going ahead off their own bats. This is unprecedented if we have a look at the introduction of new products and new technologies into Australia. What normally happensâif I can use the example of bringing new drugs into the country for medical purposesâis that they are all tested very carefully first; the impact of them is very carefully assessed. What the states are proposing to do at the moment by going ahead off their own bats is to bring into Australia a technology that could potentially have devastating effects on the families and communities in this country. Social impact studies have not been conducted. As a result, we could have a continuation of what the Productivity Commission saw as the development of a major social problem with gambling in Australia.</para><para>Regulation of gambling is currently done on a state by state basis, but this new technology with the Internet knows no borders. The online gambling developments that are likely to come will threaten the welfare systems of each of our states. We are now calling on the states to look at this whole matter from a national perspective and to not take a competitive approach with each other. Reverend Tim Costello appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies during its Netbets inquiry in Melbourne and stated that, if a competitive approach is taken between the states, it will be a race for the bottom in terms of standards. The Northern Territory actually set this up before this regulatory approach was suggested nationwide. It has taken a responsible approach and set up a proper regulatory regime. We now call on all states and territories to fall in line with a very similar approach to make sure that we come up with a national approach. We have some evidence internationally on what is likely to happen if such an international approach is not taken. The effects on the economy with the expansion of this new technology can be quite devastating to society.  </para><para>Frank Feather, the author of FutureConsumer.com, recently spoke at the Global Interactive Gaming Summit and Expo in Canada. He estimated that the online gambling industry will be worth over $90 billion worldwide by the end of the decade. Australian gambling operators have already shown the start of the effects of this sort of explosion happening in Australia. Lassiters in the Northern Territory is our only legalised online site at this time. Between April and November 1999 they attracted over 16,000 players with a turnover of $18 million. The company now predicts that turnover will grow from this point by 75 per cent a month. The 1998-99 turnover of Canbet Pty Ltd in the ACT was $47 million and the company expects to almost double that this year.</para><para>A review of online gambling by the Senate Information Technology Committee in the Netbets inquiry found that there are 14 corporations now involved in online gambling in Australia. These corporations say most of their clients are from overseas. These Australian corporations are competing with overseas providers. Australia is actually seen as a world leader in the regulating of gambling but there are many concerns about overseas operators. When you understand the way in which they set up and get their licences, you can see what the concern is.</para><para>There are some very shonky operators in the international field operating out of the Caribbean and Asia. Some countries such as Antigua are charging $100,000 for an online gambling licence and they do not have a strict regulatory system. I heard one story of an operator who wanted to set up an international gambling site. He went down to the local police chief, paid him $100,000, got his licence and then off he wentâno questions asked. Nothing about regulation or standards was said.</para><para>Some of these companies try to lure Australian players by actually putting Australian flags, koala bears or kangaroos on the front of their site. People then think they are gambling on an Australian site which has a good reputation in terms of regulation. This is a real trap for consumers. Australians can currently access these sites around the world. Some obviously are more regulated than others, as I have indicated.</para><para>The basic question we have to ask ourselves is: does Australia really need more access to gambling sites? We already have 20 per cent of the world's poker machines. New South Wales alone has 10 per cent of the world's poker machines. New South Wales has one-thousandth of the world's population but it has one-tenth of the world's poker machines. That shows how out of kilter we are in this field.</para><para>Online gambling licences are now being granted despite evidence that problem gambling with the current forms of gambling could now directly affect 200,000 people in Australia. That is 200,000 people with a gambling problem. That is the equivalent of the size of Canberra. If we put the knock-on effect of that to their families, their work and the other people that they relate toâand that is estimated conservatively to be between another five and seven peopleâwe are up to over one million people, the equivalent of a city the size of Adelaide.</para><para>All this problem gambling has come into effect without the Internet taking off at this point. That is why we have concerns about the development of this new technology. Even with the current technology, Australia now faces major social and personal problems because of the rapid expansion in gambling over the last five years. Since 1995, gambling expenditure has gone from $7.5 billion to $11 billion. That is a 50 per cent increase in four years. The number of bankruptcies in this time has almost doubled. This is fed, in the main, by poker machine growth. We now have 190,000 poker machines in Australia. In the town of Cootamundra there is one poker machine for every 40 people. One would have thought that this is just a little over the top. It is over the top when you particularly consider the costs to the community. </para><para>The Productivity Commission has estimated the gambling cost to the community could be as high as $5 billion a year. This includes legal costs, lost productivity, counselling services, bankruptcy and crime. So the question is: why do we actually need more gambling outlets? Australians can already bet in a massive rangeâpubs, clubs, Lotto, TAB, casinos such as Star City, Crown and Lassiters, for some Australians, and there are many other examples. Do we need access to more gambling outlets?</para><para>The United States is finding very similar problems to Australia in this regard. The track that they are moving down at the moment is towards banning online gambling. The Kyl bill, put forward by Senator Kyl from Arizona, has passed through the Senate and is now before the US Congress. It is heading towards a total ban on Internet gambling. They are taking that approach based on a number of studies on the effects of gambling in the United States. They have found, for example, in studies from the University of Illinois, that up to 90 per cent of pathological gamblers commit crimes to pay off their wagering debt. For every dollar that goes to the state from gambling, they pay out $3 in social and criminal costs.</para><para>Concerns about gambling problems were highlighted during hearings on the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act in the US. Jeffrey Pach, the executive vice-president of the National Football League, told the inquiry that gambling and sports should not mix. Sports betting is a growing concern in high schools, with high school and college students developing serious addictions as a result of being introduced to sports betting that is often considered harmless. Other witnesses at the hearingâfor example, the Ohio Attorney-General Betty Montgomeryâtold the inquiry that people can gamble away their life savings at the click of a mouse. She was struck by the way that gambling web sites look like video games.</para><para>It takes no time at all for someone to find the site, set up an account and wager a lot of money. A child could do it. No photo ID is required. How can they tell these people are under age? The Attorney-General in the US has highlighted problems in regulation. Traditional forms of gambling systems that check people's background, verify the game's integrity, resolve consumer disputes and verify the age of players do not exist in terms of Internet gambling. Unfortunately, thousands of Australians are gambling on overseas sites that have not met proper consumer protection criteria. The same Attorney-General says that what makes the Internet so attractive is its anonymityâchildren can easily pose as adults and adults can easily pose as other people. There are tremendous consumer protection risks in the development of this industry. </para><para>The Australian Bureau of Statistics has identified people aged 25 and below as some of the main users of the Internet. We found in our Netbets report that the appeal of the Internet to young people threatens to develop into a new generation of problem gamblers. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper reported on 18 April on the incidence of problem gambling among Asian university students. People will recall the article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> about Burswood Casino, which has become very popular, with some overseas students reportedly losing between $500 and $4,000 a night.</para><para>The president of the Indonesian Students Society commented that casinos are becoming a playground for these students from wealthy families. This is attributed mainly to problems of boredom. This is just one example of the problems developing with problem gamblers. Online gambling could end up like the cocaine of gambling. The consequences to families from this could be quite disastrous. All governments in Australia must act in a united way to reduce the risks to young people and to people with gambling addictions. The identification of harm minimisation policies by the Senate committee must be applied nationwide to prevent this developing social problem. </para><para>Goods and Services Tax: Advertisements</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>14813</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak today on a matter of considerable public interest, and that is the issue of GST advertising. This government's GST advertising campaign is the worst and most blatant re-election campaign for a government that this country has ever seen. It has unashamedly tapped into the public purse to pay for what is a blatant political campaign and the cost is growing at a rate that has never been seen before in the history of this parliament. The hidden truth of this GST advertising campaign needs to be exposed so the public can see what it has really cost Australians. The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline>, a fine Sydney satirical political newspaper, sums up the GST advertising situation concisely in its latest issue. I take this opportunity to thank Charles Firth and his team at the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> for exposing tax reform for what it really isâa sick joke on average Australians. Let us take a look at the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline>, which ran a centre page spread on GST advertisements in its latest issue. The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> looks at the GST and the advertising campaign comprehensively in order to explain what it really means to Australians for Australians. What do the GST ads really mean for families? The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline>, under the heading `More money for families', states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The new system includes a new advertising package that will provide extra assistance worth more than $380 million to two million(aire) families: the Packers and the Murdochs.</para><para>These Australian ... families found a benefit in several ways from the tax system.</para></quote><para>I might add that my old secretary when I was with the Metal Workers Union also has benefited from this new tax system and from the ads. She does a bit of acting around the place and I notice she has a permanent role in one of the ads in relation to how the GST affects pensioners. So she is doing pretty well out of the GST advertising.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âHas she still got her ALP membership?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âI do not think she was ever a member of the ALP. She may have been a member of a party much further to the left than the ALP. There is a bit of irony in the fact that she is getting a good quid out of the campaign that this government is running on the GST. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âYou mean the Democrats!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âYou know the old party I am referring to. Also the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> looked at how taxpayers would benefit from the GST information campaign, and under the heading `Everyone gets to pay for the ads'âwhich is trueâit says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>From 1 July, all Australian taxpayers will benefit by paying between $26 and $42 each for the privilege of receiving government propaganda in their homes. That's about 11,000 extra school teachers. Or about ten million books for our libraries. Or 3,500 funded public hospital beds.</para></quote><para>In the past, only people who were able to pay income tax would have paid for this rort by the government. But now that the GST taxes everybody who pays anything, even those who previously would have been too poor to pay tax, will now share the burden along with CEOs and company management. That is so much fairer because it means that everyone who sees this ad will have had to pay for it, not just the rich and those who can read. The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> also went on to discuss the issue of loopholes and tax avoidance and how that will operate under the GST. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline>:</para><quote><para>As before, there are exceptions. If you're rich enough to be able to employ a team of lawyers and accountants, you can easily use a myriad of New Loopholes. In fact, if you're rich enough to set yourself up as a company with an ABN, you don't even have to pay the GST on your purchasesâjust claim they were business inputs and the Government will refund you money.</para></quote><para>The article went on to look at the issue of tax cutsâthe other side of the equation of the GST. Under the heading `Every taxpayer gets an income tax cut', it reads:</para><quote><para>From July 1, all Australian taxpayers will get $12 billion worth of tax cuts. </para></quote><para>That is very significant. This government has consistently let us know loudly, and by using taxpayers' money to tell us, that there is a significant tax cut on 1 July for Australians. The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Of course, the $12 billion worth of progressive taxation will be replaced by $24 billion worth of regressive taxation, but we never said it would be fair. Oh, wait a minute, yes we did.</para><para>This tax cut immediately puts extra money in the pay packet of every Australian worker only to be taken out again as soon as you go down to the shops to buy the paper and a drink. And let's not even talk about beer.</para></quote><para>It then goes on to discuss the question of what the GST ads do for education. Again, the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> reads:</para><quote><para>Of course, our ads don't mention any of these bad things about the GSTâeven though they're the whole point.</para><para>That's because these ads are not educating people about the New Tax System itself. They're just a cynical and corrupt use of taxpayer moneyâ</para></quote><para>to save the government's backsideâ</para><quote><para>before the next election.</para></quote><para>It goes on to talk about how tax reform will impact upon families. It points out:</para><quote><para>Family assistance will increase by at least $140 per year per dependent child and the costs of having a dependent child will increase by at least double that. Which will mean that you'll be further behind than ever before. But you won't see any ads mentioning that fact ... </para></quote><para>There have been no advertisements taken out on how this GST will impact upon families, nor will you see the ACCC promoting the interests of families. If you did take out ads mentioning that fact you are more likely to see the ACCC coming down on you like a tonne of bricks. It goes on to discuss the impact of the GST on students. It says:</para><quote><para>Students of Australian educational institutions, or their parents, will have the extra benefit of an 8% subsidy on the retail price of textbooks, which will cost 10% more. That's like having the benefit of being 2% behind. And to claim the subsidy you'll have to fill out another form, of course.</para></quote><para>It then goes on to talk about the issue of how the GST will simplify the tax system. One of the major claims made by this government for introducing the GST was that it would be a simplified tax system, it would be simple and fair. It is much more complicated than the previous tax system. I think the latest weigh-in for the documentation surrounding the GST was up to 5.5 kilos. It continues to get heavier by the day. We have now reached 1,200 amendments to the original bill that was brought into this parliament with respect to the GST. The article goes on to say:</para><quote><para>One of the great benefits of tax reform is getting rid of heaps of hidden taxes that were only targeting certain sections of the community, such as high income earners or the wealthy. Taxes on everyday items like sports, cars, jewellery, land, shares and debentures. Now the poor pay as much as the rich, even though they earn less. </para><para>With one broad-based tax, that indiscriminately taxes books, cars, clothes and caviar at the one low rate, the entire effect will be to shift a higher proportion of the tax burden on to low and middle income families. Doesn't that seem fairer?</para><para>And because the tax is not hidden on receipts, unlike that nasty wholesale sales tax, people will continue to resent the GST for years and year to come, that will allow conservative politicians to keep championing lower tax cause thus eroding the revenue base of the government and ensuring our schools, hospitals and welfare system remains underfunded.</para></quote><para>This is a fairly satirical piece that the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> has done on the impact of the GST on average Australians. It was very pointed in the way in which it demonstrated in a number of key areas the impact of the GST but more importantly it demonstrated how this government used a very significant slice of taxpayers' money to promote in a propaganda way what is a dog's breakfast of a tax.</para><para>The GST, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline>, is good for the rich and bad for the rest of us. An incredible amount of taxpayers' money has been wasted in a desperate attempt by this government to minimise the political fallout from the introduction of the GST and to save their own political hides. What is clear is that the campaign is not working. Even the Prime Minister has conceded that people are tuning out and that the ads are an absolute disaster. Not only are they uninformative and blatant propaganda; they are costing the taxpayer an absolute fortune: $421 million, I think, at the latest count. </para><para>In conclusion, I want to quote to you some of the creative options that the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> identifies as alternatives on which the government could have spent the $410 millionâinstead of the GST adsâand probably would have spent it more productively. The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> has put out a package of options that could have been picked up for the $410 million. The first item on its list of options was education. As the average teacher costs about $35,000, the $410 million could have employed 11,714 new teachers, which would have made a major contribution to more literate families in our community. Significant social benefit could have been provided by the use of this advertising money. </para><para>Alternatively, if we thought we did not need more teachers, we could have used it to pay for more nurses. At a cost of around $27,000 per nurse, the <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> indicates, we could have had 15,185 more nurses in the system, the contribution being to healthier families. Alternatively, if we wanted to give a bonus to the community, we could have provided beer at $25 a case, which would have provided 16.4 million cases of beer, the result being we probably would have had much happier families running around the place. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âAnd a lot of headaches.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âThe one thing that the Prime Minister does not want to do is talk about beer.

The <inline font-style="italic">Chaser</inline> makes the point that it probably would contribute to smaller families at the end of the day if we encourage people to smoke. But you could spend the money on roads, for example: at $410,000 a kilometre, you could get another 100 kilometres of new roads, which would mean safer families.

I am not in the business of telling Senator Carr or anyone in the opposition what is discussed or not discussed in our party room but I can tell you, Madam President, that, in relation to the government's information campaign, we are on track in informing and educating the Australian people in relation to tax reform. We are on track in telling the 4.9 million pensioners out there what benefits there will be for them in the new tax reformsâa four per cent increase from 1 July in government allowances and benefitsâand for the one million self-funded retirees and the 2Â½ million businesses. I am pleased to say that the number of registrations for the ABN has exceeded our expectations, and this has been due to the information campaign that we have carried out as a government telling business of the benefits of registering for the ABN. If the opposition think that we should not be telling the people of Australia about tax reform, then they should be bold enough to say so. And next time they put an advertisement in the paper criticising our information campaign, let us see the Labor opposition tell the Australian people what they are going to do with the GST, how they are going to keep it and what parts they are going to roll back. This government makes no apology for informing the Australian people about the tax reform which is coming in on 1 July, the biggest tax reform this country has seen since World War II. </para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14816</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

In fact, the thing that families appreciate most of all is a significant increase in their real incomes. Under the current government they have had a real increase in wages of up to 9.5 per cent; on the other hand, low income workers under Labor suffered a cut of five per cent. You could not get a starker contrast than that between minus five per cent and plus 9.5 per cent, so there should not be any doubt at all of the merits of our approach. But it goes a lot further than that. I mentioned yesterday that jobs growth has been dramatic for us, particularly in terms of full-time jobsâ381,000 to date; under Labor, 27,000 full-time jobs. Of course, we have now got more than nine million Australians in jobs and the unemployment rate is down to 6.9 per cent. Of course, it got to its highest under the current world record holder, Mr Beazley, who managed to preside over an 11 per cent rate of unemployment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âExactly what John Howard did as Treasurer; exactly the same.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âI see, so John Howard back in the early 1980s was responsible for unemployment getting to 11 per cent about eight years later.

We do not see him very often these days, but at least we know he is alive. I am sure he is ashamed when he ponders Labor's record on family friendly policies, because the latest ABS figures show that families are benefiting from increased flexibility in the workplace. In fact, 68 per cent of women in the work force are now able to make flexible work arrangements with their employers. They can do it under AWAs, they can do it by direct negotiations; they do not need unions looking over their shoulders. They also appreciate the fact that apprenticeships have increased dramatically under us, that industrial disputation is down, that youth unemployment is down and that interest rates have come down. In other words, all the essential ingredients for families are there in spades. So what is the alternative from the party that has 20 per cent of the work force as its principal sponsor and yet has 60 per cent of its representatives in this parliament? A classic example that Senator Murray is probably still crying about occurred recently in an estimates hearing when he questioned the AMWU Assistant National Secretary, Mr Oliver. The AMWU is represented in this parliament by Senator Kerry O'Brien, so I am sure he agrees with this. Mr Oliver was asked, `Are you aware that you cannot intimidate a senator?' And his answer was `No.' He was not aware of that at all. He was asked `Are you threatening me?' His answer was `I'll just say no.' In other words, complete contempt bordering on perjury. He was not in the slightest bit interested in anything other than industrial muscle. He was throwing his weight around and making it crystal clear that anyone who gets in his way will be trampled on. That is not the way to deliver family friendly policies.</para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14817</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for his erudite, detailed and entertaining answer.

What I have said in this chamber and have said publicly is that neither the government nor its agency sought exclusivity, as alleged by Senator Faulkner, and that any decision by Channel 9 was entirely a decision by Channel 9.

Senator Watson asked whether there are any alternative policies. I have to say we are still not sure where the Labor Party stand on these important tax cuts. The Labor Party have been asked many times, inside and out of this chamber, to indicate whether they will guarantee in their policy the tax cuts that we are bringing in on 1 July. I have to say that each time the Labor Party refuse to answer that question. Let me make it clear that the ALP are currently engaged in a major political fraud. They attack the GST but they intend to keep it. Mr Beazley has indicated that the GST will not be repealed by the Labor Party. Yesterday we saw the shadow Treasurer waving ladies' cardigans around in question time. The question was appropriately asked in the House of Representatives whether this means that the ALP has adopted Doug Cameron's policy to roll back the GST on clothing. This would represent, I am advised, a roll-back of $1.7 billion. If they do not intend to roll it back, they should not go out and attempt to mislead the public the way they attempted to do yesterday. The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party, as I said, are indulging in the politics of deceit. Look at the confusion and the contradictions that we are now seeing. Senator Sherry in this very chamber said that we would see the tax policy at the ALP conference in July. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Crean, says that they will announce their policy just before the election. Sometimes Senator Cook is too honest, it has to be said. Senator Cook announced that major parts of their policy would in fact be announced after the election, which I must say I think is not exactly on message, but it does show, I believe, the confusion that we are seeing from the Labor Party ranks. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There is another issue which I should bring to attention. Yesterday Senator Lightfoot in his contribution said that they are not going to roll it back because they are going to increase personal income tax. Or are they going to increase company tax? Senator Cook, bless his heart, said no, they are not. So Senator Cook seems to have again gone on record stating Labor Party policy in relation to income tax and company tax. The trouble is, or perhaps the good thing is, that Senator Cook is not the Labor Party leader. It adds to the massive confusion we are seeing in Labor Party ranks. What we want to know from the Labor Party is how they can roll back the GST by billions of dollars, maintain the revenue to the states and not increase taxes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Advertisements</title><page.no>14819</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14819</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Ellison, the Special Minister of State.

It is also correct to say that they did seek some very modest additional funding in relation to Radio Australia generally, but given the extent of their budget allocation and the announcement today that they are entering into discussions with Christian Vision, presumably with a view to a commercial arrangement to lease space on that transmitter, one would assume that they regard themselves as having sufficient existing funds to meet any potential transmission costs. On that basis, it would seem to me that the ABC are able to meet those concerns out of their own resources. </para></talk.start><para>It is worth remembering the Cox Peninsula was described last year by the general manager of Radio Australia as `just one small issue that is off to the side, that should not detract from the service's other short wave and Internet coverage'. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that Cox is not needed to provide information to expats, that there are other much more effective means. In September last year, the Managing Director of the ABC put out a media release saying the web site had received almost a quarter of a million hits per week. The network manager wrote to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> saying that Radio Australia had been quick to embrace new technologies and that Radio Australia had negotiated rebroadcast deals which put its programs onto 83 radio stations in 23 countries. One can gather from that that there are indeed many other avenues open to both Radio Australia and the ABC. Indeed, the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> said last year: `The rumours of Radio Australia's death are much exaggerated.' The IT section in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in May this year stated that `Radio Australia engineers were using Internet audio technology MP3 to compress its transmissions and make them available to transmitters in Taiwan.' The general manager said that three years ago the transmitter was closed down `but now we can broadcast again on short wave and AM, at no cost to us, on someone else's air waves'. </para><para>It seems clear that the ABC is well and truly able to cope from its own resources. If it chooses to upgrade those facilities or the coverage, then that is a matter for it, but remember that back in April 1997 the government contributed an additional $7.2 million which included $1.5 million for Tok Pisin language programming, $3.2 million for English language programming and satellite costs and $2Â½ million for continuance of the short wave transmission services from Shepparton and Brandon.</para><para>Resources have been made available. Obviously, we are concerned to ensure that the message gets out, but I am sure we all remember the fact that, when Mr Mansfield handed down his report recommending that the ABC concentrate on domestic broadcasting, the ABC itself acknowledged that this was not a top priority. It was one of those items that could be included in the $55 million budget cut which was necessaryânot for singling out the ABC, but across-the-boardâto attempt to fill in Mr Beazley's $10 billion black hole.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14821</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Did you or did you not provide any extra funding? I do not think it is obvious from anything. Anybody who has looked at the ABC's funding will realise that it is not obvious that the ABC has the money for anything extra, and that includes broadcasting short wave into Asia. Did you or did you not provide for that in the ABC's public document, which you can get off the web, which says that there was a small increase in funding that would allow them to lease transmission timeâand they did mean to Taiwan, I imagine, or possibly to Singapore, even though Singapore does not like us very muchâto provide a limited quality service to targeted overseas audiences?

We provide a bottom line, one-line allocation of funds and then they determine their own priorities from within that funding envelope. To the extent that they identify upgrading Radio Australia as a priority for them, then of course they have the capacity within the budget allocation to accommodate that. You may recall that, when we granted that additional $7.2 million, the ABC board itself chose to provide, from memory, a couple of million dollars to assist in that process. It is ultimately a matter for the ABC board to determine its own priorities from within the single-line allocation.

The community is suspicious of government help, which they see as intervention. There is a long history of differences between various important stakeholders, whether they be the pastoral industry, the fishing industry, conservationists or indigenous interests. Nevertheless, the strategy that we finally agreed on was a good strategy and we set about the task of implementing it in cooperation with the Queensland government. This required the setting up of a structure for that implementation and that was put in place. </para></talk.start><para>Pursuant to that strategy, a number of projects have been approved and implemented: important practical projects to do with nature conservation and reducing feral animals. In regard to pigs, in particular, I can recall a project in cooperation with the council at Cooktown. Most importantly, a process was put in place for property planning assessments which would look at ways in which the interests of pastoralists, indigenous people and conservationists could be effectively achieved. Ten pilot projects were selected and a technical team was set up and funded. That team has been implementing the process of developing these property plans. They are not completed as yet, but we expect them to provide a model which will then be appropriate for use over the rest of the cape. It is complex because each party is looking for a different outcome in these agreements. The indigenous interests are obviously looking for better protection of native title rights and other matters that are important to them. Pastoralists want greater security of tenure than they currently have in their existing leases. Conservationists are obviously looking for proper protection of what is a unique and very special natural environment.  </para><para>I received a draft of that report, I think it was late last year.

The new endowment to mark the Centenary of Federation will be given to the newly formed Foundation for Young Australians. The Foundation for Young Australians is an amalgamation of the Australian Youth Foundation and the Queen's Trust for Young Australians. The foundation will use the $15 million to fund a range of practical initiatives for young people. The scholarships will be available for both undergraduate and postgraduate study in academic and vocational areas. The scholarships will be valued at $10,000 per annum for each recipient. Priority will be given to disadvantaged youth, especially from rural and regional areas. These young people are particularly disadvantaged in their access to tertiary education. Family income in rural and regional Australia is below the national average and students have to travel and board away from home. There is often a lack of community and family support in the areas that they have to move to for their studies. </para></talk.start><para>This comes on the back of a great deal of success and progress that we have achieved in government in relation to education, and particularly in relation to higher education. We have now 42,000 more people in higher education than in Labor's last year of office. This is good news for Australians, and especially those younger Australians who want to go on to tertiary education. There is a total of almost 465,000 full-time equivalent students studying at Australian universities, and of course there is even greater opportunity and choice for those students than there has been previously. This has been backed up by $49 million that the Howard government paid to universities for enrolment in 1999. Under Labor, not one cent was provided for additional funding for overenrolment. This is a great step forward in relation to providing extra places for those people who want to study in tertiary education institutions. </para><para>When Mr Beazley was education minister, he spent his time telling university applicants to go somewhere else. This government is not. This government is committed to making sure that all Australians are able to reach their full potential. We have already seen this in the outstanding success of the New Apprenticeships scheme where we have a record number of people in formal training in Australiaâand, of course, that spells good news, particularly for young Australians who want to embark on training. We have seen this in our higher education enrolment figures. I have pointed to that previously: greater opportunity and choice for those Australians who want to go on to tertiary studies, particularly young Australians. </para><para>This new foundation will continue on the excellent work done by its predecessors. This is a more than fitting way to celebrate the Centenary of Federation. It is indeed a great initiative which demonstrates the crucial value of community partnerships in the continued development of the Australian community.

But not only that: the government are becoming more desperate in their approach. They are resorting to misuse of the electoral roll for a mail-out and they are also resorting to knocking competing views to those of the Howard government off the media. The bill is mounting, as Mr Howard and his Liberal lackey in the Australian Taxation Office, Mark Pearson, throw taxpayers' dollars down the drain promoting, publicising and selling the GST. That amount of money has reached in excess of $430 million.  </para><para>What has happened now is that the government have tried to knock other advertisements off the media. The irony of the brewers' ads is that they are not advertisements directly related to the GST at all; in fact, it is actually an excise issueâbut no matter. The Howard government have been shown to be so desperate to keep these ads off prime time television that they are willing to splash out with hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars to sponsor a prime time first run movie just to gazump the launch of the brewers' advertisements. That is what has happened. We all know that the brewers had planned to launch their ads on Sunday, 28 May. They had had media space, air space, booked for well over a week. When the government found out about the brewers' launch timing and they realised the danger of the ads running during the highest rating television program for the week, what did they do? They sponsored the movie with massive extra expense borne by Australian taxpayers. </para><para>How many times was the Special Minister of State asked in Senate question time today about whether there were sponsorship arrangements in relation to the evening of Sunday, 28 May? Not once would the minister answer those questions. He would not tell us whether there has been a sponsorship deal. He would not tell us whether the weasel words that he uses, `program advertising package', are actually another term for sponsorship. He would not front up to the Senate and give us that information. He would not deny that `sponsorship' amounts, in fact, to `exclusivity'. Of course, that is what we are talking about here: sponsorship deal meaning exclusivity. </para><para>We know that such a sponsorship carries a hefty premium over and above the normal advertising rates. The opposition has been advised that that sort of premium is normally about 100 per cent extra. We know that the sponsorship entitled the government to exclusivityâthat no ads seen to be in competition with the government's political propaganda on the GST, on the chains ads, could run in that timeslot. But how could the ads be in competition if the chains ads were truly an information campaign, as the government claim; as they assert? There could not be any competition to an information campaign. How could there be competition to so-called information? Of course, there is a competitive situation when you are trying to sell somethingâin this case, peddling political propaganda on the GST. That is what the government are doing through a misuse of $430 million of taxpayers' moneyâpeddling propaganda on the GST.

Labor has been in a lather for weeks over the GST and these ads. It is extraordinary. Is Labor really suggesting that there is no obligation on the government to inform the Australian people about the most significant tax changes this country has ever seen? What we have not been told about the much impugned $430 million is that $200 million of it has been spent on the business assistance program, not on advertising. Is the Labor Party seriously suggesting that there should not be information about the ABN or information to assist businesses to make the conversion? This is the most extraordinary proposition that I have heard for a very long time.</para></talk.start><para>The other thing about the impugned $430 million is that $30 million of it was also spent on something that was an absolutely bipartisan policy of the Labor Party and the government for a very long timeâon the PAYG system and on the ABN. It is an utterly defensible program. Those listening to this debate would be interested to know that the new tax system not only affects the whole Australian community but it affects people in different ways. There are 18 million consumers, and there are 2.5 million businesses requiring 2.2 million ABNs. There are 4.9 million pensioners and other income benefit recipients, 2.2 million families who receive government assistance, and one million self-funded retirees. The same ad and the same information does not really affect everybody equally. Targeted information is utterly defensible; in fact, it would be remiss of the government not to engage in this program. </para><para>Senator Faulkner went into some extraordinary niceties about what are premiums and what are normal prices. First of all, it is not at all clear what a `normal' price might be, and it is certainly not clear what a premium on top of the normal price might be. Senator Faulkner seems to be suggesting that, somehow or other, sponsorship can be implied. There is absolutely nothing in any answer from the minister, or any information that was given in the Senate earlier, which would allow that inference to be drawn. There is certainly no contractual obligation. The minister said very clearly that the government did not seek exclusivity, that the agency did not seek exclusivity and that that had been checked. Prime time advertising space to educate the Australian public on the tax system had been purchased in the normal course and through the normal processes, and for no other reason than to communicate important information on tax reform. The attack on what is normal practice of block booking simply disguises Labor's threadbare policies on tax, or indeed on anything else for that matter.

The Australian people ought to be well aware that, if the GST is rolled back, it has to be paid for somehow. Either there will have to be an increase in income tax to pay compensation, or it will mean raiding the budget surplus to pay compensation, or it will mean another special levy or reinstating the GST. I suggest that it would not be safe to leave the national economy alone in the same room with the ALP, and that is exactly what will happen if Labor get their hands on the Treasury benches ever again in this country.

We should send the tape of today's question time to central casting. Mike Myers, move aside. You have Chris Ellison, the Special Minister of State in Australia, to rival you in a spoof on ministerial responsibility in answering questions directly, honestly and forthrightly when they are put in this chamber. What we have seen is a minister twisting in the wind, trying to find every which way to avoid the point.</para><para>The facts are that the brewers had organised this campaign. It embarrassed the government. The government has obtained exclusivity by whatever means at a higher than normal cost to blank out the brewers ads and to put on their unchained ads, which in themselves are a vast rip-off of Australian taxpayers and the most gross campaign that has ever been conducted on public television by a government. It did so because it wanted to stop the embarrassing ads, and it did so because it was happy to plunder the public purse and to make taxpayers pay for political censorship in order to do so. The extra premium is to pay for government propaganda. There is nothing here at all about education. </para><para>The fact is that the brewers had the booking for prime time. The fact is that on 26 May, the Friday before the Sunday night viewing, in came the government insisting on their unchained ads, and winning exclusive rights. The fact is that their exclusivity dislodged the ads that the Australian brewers wanted. Game, set and match to the government. You might have thought behind your hand, `What a smart move this is!' The mask has slipped. When the minister talks about a program advertising package he embraces within that: the cost of a standard advertisement, the extra premium you pay on a standard advertisement in order to get prime time, the additional premium you pay on top of that prime time special levy for exclusivity, and the additional premium you pay on top of all of that because you have a late booking. The minister was invited to explain what these extra costs were. Did he answer the question? In a spoof on ministerial responsibility he evaded the question not once, not twice, but at least three or four times. Questions now have to be asked not only about what the government did but also the propriety of a minister who declines to actually fess up and be honest in this chamber as to what the facts are.</para><para>Minister Ellison chose his words very carefully. If you read what he said and compare it to the questions that were asked, you can see he is preparing a defence argument for himself in case the facts do come out. But the facts are, at base, once again: when the government does something that in its conscience it knows is crook, rather than admit that it has done something crook, it covers up. The mistake is in covering up. If you had admitted it, if you had corrected it, if you had moved aside and let the brewers ads continue, if you had not plundered the public purse to pay for political propaganda and if you had conducted yourselves appropriately, there would be some understanding on this point. But, because you have covered up, you have compounded the evil of what you have tried to do and shown how bankrupt the whole position is.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>14831</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe people of Australia have just witnessed one of the most pathetic performances in this chamber by a Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

If they were to be reminded, they would be reminded of such people as Laurie Oakes saying that Senator Faulkner wanted to be a Graham Richardson but that he emerged rather like a Ros Kelly.

He is only remembered for famous quotes which have had to be expunged, I understand, from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record.

We know they have one policy: if elected, and heaven help this country if they are ever elected, what they would do is keep the GST. They hate it so much they will keep the GST and they will keep the tax reforms. Indeed, just before lunch, speaker after speaker from the Australian Labor PartyâSenator Crossin and othersâcondemned, allegedly, the tax reform for local government. They were very impassioned speeches. But then they finished their speeches by saying, `We will support the legislation.' How duplicitous can one get? You condemn the tax reforms being proposed by this government but then you say, `We will keep those reforms if ever we are elected.' </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate asked some six questions, I understand, of Senator Ellison. Senator Ellison responded in a detailed manner to each and every one of them. And no matter how much Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook try to twist and turn, they cannot get around the unequivocal answer given by Senator Ellison. He said that the government did not seek nor did it pay a premium for exclusivity for its tax reform advertising campaign. End of story. If you have proof to the contrary, present it. But do not go sneaking around trying to create innuendo by asking questions when you know what the answer is. You have been given the answer. It is time for the Australian Labor Party to put up or shut up. The fact is that they cannot put up so I would invite them on this occasion, yet again, to shut up and get on with the real business of a bit of policy development.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>14832</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have heard from the two coalition wannabes today: Senators Coonan and Abetz.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âYou are a has-been. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âI am happy to say that the best part of my career is behind me. But at least I made it, Senator Abetz, while you are still sycophantically crawling around the Prime Minister, hoping for the phone call. I have to say to the Senate: Senator Abetz is sixth in line for the ministry. That is pretty impressiveâto be sixth in line The reason he is sixth in line is that every government must have a Tasmanian minister. When Senator Newman goes off into the sunset at some stage, who is left? Senator Abetz has made sure there are not many. Through his poisonous activities in the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party, they have lost all House of Representatives seats. Every one he has touched is lost. Then he went into the last Senate election, and they barely got two quotas after preferences. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Abetz factor has destroyed the Liberal Party in Tasmania. But when the Prime Minister has to look for a future minister there, who can they look towards? No-one other than Senator Abetz. Already Senator Calvert is whip; Senator Gibson has been tried and found wanting; Senator Watson would be too dubious a proposition, because Senator Abetz is trying to backdoor him and destroy his career. So all we get out of Senator Abetz is this sycophantic fawning on the Prime Minister. Senator Coonan, on the other hand, I am not going to give a character reference to one way or the other, because she is involved in an upcoming preselection and, frankly, I am not going to take sides. I wish them both well. </para><para>I want to go to the question that I asked Senator Ellison, because Senator Abetz said we got detailed answers today.

No answer. We cannot get answers on this. We have gone to estimates committees and we have had the tax office in front of us: not one of those officials can remember whose idea it was. They do not own up to it themselves, but they cannot remember. Let me assist them. If you had made a decision just a few weeks ago to spend $10 million on an unprecedented mail-out, using the AEC database for the first time, you would think someone in government would remember it. When you are using what is a very sophisticated political tool, it does not come by accident. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have got some suggestions to make about where these ideas came from. They came from the Prime Minister's office. They came from their paid party lackey, Mark Pearson, who is being paid $195,000 to coordinate the GST campaignâthe very same Mark Pearson who directed the advertising campaign for the Liberal Party in the 1996 and 1998 elections. He was not even on the database of the Government Communications Unit. Of all the hundreds of people they could have chosen to do this job, they picked the insider, they picked the Liberal stooge. He is, in fact, responsible, along with the Prime Minister's office, for this direct mail-out. Why not a household delivery?

You are our trump card, Senator Abetz. Your undermining and backstabbing in the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party has helped deliver five House of Representatives seats, five Labor senators, and it has ensured that Senators Harradine and Brown came into this chamber.

I asked Senator Alston, in essence, whether the government had funded or intended to fund the ABC for Radio Australia to be broadcast by short wave into Asia. I do not think Senator Alston actually answered that question; however, by his not answering that question, I assume the answer to be no. I assume the answer to be that the government has not funded Radio Australia to be broadcast by short wave into Asia and does not intend to do so. I assume that if they did fund them or if they intended to fund them, he would have told me so. So that obviously has not happened.</para><para>I was scribbling furiously as Senator Alston answeredâor made a commentary onâmy question, and I will just respond to a few of the things he said. He said, first of all, that one would assume that the ABC regard themselves as having sufficient resources to be able to broadcast by short wave into Asia. I do not think that one can assume that at all. I think that because of the fact that they asked for extra resources to be able to do that and the fact that they have been cut down in their funding over the past several years since this government came into officeâcut down to a point where they are absolutely, thoroughly, inadequately funded for everything, and especially for the services of Radio Australia into our neighbouring regionâone can assume that they do not have sufficient funds to go into Asia on short wave. I think everybody would be making that assumption, except this minister. He said that DFAT say that they do not need Radio Australia by short wave to tell expatriates what is going on in countries in times of needâor words to that effect. I guess he asked DFAT about that. He said to DFAT, `Do you have the necessary resources'âand I urge him to tell me if I am saying the wrong thingâ`to tell our expatriates that they need to be somewhere else if there is danger?' And I guess DFAT said yes. I cannot imagine they are going to say no. </para><para>DFAT is very good at a lot of things but we do not have the money to have DFAT officers out in the countryside of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, southern China, India or anywhere elseâall of them out there in the countrysideâtelling our expats that they should be somewhere else in times of trouble. They say, `Listen to Radio Australia,' but you cannot anymore and you certainly will not be able to after August, when the Taiwan transmitter is turned off to Radio Australia. You will not have any short wave: there will be no short wave from Radio Australia going out into Asiaânone, full stopâunless the money is forthcoming. It does not sound to me, from what Senator Alston said today, that the money will be forthcoming. I hope I am wrong.</para><para>The next thing he said was that the web site has had a quarter of a million hits. I assume that is over a year and I assume that is worldwide. A quarter of a million is nothing like the audience that was accepted for Radio Australia in Asiaâin South-East Asia, China, Indonesia and India. This is our neighbourhood. As for all these people, even though the use of the Internet is going up in this area, it is not going up anywhere near what you can have with short-wave radio. I have a short-wave radio that I take with me overseas. I do not know why I bother taking it to Asia anymore; I will not after August. It cost me $40-odd. It costs a lot more money to be connected to the Internet, and most people in South-East Asia do not have it. So that one is useless. He told us there are rebroadcast deals. Yes, there are. In most of those countries in Asia `rebroadcast' does not include news and current affairs, because they are considered too sensitive. They are also the most important parts. They are also the things people most want to hear about their own countryâwhat is really going onâand often do not know. So rebroadcast deals are very sensitive, very delicate and usually do not include news and current affairs.</para><para>He mentioned the Mansfield report and said what that reportedâthank you very much, we all know that Mr Mansfield was not asked to report on this. Mr Mansfield reported on this off his own bat without any submissions on it. In fact, he did get a few submissions on it but he got them because people just decided to write in. He did not ask for submissions on it; he reported on this just because that was how he felt like he should report. Finally, Senator Alston said he thought I would be screaming blue murder if he tried to direct the ABC. He tries to direct the ABC all the time: I scream blue murder all the time, most of this parliament, including his own side, screams blue murder all the time when he does it. People are screaming blue murder now because there is no funding for short wave for Radio Australia into Asia and there should be.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>14834</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection of Bills Committee</title><page.no>14834</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>14834</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>14834</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Calvert, I present report No. 8 of 2000 of the Selection of Bills Committee. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âI also seek leave to have the report incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The report read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT NO. 8 OF 2000</inline></para><para>1.

The problem is that the federal government have responded in a manner which is too little, too late. They have addressed one issue amongst a host of issues which concern sugar growers in Queensland. They have addressed one issue which is important in one local area. But in terms of the crisis which is facing the whole sugar industry in Queensland and in northern New South Wales, it is a minor issue compared with all the issues which are vexing sugar growers in those areas at the moment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to deal with the issue of the South Johnstone millâand I will get to that in a minuteâbecause I think there are some things that need to be said about the government's action on that issue. Having met with sugar growers and people concerned about the sugar industry on the Atherton Tableland, in South Johnstone, in Ayr and in other parts of Queensland in the last couple of months, I can tell you that there are many issues which the federal government is simply not addressing at all.</para><para>I am going to read into the record some of the issues which have been put on the record in all those places, and I did not mention Ingham, where I spent at least a day with those people. They all asked me to bring the message to Canberra that, while the federal government is addressing one issue amongst manyâthe issue of the South Johnstone millâmany other issues are vexing the minds of these sugar growers and in fact there is a very deep crisis in the Australian sugar industry. Fixing up the South Johnstone sugar mill, whilst it is welcome in that area, is simply not going to save the sugar industry in this country. I want to put on the record some of the things I discovered, and in fact I will read into the record some of the things which were given to me in writing. But first of all, let me address the issue of the South Johnstone sugar mill. I read from the minister's press release: </para><quote><para>âThe Federal Government has offered to underwrite Canegrowers for a loan to provide the necessary capital to enable the crush to proceed on schedule next month,â Mr Truss said.</para></quote><para>It is good that they did that. But let me relate what I discovered when I visited South Johnstone. I want to ask whether the federal government's initiative will actually address, even in that local area, all the issues that surround the problems in the South Johnstone mill. One of the problems is to do with the whole area of preparation to open the mill, which takes quite a bit of time, a bit of capital and also a lot of work. I discovered that none of those preparations have been able to begin. There is a problem with the drainage into the creek system, and that has not been cleared for a number of years. There is the problem of maintenance of the tracks which lead into the mill and carry much of the sugar. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âWhat are we supposed to do?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âThere is an incredible problem in terms of roads, Senator Boswell, particularly up on the Atherton Tableland, as much of the sugar that is being grown in the southern Atherton Tableland comes into the South Johnstone mill. The roads are falling apart. So these are some of the issuesâSenator Boswell might like to address them in his contributionâand I need to know whether or not they are being addressed by the government in addressing this one particular issue in the sugar industry in North Queensland. I wonder whether that mill's debt is going to be just too big to jump over and whether this is just a temporary relief for this year. I wonder whether the federal government is prepared to put in funding. I could give a figure but, because that could be commercial-in-confidence, I will not mention it. But I understand that the debt on the mill is very large indeed. Part of this was caused by the mill's purchase of land near Tully from the King Ranch, and that itself increased the debt. I visited a number of businesses in South Johnstone and there are many of them ready to close their doors. Is the federal government's package for South Johnstone really going to address those issues? That is the question that needs to be answered.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me note that it says in the minister's press release on the South Johnstone sugar mill that `cane farmers in North Queensland are currently facing a difficult situation with poor seasonal weather'. I certainly do not expect the federal government to be able to do anything about that, Senator Boswell. But let me say that low prices and a corrupt world market are mentioned in the minister's press release, and I have to ask whether or not the federal government is taking enough account of that. The problem is that, once we removed the very small tariff which helped to support the domestic price for sugar in Queensland and we moved to export parity pricing, immediately we exposed the sugar growers in North Queensland to that corrupt world market. That meant that not only our export sugar but also sugar sold into the domestic market, which is about 20 per cent of the market, had to cop a price which is just unsustainable. This is one place where the Democrats disagree strongly with the major parties, in that we believe that domestic markets at least ought to be supported by government and that, while we are subject to export markets and it is difficult to do anything about the prices that we get for our export product, in terms of our domestic markets we do have control over the price. To expose domestic markets to that same export parity pricing means that growers cannot, even in their own domestic market, control the price that they get.</para><para>I notice that the minister said:</para><quote><para>The loan is dependent on the growers contributing to a 5 per cent levy on their proceeds for the next two seasons' supply, as already agreed. </para></quote><para>I again ask whether the assistance that the government says it is giving is really about farmers themselves paying for their own government assistance. I notice also that Mr Truss said:</para><quote><para>By the end of this year a plan must be in place to rationalise industry infrastructure.

While the middle people, the processors and refiners, are getting cheaper sugar, at the same time consumers are paying more to buy sugar in the supermarket, more for soft drinks and more for confectionery.

Mr Allison, General Manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, said that he believed the general industry would accept the report as a `united, solid approach to the future direction of the industry'. In so doing, he believes the report `reflects the maturity of the industry'. That is a report from one of the industry's peak bodies supporting the removal of the tariff.

Together with 13 other sugar producing countries, the global alliance of sugar producers supports the government's efforts and shares the aim of dismantling tariffs and non-tariff barriers and the elimination of all export subsidies and trade distortions that provide domestic price support for sugar. Average tariffs are three times higher for agriculture than for non-agriculture goods. It seems beyond comprehension that in US terms $362 billion was given to farmers in wealthier countries last year to support less than three per cent of their economies. The EU, Japan and America support their farmers by $362 billion. I ask Senator Woodley: does he think that with our economy, if we get into a subsidy war, we can possibly match those subsidies? The sugar industry do not think so. They think the only way out is to try to remove trade barriers. They think that, and 13 other leading sugar industry countries think it. The only way through to them is to reduce the tariff barriers and get out there. Senator Woodley, I do not know whether you were here at the time, but when the embargo was lifted it was I who called for a Senate inquiry and actually did something.

When I opened the conference three weeks ago, I announced there would be no 43c excise on ethanol. That was greeted with great acclamation. The government has made it a policy position that there would be no ethanol excise and that has shown the way forward for a positive, new industry based on sugar. We have supported the bagasse cogeneration. We have put a very substantial package into that, to plough electricity back into the grid from the by-product, bagasse, burnt off in their furnaces. There probably would not be a week go by when I would not speak to this industry once or twice a week, either the Australian Cane Farmers or the Australian Canegrowers. I cannot recall anything that we have not responded to as a government. When they wanted the single desk legislation placed, it was this government that stopped the native title debate to squeeze through an amendment on the Trade Practices Act that would put the single desk selling in place in the best way possible under legislation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>âUntil national competition policy reviews it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>âThe national competition policy cannot review it at all, because it is in legislation put into this parliament, put in by this government, rock solid and cemented in.

Senator Woodley, I appeal to you. I know what you are doing. You are playing base, crude politics. You are going to some of the industry, but not the leaders of the industry, the people that are elected to represent their industry. I did not see you at the conference. You were not even there. I take it that you would have got an invitation, but you were not there. You do not want to deal with the elected leaders. You want to find some people that are hurt and downtrodden and you want to take them back into the fifties. Senator Woodley, you cannot do it. Ninety per cent of the sugar crop of Australia is exported. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>14844</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am just amazed at that contribution from Senator Boswell. About three-quarters of it was a personal attack on Senator Woodley and by implication an attack upon all the other members of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. On a number of occasions, often at the suggestion of members of the government, the Senate committee has conducted inquiries into a range of agricultural industries, including this industry, and brought down unanimous reports in just about all cases. But Senator Boswell thinks that is a waste of taxpayers' money. He probably thinks the report we brought down the other day on the salmon industry was a waste of taxpayers' money, even though members of both coalition parties took a very active interest in that inquiry, which travelled around various parts of Australia.  </para></talk.start><para>Senator Boswell also tried to make out that this was a problem that really only arose a couple of weeks ago. He said that it has only been in the last three or four weeks that the issue of the crisis in the sugar industry really came before the government. I do not know where Senator Boswell has been. If, as he said, not a week goes by when he does not talk to the industry once or twice, then he must have heard about the concerns within the sugar industry, about the parlous state of their industry because of low world prices. This is not something that has been hidden in the back pages. You only have to pick up the <inline font-style="italic">Land</inline> newspaper or get onto the net sites or even contact the Parliamentary Library here and you will get reams and reams of paper. Senator Boswell can keep in touch with what is happening in the industry whilst he is sitting in this chamber, let alone go and talk to them.</para><para>This problem has been around for a couple of years. At the ABARE Outlook conference earlier this year, ABARE predicted a substantial further drop in world sugar prices: world sugar prices for the year 1999-2000 would end up being about 16 per cent lower than they were last year. Further, as the industry associations themselves have been saying for some time, historically low world prices, record production levels over a number of years and the highly regulated industries in the EU and America have brought about huge production levels, far exceeding consumption. Our industry has been suffering for some time as a result. It has not just come to light because of the situation at the South Johnstone mill. The situation at the South Johnstone mill is the end result of a problem that has been around for at least a couple of years. </para><para>The minister, Mr Truss, and other members of the government have been aware of this. They have visited these areas, like other members of parliament, and they have been informed of the problem. An added problem in Queenslandâon top of the other ones I have mentionedâhas been the huge rainfall and the floods and the devastating cyclone, particularly Cyclone Rona. This industry has copped everything. Even an industry as efficient as the sugar industry is going to have trouble coping when it gets hit with four or five problems such as the ones I have identified. </para><para>Mr Truss, the minister, visited the Burdekin region, I am advised, in August of last year. An article in the local newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Ayr Advocate,</inline> on 25 August described his visit as `a lacklustre visit'. The farmers up there did not get any comfort from Mr Truss's visit at that time. His response to requests from the industry for assistance was, in the words of the newspaper article, `You are on your own.' Parliamentary secretary for agriculture, Senator Judith Troeth, told the sugar industry on 6 September last year that the solution to its problems lay in further tightening its belt. She said about the sugar industry: `It has to find ways of reducing on-farm costs.' This statement was made to an industry which is widely acknowledged as being one of the most efficient in the world. It has not had the levels of protection that exist in the EU and in the US. The PM is on the record as saying that he sympathises with the plight of the sugar industry and the farmers but that it was really all Bill Clinton's fault or the WTO's fault because they did not get any resolution in Seattle. He was hoping things would get better, maybe after the next US presidential elections. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>âWhat about the next Australian election? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âI have no doubt that things will get better for all Australia after the next federal election. In the last few weeks the situation at South Johnstone mill has reached a critical point. The government has been forced to act. Minister Truss announced on 2 June a loan package to assist that mill. The government is talking to the industry about a broader and longer lasting package, we understand. But once again it has been far too late.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a government that has not been proactive when it needed to be. We saw that in the dairying industry. Minister Truss sat on his hands for months and months. The same attitude was adopted that Senator Boswell has just acknowledged here today. The government's attitude to the industry is `If you get into trouble and it is not your fault, if your industry gets hit with world economic problems and cyclones and all these things, you have to develop a plan and then bring it to us.' The attitude of this government is that it will sit here and wait until the industry develops the plan. God knows, they have enough to do to survive. That is what happened in the dairying industry. </para><para>There is nothing about this government, and particularly this minister, that would give any confidence to agricultural industries that the government will take notice of the advice they get from their department, or from ABARE, a specialist body, or that the government is maybe going start to think ahead, to think, `Maybe this industry is going to need some assistance, maybe this industry is going to need a plan to help it restructure and survive.' Noâit sits back and waits, unlike the previous Labor government. As a government we developed plans for industry in consultation and cooperation with industry: the Kerin plan, the Crean plan, and the Button plan for the motor vehicle industry. </para><para>We did not sit back and just wait till industry finally came crawling through the door on their knees, saying: `Please help us.' We did not say, `You go away and develop a plan, bring it back to us and we will think about whether or not we can support it.' And if they do happen to support it, what will happen? This government will claim the credit for it. They claimed the credit for the dairying industry restructure plan, even though it was never their idea and it is being funded ultimately by taxpayers and by the industry itself. So we can criticise this government. They are far too tardy. They have come to this issue, again, far too late. </para><para>I want to make another point: whilst this proposal is certainly welcome for the South Johnstone mill, there are other mills in danger of closing and there are workers at those mills who are in danger of losing their jobs. We should not be focusing purely on the situation in terms of the farmers. For instance, the workers at the South Johnstone mill have for a number of months been working reduced hours by agreement between the union and the management to help reduce some of the costs of that mill in order to help it to survive. They have been aware of the problem and they have been accepting reduced working hours and, therefore, lower take-home pay in order to help the mill. It is about time Minister Truss started to recognise that he has a responsibility as a minister to think forward, not backwards, to not just be reactive but to start to get proactive in dealing with some of the very important issues and some of the problems that exist within his portfolio, particularly in the sugar industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>14846</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking in this debate, perhaps I should first of all declare an interest, as I am required to do. I am the only senator in this chamber who has a direct interest in the sugar industry. That is because my biggest investment, like the biggest investment of most Australians, is my residence in the town of Ayr, in the very successful sugar growing district of the Lower Burdekin, Ayr, Home Hill and Giru. These cyclical difficulties that the sugar industry has been facing impact not only on home owners like meâthe value of my house falls quite considerably when sugar prices are lowâbut also on small businesses in areas that rely on sugar for their livelihood. Whilst we, in this debate, talk about the sugar industry as such, there is a wider difficulty for all those people who rely on the sugar industry right up the coast of Queensland and the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales.</para></talk.start><para>The government recognises that if the sugar industry were to be in real difficulty and to hypothetically foldâI am sure that will not happenâit is not only the farmers who will suffer but all the townspeople and all the people who have businesses in those areas and all the people who work in the mills or who work in councils or who work in other businesses that rely on the sugar industry. The government has been very concerned about that over the years. I have to say that Minister Truss has done a very good job in managing, in negotiating and in working with the sugar industry. Whilst I appreciate that Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley from their homes in the capital citiesâSenator Forshaw in Sydney and Senator Woodley in Brisbaneâmean well, it is obvious from their contributions to this debate that they really have no idea of the sugar industry or how it operates. </para><para>The sugar industry has over a long period of time been one of the better organised rural industries, and it has a very professional, aggressiveâI say `aggressive' in a positive wayâand forward-looking group of industry leaders right across the state of Queensland, which is the state I know best. These people do not get up like Senator Woodley or Senator Forshaw and wave their hands and promise the world when they know they cannot deliver it. They sit down and rationally go through the difficulties. They understand that the problems in the sugar industry at this time are to do with world prices being at a very low level. But they know, as I know, and as people who are involved in the industry know, that that is a cyclical problem. You will have times when the sugar industry is very buoyant; you will have times when it is very low. We happened to be, at the present time, at one of those very low points with world prices on the overseas market.</para><para>There are additional difficulties at this time, particularly north of Townsville in the Ingham, Herbert River, Tully and Babinda area where exacerbating the very low world prices are four years of absolutely unseasonal rainfall. Senator Forshaw would not understand, but the way the rain has fallen at the wrong time of year and very heavily for four years in a row has meant that the cane has become waterlogged. Rain has come at the wrong time and when the sugar should be generated within the cane stick, it is not being generated because of the rain. The result of this is that the sugar content of cane is much lower in those areas particularly than it has been elsewhere. So there are real problems, and that is one of the difficulties that has happened with the mill at Innisfail. That section of the industry is in very great difficulties. There has been some restructuring in recent times. A lot of farmers in that Innisfail-Tully area have gone on to bananas and other crops, which they have found consistently more profitable than sugar. But there is still a huge infrastructure in sugar, and the towns, businesses and people's livelihoods that need to be supported.</para><para>That is why this government has contributed quite a substantial amount of money over the period in support of the sugar industry. We have provided some $33 million in recent times for much needed support for the industry. Money has been provided for a variety of projects, including research, infrastructure, development and renewable energy. A package of about $13Â½ million dollars is being spent by the federal government over four years for research into increasing the sugar content levels of cane and related priority research. That is very important to the issue I was talking about. I could spend most of my speech going through and relating the financial assistance the government has given in any number of ways to the industry, but I want to go on to other issuesâthat is, to look sensibly at where we are going.</para><para>I heard bits and pieces of Senator Woodley's speech, and I agree with Senator Boswell that Senator Woodley picks up some people who have a particular concern. They are not usually sugar industry leaders. As I said, the leaders in every town are a very professional, forward-looking group of people who sit down with governments and understand that no government ever is going to come along and offer them buckets of money in subsidy. The federal governmentâincluding me, my Liberal colleague who represents the northern electorate of Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay, Bob Katter and De-Anne Kellyâhave done some work. There is a lot of government commitment going into finding the right results and working cooperatively with the sugar industry leaders, not listening to those who really seek the Pauline Hanson response, which is, of course, no response at all. Regrettably, Senator Woodley has fallen into that trap and is, I would suggest, being perhapsâI will not say `manipulated'âused by some people not in the best interests of the long-term viability of the sugar industry. </para><para>The government is working with the sugar industry leaders, cane growers and the Australian Cane Farmers Association to come up with some sort of package that will tide the industry over. Senator Forshaw derided the government for working with the industry. Let me tell Senator Forshaw this: it is far better having the industry work these things out than for he public servants in Canberra to do so. The industry will work through this much better than the public servants in Canberra. You were deriding this government for relying on the industry to come forward with an approach to the industry. We continue to work regularly with the industry, because we are there and we interact with Warren Entsch, Bob Katter, Peter Lindsay, De-Anne Kelly, Warren Trussâfrom a sugar electorateâMr Neville and the members in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales. As a government we are currently working with the industry. We said to them, `Times move on. Much as we would like to go back to the days when a farm with a couple of thousand tonne peak could make a fair living out of the sugar industry, those days are gone. You now have to look at broadacre farms with 10,000, 20,000, even 100,000 tonne of cane as their contribution to the mill.' That is the way the industry has to go, and that is understoodâyou cannot move backwards. Regrettably, that is not going to be in the best interests of every single person. But the industry has this realism. They know that they have to work sensibly towards a resolution. They are working with the government. They are looking at the best way to restructure. We as a government and the minister, Mr Truss, will work very cooperatively with them to make sure that we do get the very best result possible for the sugar industry in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>14848</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to follow the minister, Senator Macdonald, particularly given the comments that he made because I wanted to deal with some of the very matter that he raised. He referred to some of the government's programsâthe millions of dollars that the government is allegedly laying out to assist the sugar industryâand the solutions that this government has for the sugar industry. The last round of estimates was most revealing as to how the government generally and the minister for agriculture, in particular, go about their business. Firstly, in last year's budget the government set itself a range of performance targets, and those targets were set for programs designed to assist the sugar industry. But when I sought advice from the department as to exactly what those targets were for 1999-2000 and how the government performed against those targets, the answers I received were certainly not illuminating. To me, they were alarming, and I am sure that they would have alarmed cane growers and processors. For example, as you will see from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of Monday, 22 May, on page 67 of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I asked:</para></talk.start><quote><para>On page 53 of last year's PBS a number of performance targets were set for the Sugar Industry Program and the Sugar Industry Assistance Package.</para></quote><para>Mr Wonder said:</para><quote><para>This was from the 1999-2000 PPS?</para></quote><para>I said:</para><quote><para>Yes. The performance indicator for the package was given as `a more competitive cost structure and increased productivity'. Firstly, what baseline data was to be used to measure the performance indicator?</para></quote><para>I essentially put to Dr Samson, who was answering the questions, that the baseline data may be found in the annual reports, and Dr Samson said, `I would expect so.' He did not know. I then said:</para><quote><para>Dr Samson, when you say `I would expect so', does that mean that the statement in the PBS last year did not actually have in mind a performance indicator for the package?</para></quote><para>Mr Roseby then jumped in to try to protect his fellow public servant, and said:</para><quote><para>The programs had performance objectives. At that stage we probably did not have baseline data. </para></quote><para>He later said:</para><quote><para>It is an interesting question as to how you would say to what extent, in terms of baseline data, this industry has improved. We do not have figures to say that their cost structures have come down at this stage, because a lot of these projects are under way, but it would be certainly in that area, where you are looking at the efficiency of the handling and the processing operations, which we would expect to derive from the expenditure. </para></quote><para>I said:</para><motion><para>That is all reasonable as far as it goes. The point that, I guess, my questions lead to is: if you have, say, as a performance indicator `a more competitive cost structure', what is it more than? You must have a baseline or it is a meaningless performance indicator, is it not?</para></motion><para>Mr Roseby answered:</para><quote><para>At the initial stages we did not have a set of data which was basically set out as baseline data saying, `Here is a cost structure they are all working from.' </para></quote><para>Later I asked:</para><quote><para>There is the sugar industry program and the sugar industry assistance package, which I was referring to.</para></quote><para>And Dr Samson said:</para><quote><para>Correct. The sugar industry assistance package is the one that is administered through the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The sugar industry improvement program is the one that has a series of projects in Queensland, New South Wales and WA. </para></quote><para>Later he said:</para><quote><para>With the sugar industry improvement program, as you are aware, there is a number of projects. I think it is fair to say some of them have been slower to take off than anticipated. The thinking at the moment is we would be looking to evaluate the entire program probably in the 2001-02 year. </para></quote><para>Later that day I asked:</para><quote><para>If I asked you the same questionsâI think I have already asked these about the sugar industry improvement program and the sugar industry assistance package ... would the answer in relation to the baseline data that you would use to judge those achievements be the same as the answers you have already given me?</para></quote><para>The answer was, `Yes, Senator.' In other words, there is no baseline dataâno means of judging the performance of the measures that the government say that they are funding. The government have said, `We're giving you some money to do something. We have no idea what baseline we are working from. We are going to set these grandiose targets in our budgets for achievement, but you will have no way of measuring what we achieve. We do not really intend for you to be able to measure those achievements.'</para><para>I also pursued the fact that, while the conditions confronting this important industry continued to deteriorate, the government just plodded on. They did not review the programs they had in place. They did not say, `We are spending millions of dollars here, but the industry continues to slide so perhaps we should have another look at where and how this money is being used and whether there should be an increase in funding to help sugar growers.' There was a budget only a matter of weeks ago but, despite it being well known to everyone that the sugar industry is in crisis, nothing new emerged in that process. Based on the evidence to the estimates committee, the minister did not even try to get more assistance for the industry through the budget process, and that has been revealed again in the estimates <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. The department revealed that there was no work done on this industry in the lead-up to the budget, but now the industry is being asked to come up with a plan. There is no plan for this industry emanating from the government.</para><para>There has been no cooperative approach by this minister and his department with the sugar industry to deal with these problems. Like the dairy industry, the sugar growers have to come up with their own plan, and only then will the government start to look at the problems of the industry and see if there is a solution which is available to the government. If there is any need to confirm what the government knew and where the government was, one only needs to look at page 70 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 22 May 2000. Mr Roseby, a very senior officer of the department, said:</para><quote><para>...we know, with poor weather in combination with a very difficult period of low world prices. That is a problem which is emerging now. We know there is a problem in that area, and we have some idea of what the problem is.</para></quote><para>Some idea! This is after the budget. He continued:</para><quote><para>Governments generally encourage industry to take initiatives and come forward with proposals; that is now under way. We are aware that that industry is putting together a proposal for the government and we await that proposal. </para></quote><para>As Senator Forshaw said, there is nothing proactive about this minister or his party. It is hardly surprising that the National Party is becoming irrelevant in this country. There are four representatives of the National Party in this place, and three have their offices in the capital cities of their respective states and territories. I am not sure where Senator Sandy Macdonald will place his officeâto his credit, in the past he did have his office in regional Australia, and I expect that he will. One cannot say the same for Senator Boswell, Senator McGauran or Senator Tambling. Their offices are all in the capital citiesâSenator McGauran's is in Collins Street, Melbourne; Senator Boswell's is in Eagle Place, Brisbane; and Senator Tambling's is on the Esplanade, Darwin.</para><para>Senator Boswell had the nerve to criticise the Senate committee for going to rural and regional Australiaâfor taking the parliament to the bush so that they could have a say. Senator Boswell had the gall to criticise Senator Woodley for spending the taxpayers' moneyâfor taking the parliament to the people. I am proud that I was part of those exercises. They have done a lot of good. They have given a lot of people in rural and regional Australia the opportunity to see their senators. They certainly would not see their National Party senators if we did not take them there through the committee process, because three out of the four of them have their offices in the metropolitan areas of Australia. The National Party, the former Country PartyâI am glad they changed the name because the ACCC would have had to take them on for misleading and deceptive conductâpretend that they still have a connection with rural and regional Australia, but you only have to look where the offices of three out of four of their senators are to know that where they really want to be is the big city.

This bill is to give effect to the government's undertaking to retain responsibility for the payment of general assistance to local government and to maintain the level of such assistance in real, per capita terms. This is despite an attempt by the government in its initial package to abolish financial assistance grants to local government directly from the Commonwealth and to essentially hand over responsibility for providing that finance to the states. Labor successfully moved an amendment in the Senate ensuring that direct Commonwealth financial assistance for local governments would continue. This was the desired outcome for the local councils throughout Australia.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation also abolishes the link between financial assistance grants to local government and financial assistance grants to the states. The previous arrangement was that local government grants were directly connected to the financial assistance grants to the states. Given that financial assistance grants to the states will cease to occur as a result of the introduction of the GST, this arrangement can no longer function. Although I am pleased that we will continue to see local government receive direct payments from the federal government, it is concerning to say the least that this legislation does nothingâand I say that again: this legislation does nothingâto restore the $15 million that the government cut from federal assistance to local government in the 1997-98 period. There is also no provision made for any real growth in payments to be made to local governments. You only have to be out and about in local government to understand the full impact of that. It is unfortunate that this issue was not addressed in this legislation. It is unfortunate but not surprising, given the government's record on providing for local government.</para><para>Local government is one of the biggest service providers in this country, as we well know. Councils, together, spend over $10 billion each year providing a broad range of infrastructure, economic and community services. Local councils employ some 140,000 people. Despite this enormous contribution to our community, the federal government has failed to give councils the vital information they need about how they will be affected by the GST and about adequate compensation. Councils are still wondering if the information they have been given is conclusive or if it will change again prior to 1 July, depending on the government's whim.</para><para>On the wider issue of the government's treatment of local councils, the complete disregard for the strain the GST implementation is putting on local councils is reflective of their attitude towards local government generally. Since coming to office in 1996, the government have treated local councils with nothing short of contempt. Not only have they lumped local governments with a GST, they gave them six months of confusion and mayhem where local councils were left scratching their heads as to what was and what was not GST exempt and how the GST was to be implemented. The government failed to give councils the vital information they needed about how they would be affected by the GST. The former President of the Local Government Association of Queensland, Tom Pyne, spoke for most local councils earlier this year when he made the following comment: </para><quote><para>How is local government to deal with the GST if the federal government is still working things out?...The delays have meant councils' decision-making processes have been halted. This means councils are unable to put in place future pricing strategies, begin the budget process, or implement the software a new system requires. The federal government runs a very real risk that the GST will collapse even before it starts.</para></quote><para>Finally, at the end of January 2000, the government released a draft determination of exempt taxes, fees and charges. This draft lists those taxes, fees and charges levied by state and local governments that are to be GST exempt. All council services not listed in the draft are subject to the GST, as I understand it. This has left councils with something in the order of only four months to finalise their planning and procedures to ensure they will be GST compliant by 1 July 2000. Not only were councils given very little time to plan for the introduction of the GST, they now face exorbitant costs for the implementation process. The Local Government Association of Queenslandâthe LGAQâhas estimated a total state bill in the order of $7 million to implement the GST. However, in response, the federal government has agreed to allocate only $535,000 to Queensland councils for the GST implementation assistance.</para><para>The shortfall between the government's funding for implementation costs and estimated costs by the LGAQ is significant and concerning to say the least. The government knew a long time ago about the level of complexity and the strains that would be placed on local government with the increasing burden of the GST. Yet they still chose to waste $410 million on the <inline font-style="italic">Unchain My Heart </inline>propaganda campaign rather than adequately compensate local councils for their implementation costs. The $410 million would have gone a long way towards compensating local councils for the increased costs of GST complianceâthe software, staff training and costs involved with GST implementation. Local councils do not need emotive, politically biased, wasteful propaganda campaigns. They need genuine compensation that will cover their costs in complying with this complex, confusing tax.</para><para>Rural Queensland councils in particular are going to feel the brunt of this government's broken promise on the reduction in fuel costs. The government's election promise that the costs of petrol would not rise under the GST has already been thrown into doubt, with the Treasurer admitting that this promise has limits. This is despite the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, indicating that councils would benefit from a reduction in fuel costs and the removal of wholesale sales tax. This government went to the last election promising that petrol would not increase under the GST, as the government would reduce the excise on petrol by the amount equivalent to a 10 per cent increase. However, this was based, as I understand it, on a 77c per litre price. Since then, petrol prices in some cities have threatened to reach the $1 a litre mark and have been higher in many rural areas. The government now concedes that there are limits to its election promise and has said that in many areas it will be unable to ensure that petrol prices do not increase with the introduction of the GST. Yet again, the areas that will be primarily affected are rural and regional areas. </para><para>The government has since considered a regionally based fuel rebate, in an acknowledgment that in the current environment it cannot deliver on its promise. Local councils were right to be suspicious of this government's promise that councils would benefit from the implementation of the GST. The Australian Local Government Association's comments to the Senate inquiry last year in relation to the introduction of the GST paint a picture of exactly what local councils think of the GST. It is a long quote but I think it summarises quite well the position that local councils find themselves in. They said:</para><quote><para>The primary concern of Local Government is that aspects of the Government's tax reform proposals will impact negatively the provision of adequate and equitable services to local communities throughout Australiaâ</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name></talker><para>âI will take that interjection, Senator McGauran.

The government claims that councils will benefit from substantial cost reductions following the introduction of the GST. However, no concrete studies have been undertaken by the government to substantiate this claim. The quantum of any perceived savings is unclear and would obviously vary considerably, particularly depending on the size and location of the council in question. </para><para>The amount of GST compensation given to Queensland councils is hopelessly inadequate, given the cost and complexity of the GST implementation program. As a Queensland Labor senator, I am extremely concerned about the burden that GST implementation is placing on councils throughout Queensland, and I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the enormous costs some Queensland councils are having to endure prior to the start of the GST. And it is not only the larger councils in the urban areas. There are a couple of examples that I wish to mention. The Brisbane City Council, being the largest municipality in Australia, is facing an extraordinary burden with the GST. The Brisbane City Council will be facing a billâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name></talker><para>âHave you asked about yours in your local council? The Brisbane City Council will be facing a bill of $25 million in the first year and $15 million every year thereafter. This includes an initial $10 million in set-up costs and $200,000 annually to maintain those systems. It is expected that the council's own GST bill will come to $14.8 million per annum. The number of staff that the council has employed to look at the impact and implementation of the GST has risen to 35, as I understand it. This is an enormous outlay, for which this federal government has provided very little compensation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Similarly, the Gold Coast City Council has a GST implementation budget of $2.1 million and has devoted 23 full-time staff to the task of putting in place the appropriate GST systems and procedures, as I understand it. The council has chosen to raise the cost of services which are subject to a GST rather than incorporate the GST into a general rates increase. Unfortunately, those valuable services provided by the Gold Coast City Council will have to cost more now to avoid losing the services altogether. This situation is faced by all local councils as they worry about unknown factors eating into their bottom lines, including compliance costs involved in administering the new tax system and a potential decrease in community support for local councils and their services in the face of increased charges with the 10 per cent GST.</para><para>The Diamantina Shire Council has only eight full-time staffâit is a small councilâdealing with the administration of the council as a whole. Due to cost restraints, the mammoth task of administering the GST will have to be done internally, among the already overworked staff. Although a lot of rural councils do not have a specific budget for GST implementation, they are extremely concerned about the effect of the GST on other budget line items. For example, the Tambo Shire Council is expecting its budget for office maintenance, which is currently about $26,000, to increase by $5,000 for GST related software alone. This is about a 20 per cent increase for this line item. Again, the increased burden on council services of administering the GST will be worn by the existing council administration employees. </para><para>These compliance problems are just the start of the pain which local councils are going to have to endure from 1 July 2000. Councils will have to include a 10 per cent GST in the price of council services. Many of these services are community services that are not provided, or not likely to be provided, by private operators. Councils are therefore left with the dilemma of whether to increase these fees and charges by 10 per centâand risk making them unavailable to those who most need themâor to absorb this cost by increasing rates. We do not hear you now, Senator McGauran. This is despite the coalition's promise during the 1998 election campaign that non-commercial activities of councils for which a nominal charge is applied would not be subject to the GST. This was in line with the community service, non-profit nature of these activities, which has seen the bulk of charitable organisations also exempted from the GST. It then became clear that the government would define all activities of local government for which a nominal fee is charged as commercial, even though these activities are community service obligations. The result of this government's habit of making and breaking promises is a confused and suspicious situation and makes the local government sector worry even more.</para><para>Councils provide many local community services at low cost and often in situations where the services would not otherwise be provided by a private operator. These services can be provided at low cost because they are subsidised by rates. In many remote areas, the swimming pool is often run by the council as a non-profit activity, as well as other services such as library services, sporting and recreational facilities and essential community services for the elderly. It is extraordinary that the government would define all activities of local government for which a nominal fee or charge is levied as commercial, even though these activities are often community service obligations heavily subsidised by rates and not attractive to the private sector. A GST on these services is unfair and inequitable and is further proof that the GST will hit hardest those who are least able to afford it. A further headache for local councils is the unfair distinction being made between activities which have been contracted out and those which councils still undertake themselves. Some local councils have chosen to contract out activities, including some regulatory activities such as building inspections. Under the government's determination of GST exemptions, activities provided by the private sector will attract the GST. However, the same activities provided directly by the council will not be subject to the GST.</para><para>Rural councils are going to suffer the most under this GST. Again, this is not surprising given this government's pitiful record on providing assistance to rural and regional Australia. The National Party and, in particular, the National Party senator from Queensland should be ashamed of their record on regional, rural and remote Australia. The Nationals are now indistinguishable from the Liberals. Federal National MPs have supported every anti-farmer, anti-country town and anti-regional development measure introduced by their citycentric coalition partners. The big end of town Liberals have won out again. The federal Nationals have voted to sell off Telstra, voted for the GST, stood silently while their government withdrew services and jobs from country towns, allowed vital infrastructure to run down, cut funding for roads, tried to con farmers that the impact of the GST would be offset by a reduction in transport costs, and slashed over $200 million from the popular AAA package and tried to dress the fact up as a funding increase. They cut $3.9 million from Landcare and supported the deregulation of Australia Post. In recent state and federal elections, country communities have turned to Labor in increasing numbers. They demand parliamentary representatives who listen and respond to their everyday concerns in practical ways. Labor has a proud tradition of standing up for rural concerns and working well with rural councils to improve the services available to their constituencies.</para><para>The government needs to do some serious rethinking on its approach to rural and regional Australia. What is needed are some effective targeted programs that the government is committed to and a genuine attempt to provide assistance to rural councils in a way that will actually produce results. In the rural and regional areas which this government has ignored over the past four years, as usual it has been the local councils which have provided the community services necessary for these towns to survive. Yet it is these very community services which are now going to be slugged with a GST. It is clear that local governments will be struggling to meet the requirements of the GST in terms of both implementation costs and subsequent costs, threatening community services. Local government is too important to be left to struggle to survive. This level of government is closest to the community and has an important and integral role to play in the delivery of services to local communities and in allocating priorities in the delivery of those services. The federal government should clearly recognise this and provide adequate resources to ensure that local councils can properly fulfil their role in council and local community development.  </para><para>It is worth mentioning two other matters that come to mind.

I thank those senators who have made a sensible contribution to this debate. In particular, I note Senator Greig's contributionâparts of which, with respect, were difficult to follow. But certainly in some other parts Senator Greig was right on. He is, of course, a former member of a local government council. He said that as he travelled around councils he found that they had no major concerns. No major concerns have been raised about the GST or its impact on councils. He is only agreeing with the Labor Treasurer for New South Wales, who has said it is good news for councils. So we have agreement across the boardâthe ACCC, the Labor Treasurer for New South Wales, Senator Greig and the councils that Senator Greig has gone out to see. I do not want to dwell on the Democrats approach to this, but I could say to you, Senator Mackay, `Please go out and talk rationally with councils. Don't try to raise political points and to play petty politics. Go out and talk to them and you will find, as Senator Greig has done, that, while some of them have some problems with implementation, by and large they understand the benefits.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the first part of her contribution, Senator Mackay set out what the bill before us is about. Its purpose is outlined in the second reading speech, which I have tabled, and I will not repeat it. Suffice it to say that the amendment allows for local government financial assistance grants to be maintained on a real per capita basis as we have promised. It also contains provisions for the unlikely event that councils for some constitutional reason say that they do not have to pay the GST. In that event, if they happen to be right, the relevant state or territory would be required to retain the same amount from their grantsâthe impact of that being that even if councils are inclined to do it, they will not. But I know most councils around Australiaâthey are run by responsible people, and I am sure that they will abide by the law.</para><para>I regret that I was not able to sit through the whole of the contributions on this debate. However, some points were made that require a response. I am not going to respond to those speakers who made the vicious, personal attacks on me that have become typical of some of the Labor Party senators. I am a big boy; I can take it. But they always do this when I am not here. In question time, when they have an Australia-wide audience, not once do I get a question from anybody on the Labor side. We would welcome some contribution to the debate. Perhaps Senator Mackay lacks the confidence to do itâI am not sure what it is. But not since 19 October last century did Labor ask a question on rural and regional Australia or on local government. That shows the Labor Party's involvement and interest in this issue. </para><para>Some comment was made about the cutback of some funds by this government when it came into power. The reason for that, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well know, is that Mr Beazley, as finance minister, left us a $10.8 billion black hole, which had to be met. As a result of his black hole and his government's mismanagement of the economy, councils were paying huge amounts of interest on loans. I was on a council immediately before I came into this place, and we were paying about 14 or 15 per cent on our loans because the national economy was in such a rotten state because of Mr Beazley's leadership. As a result of our government's good management of the economy, those same councils are now paying about six or seven per cent. In many public speeches, I have been through the real savings to councils that that representsâof far more value than a cutback to meet Mr Beazley's black hole. Our financial management has meant that councils pay less, and it has more than compensated for the cutback we had to make to get councilsâas we did with state governmentsâto contribute to Mr Beazley's black hole.</para><para>Senator Mackay also spoke about the ANTS package generally, which has real savings for councils. Again, I quote not only Senator Greig, not only the Labor Treasurer of New South Wales, not only the ACCC, not only the Victorian government's Arthur Andersen report into Victorian councils, but councils right across the nation, who recognise that the ANTS package is really good news for local government. Admittedly, there are some start-up costs, but they are more than overcome by the annual savings that councils will make.</para><para>Senator Mackay made some mention of regional AustraliaâI think she was saying that I never went there. I will give you my itinerary, Senator Mackay; I very rarely get home. In fact, I do not think even my cat recognises me now, because I am always out going around rural and regional Australia and talking to rural and regional Australians. Neither Senator Mackay nor Mr Ferguson can help it if they live in a capital city.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âI live in Tasmania, you idiot!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âI thought you lived in Hobart.

This is a good game we can play: `We've got this many and you've got that many.' If only you had confined it! Senator Mackay, on our side in the Senate we have my colleague Senator Calvert, a very distinguished wardenâand for those of you who are not from Tasmania, that means mayorâof the Clarence Municipal Council for many years, from 1976 to 1988. He was on the council and was warden from 1983 to 1987. His record is very distinguished, and if I ever need any advice on local government Senator Calvert is always willing to give it, because he knows what it is all about. Senator Eggleston was mayor of the town of Port Hedland for three years, from 1993 to 1996, and was on the council from 1988 to 1996. My colleague Senator Heffernan was president of the Junee council during the periods 1989-90 and 1991-93 and was on the council for some 15 years. I have been on the Burdekin Shire Council for 13 years. Senator McGauran was on a council for three years, and Senator Tambling was on a council for a number of years. </para><para>I give credit where credit is due. There are some Labor senators who have been on councils. Senator McLucas was on the Cairns City Council for four years and that great expert on rural and regional matters, Senator Conroy, was on the Footscray City Council for some period of time. Senator Greig, as I mentioned, has been on a council and Senator Allison from the Democrats was on the Port Melbourne Council for a couple of years in the early 1990s. Not much turns on that, but on this side of the Senate there are people who understand local government. That is why the package is so good for local governmentâbecause people on this side of the chamber made a contribution to the development of the tax package.</para><para>I heard Senator Mackay say something that is going to go down well in regional Australia.

We look forward to that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Crossin raised the interesting issue of horizontal fiscal equalisationâquite a sensible approach. It is a difficult issue. For those of you who are not familiar with it, when the Commonwealth give out the $1.25 billion grants to local government each year, we give them out principally on the basisâif I can put this simply and not technicallyâof making sure that Australians, no matter where they live, get roughly equitable access to standard municipal services. That is what the financial assistance grants are all about. We proceed under an act of the former government that provides that. As I recall, when it came to the Senate as a bill the coalition supported it. It provides that that $1.25 billion annually goes to the states on a per capita basis. Obviously New South Wales and Victoria get much more than the other states because of the per capita distribution. Once it gets to the state level, it is then distributed from the state base on a horizontal fiscal equalisation basis. That is trying to give a fair share to some of those councils that have lesser rating capacity or greater needs. </para><para>In bringing forward a review of the financial assistance grants and getting the Commonwealth Grants Commission to conduct that review for me, I did approach local government associations across Australia and the various state governments as well. I indicated that the government had decided that it was not appropriate in this review to look at the question of the interstate distributions on a per capita basis. I got responses from a number of states. I suspect it is not appropriate for me to say what ministers say to me in private correspondence. Suffice it to say, Senator Mackay, that you would be surprised at which states actually said, `No, we don't want you to look at that.' I will give you a little tip, though: they were Labor states. I will not say a couple, a few or many because that might give it away, but there were Labor states which said, `Yes, you shouldn't look at that.' Senator Mackay, you might be interested in doing a bit of research on that before you say too much about it, and perhaps you should counsel Senator Crossin.  </para><para>I suppose Senator Crossin could easily say, `I wasn't in the parliament back in 1992 when the Labor government looked at this issue,' but I understand that Mr Snowdon in the other place made a big point about this. I think he said he was going to make it his life's work to make sure this happened. Mr Snowdon had 13 years. He was out for three but he had a lot of years when Labor was in power and did not do anything about it; not a thing about it did Mr Snowdon do. It is easy to stand up and talk but, when you were there and had the opportunity to do it, what was the action? Absolutely nothing. I do not think you were here, Senator Mackay, but I was when the Grants Commission came out and said they had looked at this and they thought it should be distributed interstate on an equalisation basis, but there was no data so they recommended against it. I would not say this, of course, but one wonders what the attitude of the government of the day and the relevant ministers might have been. I think the minister at the time was a Victorian, and one wonders what his view on it might have been. So the Labor Party had every opportunity to do it and did absolutely nothing. Senator Mackay, you might counsel Senator Crossin on just what she is going to do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âSo what are you doing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âSenator, if you have not seen the terms of review I will make them available to you, but I think I have sent them out to everyone who might be interested in them, and I am sure you would have got a copy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There were a number of anecdotal questions raised.

I understand the other parties have agreed with the base approach of the act to make sure that councils continue to receive their $1Â¼ billion in grants from the Commonwealth government. I thank the Labor Party and the Democrats for their support for the bill. I notice that Senator Mackay is moving an amendment to the second reading motion, expressing concern that financial assistance grants to local government have been cut in real terms. I have explained that, but I emphasise that what local government have gained out of the government's financial management is much lower interest rates. That will mean substantial dollars to them. We are criticised for attempting to terminate local government funding. That is an issue of a past time. I agree with it. At the last election, our approach was that the states would get their GST money only if they agreed to pay to the local governments what we were paying to them. So we protected and guaranteed local government in putting that onto the states. Unfortunately, we were not able to get that through, but that is all history now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

What he did not do, as usual, is respond to the issue of how the GST impacts on local government, which he never does in estimates either. There is a reason for this, and that is that he and his department have indicated quite blatantly that there has been no study done in relation to the GST and local government. In fact, this minister has no intention of conducting a survey on the GST and local government. But he feels very well qualified to come into the chamber and to make comments when there is a local government election on. He has become a bit of a savant in the GST area in relation to two councils in particular. There was the Brisbane City Council, in relation to which he got the dorothy on the GST. He seemed extraordinarily well versed in the GST for somebody who in estimates said he did not know anything about how it was going to impact on local government. Then there was the South Sydney Council, on which he got another dorothy from his side. Guess what is going on there? An election. </para></talk.start><para>This minister, as always, is still acting like he is in opposition. He has never answered the question about the impact of the GST on local government; but when there is an election on and the Labor Party is running particularly well, all of a sudden he seems to know an awful lot more about it than he does in estimates. It is appalling. I have been out to a number of councils very extensively, particularly to National Party councils. The warmest reception that Labor is getting at the moment, other than from its own councils, and perhaps even warmer than from its own councils, is from the National Party councils. They are absolutely appalled about what this government has done. If the minister is so well versed in relation to the GST and local government, we will ask him yet again, for the hundredth time, a question which he refused to answer in estimates. It is no wonder that the opposition choose not to bother with this minister in question time, because in estimates he indicates that he has no idea. In estimates he said he had no idea how the GST would impact on local government, nor does he have any intention of finding out. </para><para>More seriously, he has said in estimates that he has no idea how the GST is going to impact on regional Australia and moreover he has no intention of finding out. Every time we have asked a question in relation to GST, this minister has directed us to Treasury. But he is very well versed when there is an election on. This minister has started to use this chamber for political exercises in terms of local council elections, something that in my time as shadow minister I have never, ever done. All of a sudden, there is an election on and Senator Macdonald is there. I think Senator Macdonald thinks that this is all a bit of sport, that this is all a bit of fun. It is not. We in the Labor Party believe in local government. I went through a number of the initiatives that we had achieved which have been abolished. There was the Local Government Development Program and the cuts to the financial assistance grants which Senator Macdonald indicated were part of a so-called Beazley black hole. Well, Senator Macdonald, that was four years ago and that money still has not gone back in.</para><para>In relation to the impact of GST and local government, I wonder whether Senator Macdonald is aware of comments from his own council, the Burdekin Shire Council, which he proudly indicated to us he was on for 11 yearsâand I do not think particularly missed. That is up to them to say, but in fact that is what they say. I will quote the minister's own council, from the Ayr/Home Hill<inline font-style="italic"> Observer</inline> of Thursday, 1 June. This is one of the councils he says is welcoming the GST. This is one of the councils he says is not going to be impacted by the GST. This council was actually considering increasing rates by 20 per cent as a result of the GST. Councillor Llew Davies is quoted as saying he thought councillors could not justify heavy increases. The article continues:</para><quote><para>âEveryone hates the GST already and for us to double that impact is not going to make us any more popular,â he said.</para></quote><para>He then went on to talk about the implications in relation to Burdekin Shire. Burdekin Shire is not the only council. As I said, it is not just the Labor councils in relation to this. A number of councils have indicated it. My colleagues have amply explained the GST legislation and how it is going to impact on local government.</para><para>Yesterday the minister misused parliament again for a local government election. He did not misuse taxpayers' money this time. He has already done that: he sent out a major direct mail letter during the Brisbane council election to tout for his candidate in the Brisbane council. Yesterday he misused parliament to dump on a council which expressed concern with the GST. Today we discover that the ACCC is now investigating this council. That is very interesting. Perhaps the minister, who is supposedly so well versed in the GST, could answer this question: does the ACCC have jurisdiction over councils? I would be interested to know the answer to that. While he is at it, he could perhaps explain this to me from the government perspectiveâhe is not the ACCC; he is just the minister. Can local government expect to be investigated by the ACCC every time there is a local council election on; or every time the minister gets a dorothy dixer in the Senate and slags off at people who are running for local government; or, probably less politically, every time they are forced to increase rates, which I have to say is widespread; or every time they have to increase charges as a result of the GST? Will they expect the ACCC on their backs then, and do the ACCC in fact have jurisdiction? </para><para>Most of the people here and local government, I know, would appreciate some answers on the GST and local government. This minister and this government have provided none. This minister could not even answer where the figure of $70 million came from. He says local government will be $70 million better off. We ask: how? His response is, `Dunno. Go and ask Treasury.' We ask: where will that money go? His response is, `to local government'. Well, of course it will not. It will go to the states. We ask: will it be disbursed to local government? His response is, `Dunno. Go and ask Treasury in relation to that.' We ask: well, what is the impact of GST on local government? His response is, `Dunno. Go and ask Treasury,' or, more usually, as Senator Forshaw pointed out, `I refuse to answer that question.' We had that for a while: `I refuse to answer that question.' The biggest dummy spit, in terms of estimates, was the day after the Democrat deal when this minister realised that he was going to remain the minister for local government. Those estimates were an absolute beauty. He would not answer one question in relation to GST. It was the day after the Democrats had done the deal and he realised that for the remainder of his time as minister he was going to have to deal with local government. We did not get one single response.</para><para>We have a number of issues we wish to raise and of course this will be a fairly lengthy committee stage. I do not want to hog the limelight. I know that my colleagues here, Senator Forshaw and Senator O'Brien, and others have issues they wish to raise in relation to this. We do not often get the opportunity to talk to this minister directly in committee stage and I indicate to the chamber we will be making full use of it. Suffice to say that I have raised a couple of issues. Perhaps the minister could break his duck and have a crack at answering them, and we will be able to pass that information on to local government. Let us not be too thin-skinned about it, Senator Macdonald. You have a reputation of being one of the most offensive senators in the Senate in terms of dishing it out but you seem to be incapable of taking it. In your contribution, you used the opportunity to malign somebody in local government yet again. Yet again, misuse of parliamentary privilege.

Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, the minister is quite happy to sit there and snipe in relation to contributions that are made, but will he get to his feet? Apparently not. This minister has persistently said that we do not ask him questions. He wants them asked in question time. One can see why one would not bother asking this minister questions in question timeâhe does not answer them. We have given the minister an opportunity to stand up hereâand he is not limited to four minutes; he gets 15 minutesâand answer a number of questions. He gets repeated opportunities to stand up here and answer questions. I thought this was his portfolio area. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Apparently, the minister really does not want us to ask him questions because when we do, he will not answer them. When they are asked in estimates he will not answer them. Noâthat is not quite true. He has intervened in the estimates process a couple of times when I have been asking questions. It has been interesting to watch the body language of the officers of the department when he raises those answers. I have seen some blushes in my time and some eyes going to the sky, but it would be very interesting to review the tape to see if it picks up the body language and the actions of the officers at the table when the minister intervenes. </para><para>Maybe that is why the minister does not answer questionsâbecause he does not feel that he is competent to answer the questions. He has got the message that it is better that he keeps his mouth shut and does not put his foot in it. He has been pretty good at doing that. So I would be very interested to hear a contribution from this minister, the minister who has been begging us for questions, who is complaining that we have not asked him questions. </para><para>I said before in this place, in another debate, at the committee stage of the appropriations bill: why would we bother asking this minister questions when he does not answer them? Today the minister is here. He can stand up and tell us why we should ask him questions. He can answer the questions that are before him. The people of Australia who are listening to this broadcast can make the judgment that this minister is pretty good at standing up and taking a dorothy dix question and he is pretty good at standing up where he is limited to four minutes and can avoid the question but, when he is in the committee stage and he actually has 15 minutes to answer a question, when he has repeated opportunities to make his case, he chooses not to do so. I think the people of Australia, the people of his own state, would be rather ashamed to find that the minister is dodging an opportunity to put his case. </para><para>He is quite happy to have a go at the Labor council in the City of Brisbaneâto no avail. I suspect his attempt to attack the South Sydney Council today will be another failure. The minister has a chequered past as opposition spokesman. He was keen to make statements but they were not really the sorts of statements that his leader wanted tested. As I understand it, Mr Hewson decided that he did not want Senator Macdonald as his spokesperson some time ago. But he has made his way back to the ministry. He has a chance to prove himself. He has 15 minutes on a number of occasions. I am sure we will give him the opportunity to stand up and answer some questions, to give us some of the gems that he is capable of or, alternatively, the people of Australia can make the judgment that when this minister asks for questions he is not serious, he does not really want to answer questions. All he wants to do is to play the political game and have a go at people who cannot stand up and respond when he makes the sorts of outrageous statements he has been making. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14865</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not going to enter into this debate.

As he has acknowledged himself, he has never bothered to find out. He has not directed his department to find out. He has not directed his department to ascertain the impact of the GST on local government and, certainly, I would put to you, he has not directed his department to test the impact of this particular legislation on local government. That came out of his own mouth at estimates when he saidâand I quoted this earlierâ`We haven't done the analysis and we don't intend to.' With respect to the impact of the GST, particularly the up-front costs of the GST, he relies on a report that was produced many months ago by Arthur Andersenâa report which was produced, I believe, for the previous Victorian government and which precedes the advice given by the government to local government in January and then subsequently in March this year on the impact of the GST on taxes, charges and fees, particularly as they relate to local government.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>So he has relied upon outdated information that was produced by a consulting company, not at this government's request but at the request of the Victorian governmentâearly last year, I think, but I stand to be corrected. It was certainly well before this legislation was introduced into the parliament and well before the government started to answer some of the questions that were directed to them by local government. Their answer to local government has been, `This minister can't tell you. You should talk to either the tax office or Treasury'âeven though he is the minister for local governmentâ`or you should go away and read the Arthur Andersen report.' Is it any wonder that local government are not even wasting their time these days with this minister? They do not have time to waste. The GST is just around the corner. It is going to come in in a matter of weeks. </para><para>As members of this Senate, we have an obligation and a responsibility to take up with this minister the issues that local government have raised with us, and we are quite happy to do that. For instance, with respect to the costs that they will have to face with the implementation of the GST, they have raised with us the question of whether there will be any further assistance made available to local government if it is found that the implementation costs of the GST are well beyond what this minister claims they should be. Minister Macdonald said at estimatesâon one of the few occasions when he did give an answer, but again I think he was relying on that Arthur Andersen reportâthat the average cost to local government for the implementation of the GST would be around $6,000. He did concede that for a large council, such as the Brisbane City Council, it might be $200,000, but he said, `That is an infinitesimal sort of amount for a big city council like Brisbane.' </para><para>We have spoken to councils in northern New South Wales as recently as a couple of weeks agoâand these are not Labor Party councils; these are councils which are made up of Independents and, in many cases, National Party people. They have indicated to us that they believe the costs are well beyond that figure of $6,000. Indeed, one major council on the North Coastâthe Coffs Harbour City Councilâhas had to employ additional staff for many months just to deal with the implementation of the GST. Further, they have had to get advice from accountancy firms and consultants to supplement the work that their additional staff as well as the existing staff have had to do. So the costs are well in excess of $6,000. </para><para>They cannot put their rates up: firstly, because of rate pegging and, secondly, because of the difficulties of being a rural or regional council where there is high unemployment and where business is suffering. Despite the claims about the substantial benefits in the economy under this government, these councils are suffering. They are being called upon to provide more and more services. They are not in a position to simply put their rates up to cover not only the additional implementation costs but also the other costs on non-commercial activities that they will have to meet as a result of the GST. I ask the minister: is your department prepared and are you prepared to have undertaken an analysis of the actual costs that councils will face with respect to the GST? If it is found to be well in excess of that $6,000 average that you quote, will you do something about assisting those councils? You are quite happy to get up here and attack the man rather than play the ball. You have attacked Lord Mayor Vic Smith and his South Sydney Council and challenged their assertions about the GST. Why don't you back that up by getting your department to undertake an analysis? It could then be provided to the parliament and to the committee and we could test your assertions. So my question is: will you do that? </para><para>There are some gems in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 25 May, and it will provide plenty of material for a long time to come in respect of the approach adopted by Minister Macdonald. In answer to one question, Minister Macdonald admitted that he had really confused himself, and he had to take on notice the issue of compensation for councils which related to population growth. I will come back to that. There are so many gems in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that we could quote them ad nauseam. The best one was today, when Minister Macdonald said that his department had not done any assessments, nor did they intend doing them.

Given that Mr Costello trumpets the fiscal policies of the government, will that money be put back in? Four: does the ACCC have jurisdiction over local government in relation to policing it on improper rate rises or what it regards as improper rate rises or improper fee increases? Fiveâand this is a new one: will the minister explain why the local government incentive program was underspent by $1 million this yearâa program which, in his own department's words, and in the guidelines, was expressly there to assist with GST implementation?

He tries to have it both ways. He says, `You can't ask these questions in estimates. You should deal with them in the chamber; that is the proper place when we are debating legislation.' When we are debating legislation that is an amendment to the law that actually provides for the financial assistance to local governments from the federal government, that is obviously the appropriate place to deal with issues that relate to financial assistance to local government by the federal government. So we come in here to debate this bill and ask these questions that are very pertinent to this legislation and to the broader issuesâthat is, the impact of the GST upon local governmentâand the minister sits there with his head down and ignores the questions. I want to come back to one of the issues that is particularly relevant to the future of local government funding and financial assistance grants. I will quote from the estimates hearings where this issue was also raised. On page 439 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, Senator Macdonald made a statement. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Yes. In 1997-98 the local government grants were increased for inflation but not population growth as part of the government-wide contribution to address the deficit that the government inherited in 1996. The quantum was not increased by real per capita growth; it was however increased in real terms. However, the effect of the CPI meant that the dollar term declined. However, I emphasise that the reduction in the dollar amount was because of the movement in that year's CPI. </para></quote><para>He then said this:</para><quote><para>If you know what that means, good luck to you.</para></quote><para>I asked Senator Macdonald:</para><quote><para>Do you want to take that on notice?</para></quote><para>He said:</para><quote><para>No. I have given my answer; you interpret it as you will. They were increased for inflation but not for population growth, which is what I thought and what I said. They were increased in real terms but not in real per capita terms, because the per capita bit did not come. I think the clearest way of saying that is that they were increased for inflation but not for the population increase. </para></quote><para>Then there was a further discussion between Senator Mackay and Senator Macdonald. Senator Macdonald then said:</para><quote><para>The CPI increase was overestimated, so it was retrospectively cut back. I am extrapolating that perhaps it was because the population increase had been allowed for but did not eventuate. That last bit I am not sure of.</para></quote><para>Senator Mackay said:</para><quote><para>I do not know that that isâ</para></quote><para>Before she could finish, Senator Macdonald said:</para><quote><para>Can I take that on notice and give it to you?</para></quote><para>Senator Mackay said, `Yes.' Then Senator Macdonald saidâand this was the quote that I was searching for a moment ago:</para><quote><para>I thought I understood it very easily and clearly, but I have now succeeded in confusing myself.</para></quote><para>I said to him:</para><quote><para>If you could tell us what you are taking on notice, we will agree with you.</para></quote><para>That is, we would agree that he should take it on notice. Senator Mackay then said:</para><quote><para>I have got a particular understanding that I would like clarified. So if you do take it on notice, we will all be happier.</para></quote><para>Senator Macdonald replied:</para><quote><para>We will take it on notice.</para></quote><para>Minister, if you recall that exchange, I trust that the confusion you brought upon yourself after saying that you clearly understood the issue and tried to explain it has now abated. If your confusion has now abated, could you please provide the committee with the answer to the question asked at estimatesâwhich is relevant to this legislation.

I again desist from making a comment on the point of order, which obviously demonstrates a lack of understanding, yet again, of the standing orders. None of the questions any of the senators have asked me in this debate so far have been, in any wayâby even the broadest stretch of the imaginationârelated to the provisions of this bill. Do I have to read them again? They are specifically on the escalation clause that will apply to federal government funding of local government, and there is a specific reference to a population element. Before, the minister and the statistician had to agree, but the statistician did not like that approach so we have amended that, as set out in the amending legislation. It relates to clause 17 of the amending bill, which states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>a condition that, if the payment is one from which, according to an agreement between Commonwealth and State, the State is to withhold an amount that represents voluntary GST payments that should have, but have not, been paid by the local governing bodiesâthe State will withhold the amount and pay it to the Commonwealth; </para></quote><para>So it is very specific. It is not about whether you like the GST or you do not, or whether the Labor Party has signed on to the GSTâas we all know, they haveâor whether they would roll it back or roll Mr Beazley out. It is not about those issues. They are good debating points, good fun, but not relevant to this bill. If there are relevant questions to be asked, with the help of my advisers I will answer them.

He just referred to the bill. He was clearly quoting from the bill and paraphrasing as well, and he referred to the fact that the bill deals with methods of calculation of funds for future local government assistance from the federal government, including changes that relate to how population increase could impact on the amount. I have just asked a question that was asked in estimates and that this minister took on noticeâbecause he did not really understand even his own answer at the time. He thought he didâhe had a stab at it, he had couple of goes at it, both before and after the dinner adjournment that day. Then he said in the end that he would take it on notice. He has just acknowledged that that is an issue that this bill clearly touches upon, and then he says he is not going to answer it because he does not think it is relevant. This is just doublespeak. They are totally contradictory comments from the minister within his own response. I would like an answer to the question that I asked, which was previously asked at estimates and which this minister agreed to take on notice and come back and clarify.</para></talk.start><para>I remind the minister that what we are dealing with here is a bill which amends the head legislation. The head legislation deals with financial assistance grants to local government, and that system is changing because of the GST. And further, there is now going to be ministerial discretion in respect of aspects of the way in which those grants are calculated and paid. So we are entitled to ask in this chamber about the impact of all of this upon local government funding in the future. The minister should answer the questions and not say they are not relevant. If this minister keeps saying that he is never obliged to answer a question because nothing is ever relevant, then I repeat what I said during the estimates hearing: you have to wonder what this minister's job really is. You ask him questions about regional services and he says it is not his area of responsibility.

The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 contains in subsection 8(1) the requirement that, in making his decision `whether to increase or to decrease a sum', the Treasurer is required to have regard to a number of the matters referred to in that subsection. Perhaps unwittingly, you did refer to that and, I think, asked a question. What that previous act required was that the Treasurer had to have regard to `underlying movements in general purpose Commonwealth payments to the States'. If I can just interpose there, that has been deleted, of course, because we no longer make payments to the states. He then, in subparagraph (b), had to have regard to `changes to the classification' of any Commonwealth payments to the statesâagain no longer relevant. In subparagraph (c) he had to have regard to `changes to the distribution of financial responsibilities as between the Commonwealth and the States'âno longer relevantâand in (d) he had to have regard to `any other matters that the Treasurer thinks relevant'. That provision has been retained although in a slightly more restricted form, giving the Treasurer less open discretion. So, Senator, that is the answer to your question on the bill. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14872</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would have to say at this stage in proceedings, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the government has an agreement from the opposition that we will deal with the Fuel Sales Grant Bill 2000 and associated measuresâNo. 5 on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.

I am only urging the minister to reconsider what he appears to have adopted as a policyâthat he will decide which relevant questions he will answerâbecause following that policy will only extend this debate unnecessarily. If he follows that policy, it is a matter which I suspect the government will have to act upon, because I understand it wants the Fuel Sales Grant Bill and associated bills tomorrow and so, if this legislation is proceeding, they would have to pull it to get that on.

If you have a question on the bill before the chamber, I will answer it. But coming in and trying to force me to enter into matters that have nothing to do with the billâin the typical union bullyboy wayâwill not pay dividends. I would certainly hope that, if there were any attempt to pull this bill, we would have the Democratsâand I see Senator Greig hereâand Senator Harradine, who has been watching this farce, supporting us in getting through this chamber a bill that everybody agrees with and that there are absolutely no questions on, apart from a vague one of Senator Forshaw's about the bill. There is not one question about the bill except that vague indirect one from Senator Forshaw which I have answered. Then people will see the farce that this is. We want this bill through, it has been agreed to by the Labor Party, it has been agreed to by the Democrats and you are not asking questions on the bill. So why don't we proceed to complete the committee stage and get the third reading through so that we can pay the moneys to local government. We can then deal with the next bill, which I am not familiar with but which is obviously an important billâI assume by arrangement it is a bill that all parties are going to supportâand we can get on with doing what we are paid to be doing; that is, getting legislation through this house and debating legislation, not using these processes of the Senate to embark upon personal attacks on various senators and to play the man rather than the ball. We are here to talk about the issues in the bill before us. I would certainly hope that the Temporary Chairman would direct the chamber to the bill before us and I would certainly hope that the other senators in the chamber would support that.

That is true. Might I say that that is a sentiment which has been echoed by Senator Crane, who has the misfortune to chair the estimates committee before which Senator Macdonald appears as a minister.

You have ruled these five questions in order as utterly germane to the bill. These five questions are specifically related to the bill, and the chair has ruled that way.

It is not up to this minister to decide whether or not he will choose to be accountable to the people of Australia in relation to legislation before this chamber, and it is not up to this minister to determine when legislation will be put forwardâunless, in terms of his previous comments, he is indicating that he has some arrangement with the Democrats to guillotine this bill. I would find that extremely difficult to believe. In fact, Senator Greig says that he has no arrangement. So I will restate my five questions, which have been ruled in order in relation to the bill. The chair has not indicated that they are out of order. Minister, if you are incapable of answering them, then why don't you get up and say so and save the Senate some time?

That is why it is important. That is why the people listening to this broadcast would be utterly scandalised by your comments.</para><para>The second question is: if it is discovered as a result of this analysis that the GST in fact has a deleterious impact on councils, what action will the government take?

I understand. I will restate that you have not ruled them out, which you were asked to do by the minister. I appreciate that. I also understand your ruling that it is the minister's prerogative as to whether or not he answers the questions. This bill deals with financial assistance grants to local government and changes therein. The minister himself, in his own contribution on the second reading, has talked about the $15 million that was taken out of local government by the government, but now he refuses to answer any questions on it, despite having alluded to it in his own second reading contribution. How that is not germane I do not know. So, in relation to the $15 million taken out as a result of the freezing of the escalation factors, which are all included in this bill, will the government consider putting that money back in? The minister alluded to it in his own second reading contribution. That is the third question. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The fourth one relates to the GST. This is totally germane to this bill. It goes to the policing powers, in terms of whether councils do or do not pay the GST. That is what this bill is about. This bill is about providing sanctions on councils which in fact do not comply with the GST in relation to the retention of financial assistance grants. How much more specific do we need to get? In relation to that, does the ACCC have, in the minister's view, determinative power? Does it have the power to do that?</para><para>The fifth question is in relation to the GST and its application to local government. Maybe this is a little bit out of the parameters, so, if the minister does not want to answer this fifth one, that is fine. The Local Government Incentive Program was underspent by $1 million by this government in relation to assistance with the implementation of the GST. Why was it underspent by $1 million and what is the government going to do about it? The first four questions are completely relevant and totally germane. If you do not want to answer the fifth one, that is fine. But you are paid to answer questions, so please answer them, or we will be here for a very long time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>14875</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAgain, none of those questions are relevant to this particular bill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âWhy?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âIf you want to enter into debate, ask me questions 1 to 5 during question time, because there is no limit on what you can do at question time.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âWe are here.

In several days time, as the entire nation knows, the Olympic flame will make its way to Uluru. It will begin its journey around the country before the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Sydney on 15 September. It not only marks one of the most important stages of Olympic preparation but also is an element of our celebrations of World Environment Day. This is a day which aims to raise community awareness of environmental issues and their importance, to encourage the community to act responsibly towards the environment and to involve the community in actions that show concern for the environment. There is not much better way for Australia to achieve these aims than to commence the Olympic torch relay in the heart of one of our world heritage listed areas. The United Nations established World Environment Day as an annual event in 1972 and, as a means of promoting global concern for the environment, the General Assembly also created the UN environment program at the same time. </para></talk.start><para>So each year, on 5 June, nations around the world mark the event, offering the opportunity for communities and governments to consider their approaches to natural surroundings. Communities are encouraged to participate, just as governments are encouraged to use the day to highlight their work on the environment and give consideration to the importance of these issues.</para><para>Each year, official World Environment Day events include the presentation of Global 500 Awards, the United Nation's roll of honour for environmental achievement. Previous Australian winners of Global 500 Awards include Greening Australia and Ian Kiernan. Each year, the United Nations selects one nation to host the World Environment Day celebrations. This year, we are proudly that host. This is the first time it has been held in Australia and, indeed, the first time in the Pacific region. This celebration presents Australia with an important opportunity to engage our communities in the acknowledgment of the day and its aims and to acknowledge those who have made significant contributions to caring for the nation's environment and the pursuit of sustainability.</para><para>The theme this year is celebrating excellence, innovation and enterprise in the pursuit of a sustainable Australia, the initiative of the Prime Minister's Environment Awards. They were tremendously well received with over 400 nominations considered. The winners from my state included Coffs Harbour City Council for outstanding sustainability achievements in partnership with their local community and Charlie Carp, a very innovative New South Wales firm which turns environmentally harmful introduced European carp into garden fertiliser. </para><para>As the Australian community and the government have celebrated the day, it is disappointing that some people have chosen to criticise rather than acknowledge the contributions of the coalition in this important area. People are very quick to criticise, but it is worth looking at the Liberal Party's track record, in particular in the area of environmental concern, before taking too much notice of empty criticism. Many are pleased, as we know, to jump on the environmental bandwagon, but it was the Liberal Party that prohibited sandmining on Fraser Island and banned whaling in Australian waters. It was the Liberal Party that declared the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and placed the Barrier Reef, Kakadu, Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and south-west Tasmania on the World Heritage List. Many people might not realise that it was 25 years ago that a coalition government established the first Commonwealth environment department. In 1982, it was the Fraser government that established the National Tree Program to reverse tree decline throughout Australia.</para><para>Now it is the Howard government that is implementing, through the Natural Heritage Trust, the largest and most comprehensive commitment to action on the environment by any national government in Australia's history. And it would be remiss of me, in discussing our environmental credentials, not to mention the role of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator the Hon. Robert Hill, in that process. He has provided an enormous amount of experience, leadership and stability to those pursuits. I understand he is Australia's longest serving minister for the environment, an achievement that indicates his commitment. </para><para>As I have previously mentioned, the coalition have taken an expansive approach to the environment portfolio, with a view that it is very much a mainstream issue. The $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust and the almost $1 billion allocated to greenhouse gas reduction programs are the largest environmental funding commitments in Australia's history. The government are supportive of development and wealth creation. We also have an approach which has been to focus on promoting environmental standards that are in line with the commitment to continued growth. We try to combine our objectives for long-term wealth for the benefit of all Australians with environmental protection in partnership with communities, business and other tiers of government.</para><para>In the last budget, the government continued to provide significant levels of funding for environmental and natural resource projects around Australia, including an allocation of over $880 million to the Environment and Heritage portfolio. That allocation funds the Australian Greenhouse Office, the National Oceans Office, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authorityânow very well run by former president of the New South Wales Legislative Council, Virginia Chadwick.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âHear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>M56</name.id><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>âThank you, Senator Macdonald. It also funds the Australian Heritage Commission. The Natural Heritage Trust has been allocated $361 million for projects over the next year. That continues the work undertaken in programs like Bushcare, Landcare and Coasts and Clean Seas. Greenhouse gas abatement, a key issue, has been allotted $400 million over the four years. Provision has also been made for the development of a product stewardship system for waste oil and, importantly for my state of New South Wales, the preservation of five prominent former Defence sites around Sydney Harbour.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some are keen to fire barbs in regard to the environment budget. It is worth noting the legacy that was left to the coalition by the former government. Over five million hectares of native vegetation in this country were cleared during the decade between 1983 and 1993. Australia was allowed to take its extraordinary endowment of natural resources for granted. That is not necessarily a trend that you can lay entirely at the feet of any one political party, nor is it a concern that is unique to this country, but it is important to note the rapid change in mindset in regard to the environment that has developed in recent times.</para><para>Increasingly, communities are aware that efforts to protect their natural surroundings have to be made before you lose the opportunity to do so. We now have to take that next step, moving beyond recognition to take action to ensure that governments and communities are working together to achieve their environmental aims. It seems that globally there is a number of obvious issues which communities and governments have to consider. Recently I have had a couple of those highlighted around New South Wales. Balancing the competing needs of rural activities with those in urban communities is a significant challenge. Those competing demands were obvious to me in a series of meetings I conducted recently, the first in a large regional city in north-western New South Wales, where community concerns regarding the farming practices of cotton growers in the state's north-west and issues such as salinity were considered.</para><para>On a subsequent visit to an enormous cotton farm in that region, a local cotton grower showed me the substantial effortsâmirrored by many othersâhe had gone to in order to make his farm as environmentally sustainable as possible, including diversification of the products he farmed, creating very exciting new export opportunities. These are not easy conundrums to resolve. Creating economic growth and development while at the same time ensuring environmental protection is a difficult balance to achieve. What is abundantly clear is that the balance is increasingly important as environmental degradation across the globe causes ripple effects. As the world population increases, placing greater strain on our natural resources, with increased demand for food, clean water, power and other essentials, that balance becomes even more precarious. </para><para>Australians and residents of most countries want environmental safeguards, but they also want development, jobs and higher living standards. The approach that the coalition has taken is to ensure that government, industry and the community work together. Community education and engagement are particularly important. We are all able to make a contribution in that process. Once again this year, on Clean Up Australia Day, for example, with my colleague Ross Cameron, the member for Parramatta, Parramatta Liberals banded together to help clean up our local area. We selected a section of Parramatta Park, one of the Greater West's most historic and most important public spaces. With a dedicated group of members and supporters, including scuba divers cleaning the river, we did our part for that day, including discussing some of that work with Ian Kiernan, the founder of Clean Up Australia Day, who was also at Parramatta Park.</para><para>These are important initiatives for several reasons. Clean Up Day achieves a real difference in the environment by cleaning up literally thousands of tonnes of rubbish. I was interested to learn that in last year's clean-up a significant proportion of the rubbish cleared was cigarette butts, meaning that the habit costs Australia doubly, impacting substantially on health and, in fact, on the environment. It is also a day that provides another valuable service in raising the environment as an issue of concern for all Australians. Environmental issues present one of the most difficult areas for government anywhere. As our societies change and become more technologically advanced, and literally larger, our relationship with our natural surroundings is also forced to change. Hand in hand with this, governments and communities need to be prepared to adapt to new ways of protecting their surroundings and to ensure that events such as World Environment Day are truly a celebration.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title><title>Coal Fired Power Stations</title><page.no>14878</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Coal Fired Power Stations</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14878</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to continue on with the theme that Senator Payne was speaking about in relation to the environment, particularly in relation to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. I do welcome the statements of the Prime Minister and the government, and that Senator Payne repeated, about recognising the environment now as a mainstream issue that needs to be very much at the centre of government policy directions, formulations and actions. Certainly, when one looks at the record of the federal government as well as that of state governments around the country, there is a lot that still needs to be improved. Their record certainly leaves a lot to be desired, despite the pronouncements from this government about the so-called largest funded environment program in this nation's history, which was funded through the unfortunate sale of Telstra. As we heard today from the minister himself in question time, the government's own mid-term review about the use of that funding in areas such as Cape York in relation to issues such as vegetation clearance has shown very inadequate results. It is bad enough that we have had to sell part of Telstra to fund this program and bad enough that core environment department funding has been removed and topped up with this NHT funding, but to think that we are spending all that money and still getting inadequate outcomes is a disgrace and a tragedy.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of land clearing, which was mentioned by Senator Payne, is a classic case. I think it is appropriate to point to the failure of past governments to deal with land clearing. The amount of clearance in the previous decade that Senator Payne mentioned is clearly an indictment. What is an even greater indictment is the fact that in Queensland that clearing continues unabated. What have this federal government done about it? They have certainly done a lot of blaming of the state government in Queensland and of Mr Beattie. I can understand that; I would join in criticising the Queensland government in that regard. Criticising is one thing, but when you are the federal government and you are the minister that actually has the power to do something about it, then just complaining about the state government is not adequate enough. What we need is action. The Prime Minister has specifically acknowledged that the land clearing problem continuing unabated in Queensland is a major environmental problem, if not one of the major environmental problems in the countryâyet we have no action. </para><para>We do have the possibility before the federal government at the moment of including a greenhouse trigger in the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which comes into operation next month. That possibility is based on a commitment given to the Democrats last year as part of the government's package for environmental measures around the tax package and also the environment protection bill, as it was at the time. That was a very firm commitment given to the Democrats and indeed to the Senate by the government as a whole, not just by the environment minister operating on his own. The Democrats very much expect the government to deliver on that commitment, particularly given the rhetoric that we have had from government ministers, from the Prime Minister and from government senators in relation to this issue. If it is a serious issue, if it is a central issue and if it is a mainstream issue, then there can no longer be any excuse not to act in this area. Putting in a greenhouse trigger is not the only aspect and not all that is needed to reduce land clearing in Queensland, but it would go a significant way and would catch a significant component of land clearing in Queensland. If the federal government are in any way serious about this issue, as they purport to be, then there is no longer any reason for them not to act at least in that area. I would suggest that more than that needs to be done to fully curtail the outrageous degree of land clearing that continues in Queensland.</para><para>Moving across to the very related issue of greenhouse emissions, we have had more publicity today in relation to the new coal fired power station that is being built in Queensland. This is an issue again where the federal environment minister has been happy to criticise the state government, with some justification. Unfortunately, they have taken no action to do anything about it. There was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 24 MayâI will not quote the journalist in case I get it wrong because I do not have it in front of me hereâthat outlined the clear-cut divisions within cabinet about just this issue. Senator Hill reportedly presented cabinet with a memo arguing that the new Kogan Creek coal fired power station should have to offset greenhouse emissions. His proposal was reportedly strongly opposed by Mr Andersonânot surprisingly, the same minister who is trying to undermine the greenhouse trigger being inserted in the actâand the industry minister, Senator Minchin, who is always referred to as a right-hand man to the Prime Minister. Both of them argued against those proposals of including a greenhouse trigger and of requiring some offsets on the new coal fired power station. They believed that would amount to shifting the goalposts after the company had already met all government requirements. This is not necessarily a criticism of the Kogan Creek developers but a criticism of the inadequacy of government requirements. If we can meet government requirements that allow an expansion of coal fired electricity generationâand this is not the only coal fired power station that is planned for Queenslandâthat highlights how inadequate the requirements are.</para><para>There is no scope in Queensland for power stations to be refused on greenhouse lines. It is simply not part of it and that puts a big hole in the Queensland government's new energy policy. I think it was quite rightly pointed out that a large thrust of that policy was trying to ensure the viability of the gas pipeline between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. Certainly gas is a cleaner fuel than coal in terms of greenhouse and carbon emissions. It is a concern if we put all our hopes in that area of energy generation because it is still clearly a greenhouse emitter. But as a transition fuel it has a lot to be said for it. There are still issues with environmental aspects and traditional landowners in terms of the route of the proposed pipeline through the cape in particular. Those should not be forgotten. It is clear that the Queensland government are very keen to see that gas alternative go ahead. They have set targets, which is very good, for a significant increase in energy generation from sources other than coal over the coming years. Unfortunately, as we have seen at federal level, setting targets is one thing; actually meeting them is another thing again. From the Democrats' perspective, I am very dubious as to the Queensland government's ability to meet those targets. I think in part they are hoping for the federal government to in effect force them to meet them by using mechanisms, such as the greenhouse trigger, which are not in place at the federal level. </para><para>In Queensland there is no scope for proposed future coal fired stations to be stopped on greenhouse grounds. Setting a target, whilst desirable, is not going to make it happen of itself. The Democrats think it is crucial to re-emphasise, to the federal government in particular, the need for action on this area. Climate change and greenhouse issues is probably the number one global environmental issue and it is closely linked to what I would suggest is the number one Australian environmental issue of land clearing in Queensland. The land degradation, salinisation, erosion, loss in water quality, loss in agricultural productivity and the greenhouse emission consequences all add up to a major environmental problem not just for Queensland but for states further south and a major bill for future generations both in terms of the lost environmental values and in terms of economic cost. The amounts of money that have gone into the Natural Heritage Trust are nothing compared to what is going to be needed to be spent to fix up the damage that is still being caused today. In a situation where we know there is a problem and we know we are going to face major damage costs down the track unless we do something now, it is exceptionally negligent and completely inexcusable for governments to continue to procrastinate and not to act.</para><para>There is a lot more to be done beyond putting a greenhouse trigger in the national environment act, but that is certainly one action that is absolutely essential. It will be a key test of whether this government has any credibility in terms of its pronouncements on environmental issues as well as in terms of it being able to stick to the spirit of agreements it has made and the pronouncements it has made about their intentions in this area.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Capability</title><page.no>14880</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14880</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âGiven the disruption we are all aware of in Fiji and the Solomon Islands and the challenges to the democracy in those states and the insecurity it brings to the whole region, it is worthy to focus on Australia's readiness to meet those challenges. One of the best experiences we can focus on as a yardstick is East Timor. While we are all very impressed by the talents displayed by our forces in the field, there are nevertheless lessons to be learned for our defence forces. The truth is that Australia's defence capacities were stretched to the limit. Australia's commitment to INTERFET of 5,000 troops was so great that there were not enough trained troops available for rotation. The government has responded to that by establishing a second brigade sized group on 28 days notice to move. We have not had two brigades of troops on 28 days notice since the Vietnam war.</para></talk.start><para>Another deficiency revealed by the Timor operation was the lack of control and command facilities on Australian naval units deployed. This meant we relied upon the United States supplied naval vessels which had these capacities. Clearly, Australia must have such a capability as well as heavy lift helicopters, which were necessary to deploy equipment into the mountainous interior of East Timor. Again, these were provided by two American naval vessels. In my view, Timor shows Australia needs an aircraft carrier for effective future operations in the region. It is also not well known that several of the most important operations in East Timor involved amphibious landings where troops had to be deployed directly onto the beaches. Australia had a very limited capability for such operations. The Navy's HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline> was fully engaged together with HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Jervis Bay</inline>, the Navy's single troop deployment catamaran. Australia should have had the capacity with the two American amphibious naval vessels purchased in 1994, but the two ships have cost hundreds of millions of dollars in repair and refit costs and are yet to be deployedâa situation not dissimilar to the defence department's Collins class submarine contracts, again signed by the previous government. These submarines required the recent budget commitment by this government of $100 million to design changes for them. </para><para>These are criticisms of past naval purchases. The Air Force have been smarter in their choices. The FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft is Australia's primary air defence response asset. The Hornet can also contribute to strategic strike protection of shipping and land support tasks, all beneficial to the East Timor experience. When acquired in the late 1980s, the Hornet was the most capable fighter aircraft in our region. The aircraft life is up to 30 years and on current projections the Hornet fleet will have to be replaced no later than around 2012. Technology has caught up with the 1980s purchase. The options available to the ADF were to accept a declining capability until retirement in 2015, replace the aircraft now or upgrade the Hornet fleet to restore a relative capability edge. Upgrading the Hornet fleet was considered to be affordable and capable of providing the higher level of capability needed, particularly when combined with the acquisition of new missiles and airborne early warning and control aircraft.</para><para>The decision to upgrade the Hornet fleet has been essential in meeting our medium-term capabilities. On current strategic assessment, the upgrade will allow replacement of the aircraft to be deferred to 2015. It should be noted that certain failures within the defence department should be seen as a reflection on the administrative structures under which the department runs, rather than on its service personnel. So it really is crunch time for our defence forces. The East Timor incident has accentuated and accelerated the big decisions that now have to be made. Timor has added about $1 billion a year to our defence bill over the next four years. Over the next decade and a half we will need approximately $830 million to replace obsolete equipment. I stress `replace' equipmentânot `increase' the force's equipment. </para><para>For example, Australia within the next decade will have to replace its F-18 aircraft and its FFG-7 frigates, its Hercules transport aircraft and its army transport vehicle fleet. But rest assured, we have a minister in charge of defence who is well aware of this mammoth task and the challenges ahead. That is why the government commissioned a defence white paper even before the Timor crisis. The white paper will determine the future shape of Australia's defence forces. The minister has also acted to install a new department secretary as a measure of his determination to bring to account the top brass in defence. To quote the minister from a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, he says: </para><quote><para>By the end of 2000, I aim to have in place management which is accountable and responsible for its own actions and be able to manage Defence in a way (that) the Government can have confidence that when it gives them money it will spend it wisely. Currently, there is no confidence that they would spend it wisely. </para></quote><para>As there has never been a government that is not electorally sensitiveâand I would venture to say that this government is no exceptionâit is paramount to be able to take the taxpayers with us on such future major commitments. Consider what the defence budget is competing with. Firstly, it is competing with a surplus budget. Secondly, it is competing with a debt reduction strategy. Thirdly, it is competing with a `no new government borrowings' commitment. Fourthly, and above all, it is competing with the political pull by the rural and regional areas for greater infrastructure expenditure. As an aside, is it any wonder that this government seeks to sell Telstra and liquidate its $50 billion worth of capital? But that is another story for another day.</para><para>In conclusion, the release of the defence white paper later this year will bring these decisions to a head and set the trend in expenditure for decades to come.

national rates at different times, over different periods, to give an equitable outcome. The funding equalisation and assistance package provides for an extra $148 million over 6 years to 2005-06 in recurrent payments.</para><para>Those States below the national average will reach the national average in 2002 instead of never under Labor's policy and 2004 under coalescence.</para><para>Queensland will gain $83.6m, South Australia will gain $14.7m, Western Australia will gain $3.5m and the Australia Capital Territory will gain $0.3m. For these states, this new money will dramatically accelerate their increase in funding. This response clearly addresses the issue of equity between states and provides for uniform national rates to be achieved two years earlier on 1 July 2002.</para><para>Victoria will gain $39.6m and Tasmania will gain $6.3m. For these states, this will ensure ongoing annual increases in funding, each year. The response will also enable more time for the sector to manage the transition, as uniform national rates for Victoria and Tasmania will instead be achieved two years later on 1 July 2006.

The Department is aware of the report, and its focus in Chapter Eight on health issues affecting educational achievement among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. </para><para>	(2) Yes.  The Department has funded a systematic review of existing evidence on otitis media in Indigenous populations to establish the evidence-base for the treatment and management of otitis media. </para><para>	(3) The systematic review showed the prevalence of otitis media among Indigenous populations surveyed over the last 40 years varied from 11% to 90%. </para><para>In contrast, the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1995 National Health Survey reported that 4.1% of non-Indigenous children under 5 years had had acute otitis media. </para><para>	(4) Yes. Recommendations for Clinical Care Guidelines on the Management of Otitis Media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Populations currently being finalised under contract to the department refer explicitly to the World Health Organisation's recommendation that rates of chronic suppurative otitis media higher than 4% are unacceptable and represent a public health problem.  The Recommendations define high-risk populations as those experiencing rates of chronic suppurative otitis media greater than 4%.</para><para>	(5) Yes.  The association between hearing disability and educational achievement has been documented in a number of reports. </para><para>	(6) The Government's approach to hearing impairment within Indigenous communities is based on recognising the importance of primary health care in preventing ear diseases which may lead to hearing loss, and the provision of hearing services to assist where hearing impairment has occurred.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">General Primary Health Focus</inline></para><para>The Department of Health and Aged Care has developed a comprehensive long-term strategic framework for improving Indigenous health.  Implicit in this framework is the recognition that there are no easy or quick solutions in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The strategy has four main components: </para><para>. Developing the infrastructure and resources necessary to achieve comprehensive and effective primary health care for Indigenous Australians;</para><para>. Addressing some of the specific health issues and risk factors affecting the health status of Indigenous Australians;</para><para>. Improving the evidence base which underpins the health interventions; and </para><para>. Improving communication with primary health care services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the general population.</para><para>Achievement of the first component is primarily through the funding and development of a national network of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. </para><para>Hearing Strategy </para><para>Building on the national network of Aboriginal community controlled health services and in response to recommended goals of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (1989), the Government in December 1996 approved implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Hearing Strategy 1995/96 - 1998/1999.  This Strategy is continuing with an evaluation being undertaken this year.</para><para>This Strategy aims to provide a strategic approach to improving Indigenous hearing health by targeting children 0-5 years through primary health care organisations, with a focus on hearing and broader child health services. The Strategy consists of four main elements:  </para><para>Child Hearing Health Sites: 30 Aboriginal community controlled health services were identified as the Child Hearing Health Sites to incorporate hearing screening and treatment into a comprehensive 0-5 year old child health program. Funding is being provided to employ specialist hearing health workers in each of these sites to improve coordination and continuity of care between health care and education sectors at the regional level. </para><para>Equipment and Training: An audiometric equipment and two-stage training program is being provided by services funded by the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health. </para><para>Since 1996, 512 Aboriginal Health Workers have participated in hearing health training, with 216 having completed both stages of the training program;</para><para>To date, 105 sets of audiometric equipment have been issued to Aboriginal community controlled health services. An ongoing equipment maintenance and calibration regime is also in place. </para><para>Capital Infrastructure Program: Soundproof testing facilities have been, or are in the process of being established in 29 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services to improve access to community based specialist hearing testing facilities.</para><para>Strategic Research: The Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health in collaboration with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Aboriginal community controlled health sector, has undertaken a process to strengthen the strategic focus and evidence base for activities addressing hearing impairment, and to maximise effective resource use. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Projects funded under this element of the strategy are:</inline></para><para>. Evaluation of tympanoplasty in Aboriginal children in WA and factors associated with successful outcome.  This project aims to evaluate the outcome of operations done to repair eardrums in Aboriginal children and identify factors associated with successful outcomes. </para><para>. Socioeconomic risk factors and treatment seeking behaviour for otitis media in the aboriginal population of Kalgoorlie-Boulder region.  This study is investigating socioeconomic factors predisposing children to ear infections and the effect of these factors on compliance with treatment in Kalgoorlie-Boulder Indigenous populations.</para><para>. Improving Medical Services for rural and remote Aboriginal children with chronic suppurative otitis media.   This project aims to describe the progression or resolution of chronic suppurative otitis media in affected children over a 2Â½-year period.</para><para>In addition these projects funded under the Strategy, the department has provided over $2 million since 1994 for research into otitis media in Indigenous populations.  Ten separate projects have been funded and a further $1 million is subject to offer of award for 2000 and the out years. </para><para>(7) In addition to the initiatives outlined above under question 6, the Australian Hearing Services (AHS) provides a range of Community Service Obligations under the Commonwealth Hearing Services Program.  This includes services to eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The AHS Australian Hearing Specialist Programs for Indigenous Australians (AHSPIA) addresses the effects of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in particular.  This strategy aims to promote access to rehabilitative services, while also screening for early episodes of acute otitis media in order to refer clients for appropriate medical treatment.</para><para>The AHSPIA program operates from special outreach centres. The number of outreach centres visited and the number of visits may vary from year to year.  Most of these centres are in remote areas but a few are in urban areas such as Redfern in Sydney.  At the end of December 1999 there had been 161 visits to 93 different sites across mainland Australia.  There were a total of 260 visits to 98 sites in the 98/99.  Many of these visits were for a period of up to one week. </para><para>The AHSPIA program delivers hearing services in a culturally sensitive way in surroundings that are comfortable and familiar.  Participation of local Aboriginal Health Workers in service delivery is actively encouraged with training, supervision and support being given where appropriate.  There is an emphasis on working with the family and community to get the best outcomes.</para><para>Initially AHSPIA programs are put in place at the request of agents such as local community organisations, schools, health workers and State government and community controlled health services. Visiting programs are built from this base with the number and type of programs planned and delivered depending on factors such as:  </para><para>. the availability of appropriate hearing screening results supplied by local health workers, nurses, doctors, etc; </para><para>. the prevalence of individuals in the community with active ear disease and associated hearing loss; </para><para>. the need for individual and/or school based amplification; and </para><para>. the willingness of community members and local support services to participate in ongoing programs.</para><para>(8) No. However population level data on the prevalence of otitis media in Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities are available, as are data on literacy.  The population data relating to Indigenous communities show a clear correlation between the high prevalence of otitis media and poor literacy levels.  It should be noted however, that otitis media is one of a number of factors impacting on literacy levels in Indigenous populations.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Irian Jaya</title><page.no>14902</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2124)</subtitle><id.no>2124</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14902</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Does Australia recognise Indonesia's renaming of Irian Jaya as West Papua</para><para>	(2) (a) Has the Dutch Government agreed to a re-examination of the historical validity of the hand over of West Papua to Indonesia; and</para><para>	(b) will Australia re-examine the hand over.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14902</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) When President Wahid visited Irian Jaya on 31 December 1999, he agreed to change the name to Papua.

The ACA is an important source of information for the Inquiry.</para><para>	(6) The Inquiry has a secretariat of 13 staff.  Eleven staff have been drawn from various areas of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, based on skills and experience of the staff involved and the impact of their withdrawal from normal Departmental duties.

The final itinerary has yet to be determined to ensure the issues highlighted in the Submission process can be taken into account.  Consultations will be held in the form of both round table forums to which community groups, individuals and industry groups will be invited to participate (and which the public and media will be able to observe), and direct meetings with individuals and organisations, including those identified as a result of the submission process.

It is inappropriate to discuss their affairs in the Parliament. Any person who has exhausted the child support administrative processes can apply to a court having family court jurisdiction to have that court make a decision.</para><para>	(2) (a) No. There is no provision under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 for the Minister to influence the operation of the legislation. Administration of child support rests with the Registrar. However, in practice the Minister might ask for a briefing about a particular issue and provide his/her perspective or opinion about that issue.</para><para>	(b) The Child Support Agency is part of the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS). Within this portfolio, The Hon Larry Anthony MP, Minister for Community Services has specific responsibility for the Child Support Agency (CSA). </para><para>	(3) The CSA is not a party to an application to court under s110 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989; therefore this information is not known to the CSA. However, where a parent is not satisfied with a Part 6A decision and objection outcome, it would be open to the parent to apply to the court under s116 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 for a decision. Again, the CSA is not a party to a s116 application.</para><para>	(4) (a) Advice of this nature would be sought by the CSA, not the Minister's Office</para><para>	(b) The Minister's Office has not sought advice from the Attorney-General's Office with regards to Part 6A of the Act.</para><para>	(5) (a) The Child Support Registrar sought advice from the Australian Government Solicitor regarding Part 6A of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. </para><para>	(b) The advice was sought on 1 February 2000. </para><para>	(c) The advice was received by the CSA on 10 March 2000.</para><para>	(6) The legislation gives the Registrar the power to approve all application forms for the purposes of child support acts. This application form was appropriately approved.</para><para>	(7) The changes were part of a large program of reforms to improve equity and fairness and to reduce red tape and increase accountability. Input was received from a range of sources, including recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues of 1994. </para><para>	(8) During the year ending 30 June 1999, 31,354 applications were received to change the assessment. 22,358 proceeded to conference. Of these 14,182 were varied. In 6,363 cases the assessment was increased, and in 7,819 it was decreased.</para><para>	(9) There are no grounds on which the validity of s110 is under challenge. The CSA is not a party to an application to court under s110 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. Where a parent is not satisfied with a Part 6A decision and objection outcome, it would be open to the parent to apply to the court under s116 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 for a decision. Again, the CSA is not a party to a s116 application. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Boards of Management</title><page.no>14908</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2150)</subtitle><id.no>2150</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14908</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 10 April 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) How many agencies within the Minister's portfolio are administered by a board.</para><para>	(2) Are all members of the above boards appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Council; if not, who is responsible for making board appointments.</para><para>	(3) In each case, does the Remuneration Tribunal have a role in the setting of fees, allowances and other benefits for members of the boards; if not: (a) under which section of the relevant legislation are such fees, allowances and benefits authorised; and (b) how is the value of these fees, allowances and other benefits determined.</para><para>	(4) In each case, what is the nature and value of fees paid to board members.</para><para>	(5) What other benefits, such as mobile phones, home computers and home phone/facsimile machines, are provided to board members by virtue of their membership of a government board.</para><para>	(6) What class of air travel, what standard of accommodation and what car allowances are paid to board members and, in each case, what is the value of these benefits and who determines that value.</para><para>	(7) Are board members entitled to, or do they receive, any spouse benefits; if so, what is the nature and value of these benefits.</para><para>	(8) (a) On how many occasions since January 1998 have the above fees, allowances and other benefits been varied, (b) what was the reason for each variation; and (c) what was the quantum of each variation.</para><para>	(9) If variations to fees, allowances and other payments to board members were not determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, who determined the quantum and timing of each increase.</para><para>	(10) Do board members qualify for, and are they paid, superannuation benefits; if so, are such payments additional to, and separate from, other allowances they receive.</para><para>	(11) Do board members receive any additional allowances if they are appointed to board sub-committees; if so, are such additional benefits provided for in the relevant legislation.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14908</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Two agencies are administered by a boardâCentrelink and Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS).</para><para>	(2) <inline font-weight="bold">Centrelinkâ</inline>No. Appointments to the Centrelink Board of Management are made by the Minister responsible for Centrelink. <inline font-weight="bold">AIFSâ</inline>Yes</para><para>	(3) <inline font-weight="bold">Centrelinkâ</inline>Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">AIFSâ</inline>Yes</para><para>	(4) <inline font-weight="bold">Centrelinkâ</inline>The Chairman of the Centrelink Board of Management is currently paid $58,000 pa.
