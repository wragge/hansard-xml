The government has the hide to bring before the Senate a motion with the anticipation that there will be no debate for the cut-off to be applied to six pieces of legislation when, in the House of Representatives, the government is refusing to debate and is placing a gag on the mandatory sentencing legislation which went through the Senate a couple of weeks ago. There has to be recognition by the government that the Senate regards mandatory sentencing legislation seriously and that it believes that the House of Representatives has a responsibility to treat it seriously. I am not saying anything other than that the government has put onto the House of Representatives a decision through numbers that mandatory sentencing will be dealt with by the executive and not by the parliament. In effect, it has created a situation whereby the Senate has wasted its time deliberating on a matter which it took to be important and which certainly the people of Australia are saying they believe is important. </para></talk.start><para>The government is simply shrugging its shoulders at that, cocking a snoot at the Senate, showing a cavalier attitude to public opinion in this country and simply saying, `Business as usualâexcept when it comes to the Senate's legislation.' What will be next? It is very clear that the government is saying that the Senate is a matter to be dealt with by the executive and no longer has a relationship with the House of Representatives, at least when the flow is from this place to the House. As a democrat, I will not except that. I believe there is a responsibility on the part of the government to discuss the mandatory sentencing legislation, to put it to debate and to do so as a matter of expedition. I do not believe we should be accepting a situation where, day in and day out, the government says, `Business as usual' in this house but in the other place would have a corruption of the democratic process, an affront to the Constitution and a denigration of democratic propriety. This is a serious matter, and it has been compounded by the fact that, every day last week, an opposition motion which gained majority support in this place, calling on the House of Representatives to debate the Senate's mandatory sentencing bill, has been totally ignored. Worse than ignored--when the opposition tried to have that motion from the Senate dealt with, to draw attention to the importance with which the Senate treats mandatory sentencing, the government simply used its numbers to prevent an adequate debate and to prevent the bill from being debated.</para><para>Had the government done the right thing, this matter would now be settled, at least as far as that legislation is concerned. I do not understand the tactics, but they are wrong. The House of Representatives is the proper place for the Senate to see its business done, the same as it is the responsibility of the Senate to do the House of Representatives' bidding. Here we have six pieces of legislation, and some of them are mightily important. The reason we are being asked to exempt them from the cut-off is that the government wants them through the parliament before we break for winterâhopefully, before the budget and, it would appear, certainly in the next week or two. This is urgent government and House of Representatives business. The Senate should treat it in at least a formal fashion. I am not going to take up the Prime Minister's position: there will be no debate. What would happen if we were to say, `Let's have tit for tat here: no debate in the Senate'? If the government of this country took the Howard line, it would grind to a halt. The Senate is more responsible than to fall to that low level of democratic response.</para><para>But nor am I saying we should just shrug our shoulders, go through a few manoeuvres and then say, `Well, business as usual.' This is too important. Mandatory sentencing is too important. Likewise, the relationship between the houses is too important. Remember that these pieces of legislation are not urgent because they are dealing with matters which have arisen urgently. Without exception, they are matters that the government has brought before the House of Representatives, dealt with there and then brought to the Senate in a tardy fashion. In one of the pieces of legislation, a tax bill which deals with fringe benefits and the Medicare levy surcharge, the government's excuse for urgency is:</para><quote><para>The measures commence on 1 April 2000.</para></quote><para>From my look at a calendar, that is a fortnight ago. It also says:</para><quote><para>Passage of the legislation will provide employers with certainty about the details of the new measures.</para></quote><para>Thank you very much! If they wanted certainty, the government should have had this legislation up here and passed weeks ago, so that the measures which commence on 1 April would have had the certainty that is required. The government has not done that.</para><para>On the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000,</inline> the government says: </para><quote><para>This Bill needs to be introduced and passed in the Autumn sitting of Parliament to ensure the ACCC has adequate powers to prevent businesses from using the GST to exploit customers. </para></quote><para>I know that this Senate is going to pass that legislation. I believe the government should have had that through here months ago, because consumers all over the country are worried that the GST is going to lead to business practices all over the place which will unfairly disadvantage them. This bill will pass the Senate. Is it more or less important than mandatory sentencing? You cannot measure these things. That, along with the other four pieces of legislation, are all important matters and they will be dealt with by the Senate. But if they do not meet the cut-off, it is the government's responsibility.</para><para>Finally, I point out that I am very concerned that the cut-off provision, which former Greens WA Senator Christabelle Chamarette had a lot to do with, and which the government supportedâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âI made a good speech in support of it at the time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âThat would be one of many, Senator Faulkner. The cut-off provision was brought into this place for very good reasons: so that we did not have bills dropped on us at the leisure of the government with the Senate not having time to properly communicate with the electorate, get feedback and then deal with them in a properly informed fashion. That cut-off is there for very important reasons. The requests for exemptions need to come with very important reasons as well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The exemptions being sought today, almost without exception, are simply due to tardiness by the government, a failure to get its business here in time to ensure that the cut-off was not required. For example, the government has been working on the legislation attendant on the GST since the last election two years ago. The rash of bills coming in now simply points to its own lack of preparedness for this major change to the taxation system, which the government itself has brought in and has prepared for years and which it should be carrying through in a more ordered and disciplined manner than we see here.</para><para>I do not believe that the Senate should be allowing the principle of the cut-off, which is to enable us to work in a better way for the electorate, to be serially downgraded, treated in a cavalier fashion, or not taken seriously at all, to the point where I know what is coming down the line. That is a move to rescind it, to get rid of it so that, in future, government measures, particularly contentious matters, will be able to be dumped on the Senate without adequate time and shoved through here under pressure without being adequately dealt with and without the feedback from the electorate which is so important to proper and informed debate. It is a serious matter to oppose this particular motion. But it comes out of the government's own delinquency, its own affront to the Constitution, its own derogation of duty to uphold the proper democratic procedures which are important if you are to work under the dictum that information is the currency of democracy, that the parliament is the houses of the people, and that matters as important as mandatory sentencing and indeed those that we have listed here under this motion not only have feedback from the electorate but have their fair and proper debating time in both houses.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13631</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak briefly on the proposition before the chair. On this occasion, the opposition will be supporting the government's proposal for an exemption of certain bills from the provisions of standing order 111 or, as we better know it, the cut-off for legislation. But I want to say this. I do understand the sense of frustration that Senator Brown has in relation to the failure of the House of Representatives to deal with the mandatory sentencing bill which has been passed by this chamber and which has received a number of messages now asking the House to deal with the bill as a matter of urgency.</para></talk.start><para>What we have to look at here is: what is an appropriate response for the Senate in the circumstances where the Senate has passed a bill in relation to a matter that is front and centre in terms of public policy debate in this country at this time and the House refuses to deal with it? I ask myself the question: what is an appropriate response in this circumstance? I suppose I ask myself whether eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth parliamentarianism is the way to go. My answer to that question is that it is not, that we have a situation where the Senate is obviously dependent on the goodwill and the decency of the Prime Minister to have the House of Representatives deal with a bill that has been passed by the Senate on mandatory sentencing. I think everyone in this chamber is well aware that goodwill and decency are not attributes of the current Prime Minister. His position on this important issue of mandatory sentencing is very clear to see. It requires the Prime Minister's goodwill and decency for the matter to be debated in the House of Representatives. </para><para>The argument that we present here is not necessarily that the House of Representatives and the government have to fall over and agree with what the Senate puts up. But at least the Prime Minister should have the intestinal fortitude to allow the people's house, the House of Representatives, to debate an important bill which has been passed by this chamber, which this chamber has given priority to and which this chamber sees as very urgent. I think most Australians accept that the issue of mandatory sentencing is very urgent but, for some reason or other, the Prime Minister is either unwilling or unable, or both, to allow this matter to come on for debate. That is denying the exemption of bills motion before the chair an appropriate response. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is not an appropriate response.</para><para>We do not want to see the Senate engage in creating havoc in relation to the government's legislative program. As Senator Brown would probably point out, this is a far more responsible view of the world than the current government ever adopted when it was in opposition. As far as the Labor Party in opposition is concerned, we do try and maintain some consistency in the positions that we adopt. We would have argued the same in government as we are arguing now in opposition. There is no point vandalising the parliamentary procedures and processes. That is the sort of thing that the Liberal and National parties warmly embrace when they find themselves in opposition. There is a point in keeping the pressure right on the Prime Minister. I accept that there is a point in the Senate doing that. But this mechanism, which is just about causing havoc and very unreasonable obstruction to a government's legislative program, is something which the opposition simply cannot agree with and will not embrace. Our position on that will be consistent whether we find ourselves in opposition or in government.</para><para>That does not alter the fact that the significance of the substantive point that Senator Brown makes about the importance of mandatory sentencing and the need for the government to bring that bill on for debate in the House of Representatives is in no way lessened by the fact that the opposition will not agree to Senator Brown's proposal to oppose the cut-off motion in this instance. It is just that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth approach is not the way to go. I do not want to descend into using the same tactics that the Liberals and Nationals so warmly embrace. I think that the obligation is on Mr Howard to allow the bill to come on for debate, but we need to be a bit more creative in finding other ways of encouraging that to occur. On this issue the pressure, in a political sense, is right on the government, right on Mr Howard, right on the cabinet and right on the Liberal and National Party party rooms to ensure that there is a decent outcome on the issue of mandatory sentencing. It would be a tactical error on the Senate's part to up-end the flow of legislation before both chambers of the Australian parliament as a response. We will keep the focus on Mr Howard and his lack of courage in allowing this matter to come on for debate. His gutlessness is indefensible, but you do not go to the extent that Senator Brown wants to go to in response. It is for those reasons that the opposition will support the motion that stands in the name of Senator Troeth.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13633</page.no><id.no>R1012</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13633</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>13633</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 on behalf of the opposition. This legislation seeks to ensure that the child support system applies fairly and equally to those living outside Australia, whether they be a payer of child support or whether they be a recipient. The bill also amends Australia's domestic law in order to enable Australia to fulfil its international child and spousal maintenance obligations. The proposed amendments provide for regulations to be made for matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities.</para></talk.start><para>The following are some examples of the changes: the enforcement of administrative assessments allowing the Child Support Agency to make an administrative assessment, even though the payer is not resident in Australia and does not have an Australian taxable income; in the case of New Zealand, providing that the creation and variation of liabilities will only be able to be undertaken in the country where the payee is resident; obliging each country to assist in locating payers, serving notices and providing advice so that maintenance liabilities can be enforced; allowing the Child Support Agency to collect overseas maintenance liabilities which have not first been registered in an Australian court under the Family Law Act 1975; and also requiring reciprocity in legislative presumptions of parentage. All these measures appear to the opposition to be uncontroversial in nature and, accordingly, we support the bill that is before the chamber today. I believe that the opposition have also indicated they are willing to see this matter be debated as uncontroversial legislation, if that was the wish of other parties and senators in the chamber. </para><para>Let me make a few observations about the Child Support Scheme in indicating the support of the opposition for this bill. The introduction of the scheme a decade ago attempted to put in place a set of principles which very few could disagree with. Those principles are that parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity and that adequate support is available for all children not living with both their parents. Of course, the other important reason for the establishment of the Child Support Scheme was the principle that the government should not be expected to pay the costs of supporting a child where one or both parents have the wherewithal to do so unassisted.</para><para>The problems many currently have with the system lie in the judgments it makes about people's capacity to pay, in what circumstances exceptions should be made, and how the collection of payments is enforced. The difficulty lies in the fact that complaints about child support are divided evenly between those who pay and those who receive. For every aggrieved payer who argues they are forced to give too much to the upbringing of their child, there is a payee arguing they are struggling to meet these costs and they have not got their payments through on time. Some of the issues are resolvable if the government of the day is prepared to work through the issues and talk to the people whom the scheme makes requirements of or guarantees to. But it is important to recognise that the system will never have the capacity to resolve the disappointments and hurt that often go hand in hand with separation and divorce.</para><para>The successful resolution of these very human problems and issues lies outside the scope of the Child Support Scheme. I must say that I think this is an area in which the current government has failed to show leadership and support. Since 1996, the government has stripped around $5 billion of social services and other support from our community, creating a huge social deficit. These services, of course, directly assist people to cope with the personal dimension of separation. The government has introduced an unfair taxâthe goods and services taxâthat actively discriminates against low income earners. Child support payers and payees struggling to mend their lives and get on are going to be slugged by the GST. It will push up the cost of child support and it will put ordinary people under further stress. </para><para>I think the parliament has an obligation to make the child support system as fair and as painless as we can, and I think we still have some way to go before we can truly say that child maintenance is being delivered in this way. But, as I have indicated to the Senate, the opposition is satisfied that the measures set out in this bill are a step in the right direction; and because they are a step in the right direction, the opposition takes the view that they are worthy of our support. It is for those reasons, as I have indicated, that the opposition will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13634</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to open my remarks by indicating, firstly, very clearly that Pauline Hanson's One Nation does support the requirements for parents to provide for their children in a separation process. The problems that we have with the <inline ref="R1012">Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> that the government has before us move more towards its unconstitutional sections. I would like to speak to those sections at this point in time. These sections of the bill have the capacity to do two things: to produce a regulation that will be able to override the principal act, and I believe that that is not the intention of legislation within Australia. It will clearly give the regulations the ability to make sections of the act subservient. The other thing that this bill introduces is for the regulations, through international conventions, to enable an order that is derived in a foreign country to have legal effect in Australia without affording an Australian citizen the right of redress in an Australian court.</para></talk.start><para>I believe the Attorney-General, in his process of improving the child support sections of the legislation, is actually introducing some draconian issues. Whether he is aware of them or not we will see in the responses from the minister. But I would like to ask: how long will the Senate wait before taking decisive action on what is the real head of power in this issueâthe Family Law Court? How many more parents, predominantly fathers, must die from desperation after being alienated from their children? Is the Senate aware that in Australia each week more than 20 fathers who are subject to child support orders commit suicide? In actuality, there are more fathers who have died by their own hand than there are Australians who died during the landing at Gallipoli. That is an enormous indictment on our society: that, in an endeavour to provide for childrenâand, as I said earlier, that is what we as a society are required to doâwe have placed on the non-custodial parent such pressures that they have no recourse other than to take their own lives.</para><para>Both men's and women's lobby groups are opposed to the way in which changes to the Family Law Act are being implemented. Social commentators such as Robert Kelso claim the existence of systemic corruption. The Auditor-General's most recent report is less than flattering, and the parliament's own committee, chaired by Roger Price, was scathing in its condemnation of the Child Support Agency and its policies, practices and conduct. Many argue that the proposals will be dangerous and counter-productive, to the point of increasing the already high suicide rate that I have already mentioned.</para><para>The draconian measures that are being implemented hide the real problem that sits behind the process. These processes lie in the disgraceful and dysfunctional nature of all that falls under the wider family law umbrella in Australia. They say that the CSA, in making quasi-judicial decisions that are virtually impossible to appeal, often has the effect of putting parents into debt unfairlyâa debt that is unreasonable, false, contrived and without legal merit. Many may possibly have been jailed as a result of these unreasonable decisions. Many have been placed in the predicament where they cannot provide for themselves or, in cases where the non-custodial parent re-marries and there are children as a result of the second marriage, who are in the position where they cannot provide for their second family as well. The children of that second family do not have the same rights as the children of the first family. My colleagues from the Democrats appear to doubt in the efficiency of more draconian measures such as jailing. Some may say that Labor is completely in the pockets of the feminist lobby and the government and that it just wants to grab the cash from overstretched fathers, no matter in what the social on-costs may be.  </para><para>The debate over the possibility of jailing parents must consider how many more children will not be told the truth; that is, `Daddy has quietly closed the door and the windows, switched on the gas and gone away.' The Australian Democrats do not support imprisonment as a primary enforcement option. The Labor Party supports the jailing of those who fail to pay maintenance but not those who refuse to comply with parenting orders. The Family Court already has provisions for jailing and imposition of fines. The CSA can seize assets, impose penalties, and sweep bank accountsâand I will speak about that later. They can also impose initial prosecutions for a six-month jail penalty A re-evaluation of child support is happening around the world, and many men are facing mounting debts. I will use the name `Frank' for an example. Frank faces mounting debts and has found himself in a surreal world post-separation. The CSA is not bound by rules of evidence. If Frank is charged, tried and jailed, secrecy clauses mean his case cannot be reported. A Family Court ruling cannot be appealed on an error of fact. The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, in introducing the Family Law Amendment Bill 1999, has reopened a broader debate and that is the dysfunction of family law, highlighted by the jailing initiatives. This has reignited calls for a non-adversarial tribunal system to replace the Family Court and to focus attention on the CSA. </para><para>Six years ago a joint select committee made history for the number of submissions made to itâ163 submissions. The exhaustive report of that committee said that there were many complaints about the CSA, including inconsistency of advice, administrative errors and refusal to verify data. It said, `The inaction or lack of service is inexcusable, and the end result is often appalling client service delivery.' Many of the report's 163 recommendationsâincluding an external review of the CSA `as a matter of priority', close study of its social impacts, its impacts on families, disincentives to work, and the reassessment of the child support formulaâhave not, in those six years, been carried out. </para><para>Mr Robert Kelso says that jailing would exacerbate the high suicide rate among parents separated from their children. He says the CSA is a self-contained bureaucracy whose clientsâthat is, the non-custodial parentsâhave `no way out of the legal system.' He says that the 1994 inquiry into the CSA, read in conjunction with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the time, clearly indicates systemic corruption by public servants whose objective was to minimise the cost to the Commonwealth of supporting single parents by welfare by maximising revenue from their non-custodial spouses. He said,</para><quote><para>Neither the Labor government nor its Liberal successors have been interested in examining the behaviour of these public servants.</para></quote><para>The proposal to have overseas court decisions binding on Australian citizens, without right of redress in an Australian court, is totally unacceptable. It casts a shadow over the Attorney-General's well-intentioned attempt to reform family law. The federal government has already encouraged separating couples to avoid, where possible, the Family Court, in favour of mediation and counselling, and discouraged litigation by cutting legal aid. The Attorney-General's overall idea is to create a streamlined federal magistrate service with a hefty startup budget of $30 million, to begin operating midyear, to partially sideline the Family Court, then make court orders enforceable so children would not be denied money or a relationship with their non-custodial parentâthe biggest beefs on either side of the custodial divide. The proposed laws have appeased no-one.</para><para>The Attorney-General has been asked to answer questions on the legality or constitutionality of the legislation. He has declined to say how many children will be ensured a continuing relationship with their non-jailed parent and why he is handing more power to the judges of the Family Court and the Child Support Agency. The Attorney-General also declines to say whether jailed parents will be placed on suicide watch. The rate of suicide of non-custodial male spouses is five times greater than that of youths or females. Griffith University research psychologist Susie Sweeper, an expert on separation, says there are high levels of stress associated with the Family Court and the CSA. She says, `The accumulation of stress from not seeing children, low finances, litigation and a low level of social support can lead to psychopathology such as suicide. Some parents are very angryâthat is certainly expressed.' </para><para>The policy director of the CSA, Sheila Bird, said that Australians have much to be proud of, with 90 per cent of liabilities having been paid since the agency's inception. She claims that this is the world's best. She disputes doubts raised by men's groups about the honesty of the agency's review officers, and she disputes claims made by many paying parents that the formula used by the CSA is inflexible and fails to take into account individual circumstances. Bird says she does not know the suicide rate among paying parents.</para><para>The chairman of the 1994 committee on the child support scheme, Roger Price, said that no-one should think the CSA was set up for the benefit of children. He said its sole rationale was to save taxpayers' money by clawing back social security payments, as each dollar paid by a parent reduces the amount of social security paid to the recipient, and so it is not indicative of what is in the best interests of the children. He said that we have to find a less battering, bruising and financial crippling system.</para><para>I would like to move now to some cases that have been brought to my notice. A person, who I will refer to as `James', has four children aged between 10 and 15 years, and he sees them for more than 40 per cent of the time.

What this bill does, in effect, is to neutralise the Senate's ability to debate freely an act of parliament on behalf of the Australian people that we represent. I believe that it is grossly unfair that a regulation that will have effect on sections of this bill has not been produced. We have not seen the regulation. We do not know how the department is even going to make provisions for changes in the exchange rate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>13636</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank senators for their contributions to the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I particularly welcome the comment by Senator Faulkner that these measures are a step in the right direction. The previous Labor government found, as we have also found, that we are very much in the position of King Solomon when dealing with child support matters. It is extremely difficult dealing with two upset parents, and children who are being sharedâor not shared, as the case might beâbetween them. The issue of money adds fuel to the fire. </para></talk.start><para>Nevertheless, when we were in opposition we were supportive of the recommendations that were made by the Price committee, which reviewed in 1994 the operation of the child support legislation. Senator Harris has not been here for very long, so he may not be aware of this, but since we have been in government we have been moving constantly forward, trying to implement as many of the Price committee's recommendations as possible. I think it is now fair to say that, while some people would still feel that there is more to be done, this government has implemented the majority of the recommendations made by that committee, either in whole where it has been possible or in part where that has been necessary. Having said that, this bill does have support from the three parties in the Senateâthe government, the Labor Party and the Democratsâand I am sorry to think that Senator Harris does not see this as a measure that will improve the situation. It certainly will, in my view. </para><para>I will refer very briefly to the issues that Senator Harris raised, but I will first give a bit of an overview. Australia's existing international child support enforcement arrangements are designed to deal solely with court ordered maintenance, which is being gradually replaced in Australia by administrative assessments. New arrangements which apply to administrative assessments are desirable, and I think everybody would agree with that statement. The amendments made by the bill enable Australia to become a party to three international maintenance agreements, which extends the range of countries with which Australia has treaty arrangements, providing for the enforcement of Australian maintenance liabilities. These agreements will replace or complement existing arrangements for the enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. They oblige each country to provide in its laws for the recognition and enforcement of such liabilities. It is important to understand in that context that since we have been in governmentâand, once again, Senator Harris may not know thisâwe have changed the way in which treaties are dealt with in the constitutional process. In my view, it has been a considerable improvement that treaties now have to come before the parliament. They have to be endorsed, there has to be a consultative process with the states and territories and the committee of the parliament scrutinises any treaty that Australia is looking at signing. So there has been a considerable improvement in that area.</para><para>I will now turn to the regulation making power which is inserted into the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1975. This allows regulations to be made prescribing, in relation to countries with which Australia has maintenance enforcement arrangements, all matters relevant to the recognition and enforcement of child support and spousal maintenance liabilities. Some of the matters for which the regulations may prescribe include: the enforcement of administrative assessments as well as the continued enforcement of court orders and registered agreements; allowing the Child Support Agency to make an administrative assessment even though the payer is not resident in Australia and does not have an Australian taxable income; in the case of New Zealand, providing that the creation and variation of liabilities will be able to be undertaken only in the country where the payee is resident; obliging each country to assist in locating payers, serving notices and providing advice so that maintenance liabilities can be enforced; allowing the Child Support Agency to collect overseas maintenance liabilities which have not first been registered in an Australian court under the Family Law Act 1975; and requiring reciprocity in legislative presumptions of parentage. If ever there were measures which go to the benefit of children, I would have thought, Senator Harris, that those measures are very directly related to the wellbeing of children. </para><para>I just want to speak briefly in reference to the Family Court and the Attorney-General. Senator Harris has spoken at some length about the Family Court and the Attorney-General, but I just draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we are debating Child Support Agency legislation here. It is not Attorney-General's legislation; it is from my portfolio. Maybe Senator Harris is not aware of the fact that the Child Support Agency has always had the ability to go to the Family Court to get an order where a payer has, for example, failed on repeated occasions to provide necessary information. Theoretically, a breach of that order could have resulted in a jail sentence, but I also point out that, during the whole history of the Child Support Agency, no-one has ever gone to jail. That is quite separate from the argument that it would appear Senator Harris has with the Attorney and his proposed changes to penalties in the Family Court for breach of orders. There has always been the ability to do that under the child support rules. </para><para>It is important that these facts be on the table, because if ever there was an area where there has been a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding it is the child support area. This is a scheme which Labor introduced but which this government has supported in opposition and has tried to improve in government. The child support area is an area where a great number of people who have gone through unhappy times in the break-up of their relationship transfer some of that unhappiness to their view of their treatment by the Child Support Agency, and I think that is unfair. Senator Harris mentioned Sheila Bird, a very senior adviser in the Child Support Agency. She has disputed claims of dishonesty and inflexibility. I think it is appropriate for me now to say that I believe that Sheila Bird is a fine officer. She has served the families of Australia well. She has been enthusiastically involved with this government in trying to implement reforms and improvements to the child support system and is very sympathetic to the needs of all parties in child support disputes. I would urge Senator Harris to think before he names a public official, as he did today when he named her.</para><para>I think it is perhaps best if we leave the rest of the debate to actually addressing the only amendments to the bill, which come from Senator Harris on behalf of the One Nation Party. The government will not be supporting any of the amendments and I would be happy, as the committee stage progresses, to give my reasons why.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>13638</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13638</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn moving my amendments to the <inline ref="R1012">Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>â</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hogg)</inline>âSenator Harris, are you moving them all together or are you moving them singly?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name></talker><para>âI will be moving them jointly in four lots.

I would like to go to the bill and to the proposed amendment to section 163B of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. The proposed section 163B says:</para><quote><para>The regulations may make provision for, and in relation to, the following matters: </para><para>(a) giving effect to an international agreement that relates to maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parentage or marriage; </para><para>(b) maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parentage or marriage, where:</para></quote><para>(i)	the maintenance is claimed by or on behalf of a person who is in a reciprocating jurisdiction; or </para><para>(ii)	the person from whom the maintenance is claimed is in a reciprocating jurisdiction. </para><para>The main problem I have with the bill as it stands is that there is no indication in that section of the bill of a provision that the international agreements are approved agreements by Australia. I believe that, if this bill is passed today in its present form, it will bring automatically into common law in Australia any international agreement in relation to the provision for family relationships, parenting or marriage. I believe that is far too open and far too wide for we as a Senate to consider and pass. The intention of my second amendment is to insert after `an' the word `approved', so that the bill itself then would give effect only to international agreements that had been approved within Australia.</para><para>I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the possibility, because of the subclauses under 163B, that the jurisdiction could actually be claimed in what is referred to there as a `reciprocating jurisdiction'. Nineteen countries within Europe are signatories to the Hague convention, which the government is proposing to endorse this month. The question that I would like to put to the minister is: how many of those countries have a legal system under which a person is guilty when charged and is required to prove their innocence? We have the total opposite to that legal system within Australia: an Australian is considered innocent until they are proven guilty. As to my reason for raising this issue, I do not intend to imply that there will be an enormous proliferation of these instances but, in my questioning of the minister's advisers in a briefing on this matter, they indicated that there were approximately 1,000 custodial parents who reside on a non-resident basis and approximately 8,000 payer parents who reside in non-residential areas, so it is possible for a custodial parent to obtain an order on an Australian citizen in a foreign court and then have that implemented in Australia.</para><para>If they are doing this as a result of the Hague convention, it has huge implications for this chamber if it passes this bill without there being an insertion that says that the international agreement must be approved by the Australian parliament. I believe that the people who are involved in this situation, undesirable as it is, through marriage break-up should provide for their children, but I believe that it is an impost on those parents, whether they are resident in Australia as a payer or resident overseas as a payer, to be subjected to this type of legislation under which they will have no redress under the provisions of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>13639</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI listened carefully, as best I was able, to Senator Harris, and I do think that here he is perhaps a bit misguided. The situation is, as I said in the second reading debate, that we have changed the arrangements in this place to involve the parliament about treaties. We are talking about future treaties, and this legislation refers to `maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parenting or marriage'. In other words, what we are talking about is a very narrow group of future treaties, if there are any. But they do not just relate to family relationship, parenting or marriage; they relate to maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parenting or marriage, so it narrows it down as to what such treaties would be about. We do not have them currently. Therefore, any that we were entering into would be entered into after the new process that this government has introduced has been gone through; namely, they would be considered by the Joint Committee on Treaties and they would be tabled in the parliament for a necessary period of time. Those are the sorts of things that did not happen before.  </para></talk.start><para>They will continue to be approved by the executive. That has always been the way. The Australian government represents the people of Australia in the treaty making power, but what has happened now is that the parliament is involved. The treaties committee was set up so as to have the parliament involved, and the laying on the table of a proposed treaty has the parliament involved as well. I would hope that Senator Harris's concerns would be mitigated to some degree by the new process for treaties but also because we are not talking about the wide spectrum of treaties that he was implying in his comments. It is simply related to maintenance obligations, and I think appropriately so, of course.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13640</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo the extent to which I was able to follow the argument that was mounted, or attempted to be mounted, by Senator Harris, I am afraid that I found no merit in the little bit I did understand.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13640</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCould I then ask the senator why under section 163B(1A) the government has not clearly indicated that it refers only to future international agreements?

The Australian Child Support Agency will help the payers living in Australia who are New Zealanders and who need to have access to New Zealand remedies. I am surprised or confusedâwhichever you likeâas to why you have any concern about the need for your amendment.

I did read that comment in the press at the weekend. I will check but, frankly, I am not aware of any commitments given along the lines outlined in the press. I also make the point that a second-hand car dealer will charge GST on the sale of a second-hand vehicle. However, they will also be able to claim input tax credits on cars purchased, so the net effect of the GST is really only on the dealer's margin. Input tax credits are available to GST registered dealers on cars purchased from both the registered sector and the unregistered sector, even though GST is not actually charged by the unregistered sector. Credits for cars purchased from the unregistered sector are deferred, that is, they are available when the car is sold and are used to offset the GST payable on supplies in the relevant tax period. These provisions, while different to the normal process of claiming input tax credits, should not greatly add to compliance costs, and I think that is the nub of the concerns that the MTAA have. As part of normal business practices, dealers would naturally distinguish between cars purchased from registered and unregistered persons and would keep records of the price of individual cars and track them in order to be aware of the margin associated with each car. Finally, deferring payment of input tax credits on unregistered purchasers ensures that there is no scope for tax evasion through falsifying records involving the unregistered sector. </para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13643</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question.

In other words, at no stage of the game did they show the slightest interest in any of these initiatives. Never once did they try and separate them out from the main Telstra legislation and have them voted on separately. They simply were not interested because they knew that this was in the interests of rural and regional Australia. They knew the money was not there otherwise, but they could not quite bring themselves to vote for privatisation when in opposition. In other words, the new election slogan is `Not till we get to government'. It is, `We will oppose everything in sight, but just wait and see. You know what our track record was on privatisation.

I urge my colleagues to press him, when he stands up after question time, to see what he will do in relation to the roll-back and whether he will give any assurances.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the specifics of the issue, GST-free bread includes plain bread, sesame seed or poppy seed rolls, cheese topped bread, pumpkin bread, plain focaccia, rye bread, tortillas, pita and a number of other items.

This is quite an interesting crunch issue for the Labor Party. Now that Senator Hogg has made this a special cause, I would urge the people in the bakery industry to make sure that they contact Senator Hogg to ask whether this is official Labor Party policy or not.

The Rural Transaction Centres program follows on from programs like those that Senator Alston just mentioned where we use the money from the sale of Telstra to do things for rural and regional Australia. Although the Labor Party opposed it tooth and nail, we were able to partly sell Telstra, to get the money in and, having got the money in, we are doing real things with it in rural and regional Australia.

In addition, 35 further applications for business planning assistance were announced. That brings to over 200 the communities in Australia that have been assisted by the Rural Transaction Centres program. The six new centres that were announced yesterday were approved following previous business planning assistance grants given to those communities. As a result of the business planning they have moved into the rural transaction centres. The large number of applications that we are receiving shows that there is a growing acceptance of the benefit these centres can give to rural and regional Australia, and of course the message is getting out there.

Aged care already makes a strong contribution to rural and remote Australia, with 28 per cent of all our places nationally funded in rural and remote areas. This will increase as the 40 per cent of the 1999 allocation which went to rural Australia comes on stream.

That does not for a moment stop him pursuing some procedural point on the basis of his longstanding knowledge of the way in which the party ought to operate. In many respects, it seems to me that it is a pretty important point to clarify because those participating in the discussions presumably did want to know where they stood on that issue, but that in no way means that they are likely to form a view one way or another.

Of course, since he made that statement, we have had another quality of service report released only a week or two back, which showed a quantum increase in quality of service outcomes. So, will that mean that Mr Smith will come out and say that we are making progress? Of course it will not. As we know, the very cynical and opportunistic approach of the Labor Party on this issue is to try to foster all sorts of half-truths and propaganda. But those who are interested in the facts will take the opportunity to put submissions to the inquiry; they will address what it is that they expect from telecommunication services; and they will look at some of the options that are available.

I think this is of great interest to the Australian peopleâmaybe not to the Labor Party. Tax reform is an essential element of continuing to ensure the ongoing prosperity of the Australian economy. As I have pointed out in this chamber many times, tax reform will reward Australian workers who have endured high rates of personal income tax for too long. It will provide, among other things, more choice for families about how they raise their children. The big feature of the tax reform package, as Senator Coonan knows, is the additional assistance which will be given to Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>From 1 July Australia will have a modern and fairer tax system. The government has put in place tax changes which will reform the indirect tax system, the personal income tax system, the family allowance system and the business tax system. These changes mean that Australian families will be better off. In fact, many families will be better off to the tune of $40 to $50 per week. On one side of politics, you have a government which is clear in its policies, which is prepared to get up and defend its policies and is prepared to explain its policies and, on the other side, you have what I could only describe as the politics of deceit. </para><para>It is very clear that the Labor Party have now signed on to the goods and services tax. They have signed on, despite all the debate in this chamber and despite, even today, people getting up and complaining about the GST. I wonder if the public know the Labor Party will be going to the next election with a GST policy. You would not believe it if you listened to them, and this is why I say this is the politics of deceit in spadefuls. They will be going quietly in this chamber in the hope that no-one will listen, but what they have indicated is that the GST will form a critical part of their tax policy. Sure, they have indicated that there will be some roll-back. Senator Hogg says he is going to roll back bakery products. Let him get up and confirm that. Senator Hogg is on record lock, stock and barrel on this issue and no doubt those in the bakery industry will be listening very carefully. Senator Sherry, in a debate last week, indicated there were a number of areas that Senator Sherry wants to roll back. Let them get up and confirm that they will be doing this. </para><para>There is, I regret to say, one thing that the Australian people should be particularly aware of. The Labor Party refuses to guarantee the very substantial tax cuts that we are giving to incomes. As I said, many taxpayers, many Australian families, will be better off to the tune of $40 to $50 a week and when Labor Party members are asked to guarantee these tax cutsânot once, not twice but 20, 30 or maybe 40 times the Labor Party has been asked to guarantee these tax cutsânot one of them will guarantee them. So after question time today I hope that the Labor Party senators will stand up, will be honest with the Australian people and will confirm that they are indeed going to go to the next election with the GST and will indicate where the roll-back is. You raise these issues day after day. Let us see whether you have a policy or are like Daryl Melham.

In fact, I think Senator Hogg got it right last week when he described Senator Kemp as the Sergeant Schultz of the Liberal Party. `I know nothing; I know nothing'âthat is the continual position that Senator Kemp takes in respect of GST matters. We saw that well illustrated again today. Senator Hogg referred to yet another complexity and inefficiency of the GST which on this occasion was in respect of bakery products. For example, why does an uniced bun, a bun with raisins or a bun with sesame seeds or poppyseeds not attract a GST? Why does an iced bun, a bun with raisins and apple, or a bun with cracked wheat attract a GST? This particular example that has been raised highlights the dreadful inefficiency of the GST that has been delivered to this country by the Lees-Howard, Liberal-Democrats deal on the GST package.

Having been tripped up today on their issue of the last couple of weeks, the stolen generation and issues surrounding indigenous matters, by their spokesman, Mr Melham, they have had to resort to their scare campaign on the goods and services tax. We have had some remarks today from Senator Sherry regarding hot cross buns and confusion with regard to how the GST applies. Let me say just one thing to Senator Sherry: the proposed roll-back by his leader, Mr Beazley, will magnify the degree of complexity with the goods and services tax. At this stage we have a relatively simple new tax system with the implementation of the goods and services tax. It is a relatively simple system but certainly not as simple as it might have been.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âWhy did you accept it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>âWe accepted it because of the absolutely urgent need for tax reform. The GST that we have introduced, notwithstanding the changes that were made to it to win the support of the Democrats, is a much simpler and less complex system and a much more efficient system than the wholesale sales tax which it replaces from 1 July. Not only that, it delivers the benefit of some $12 billion worth of income tax cuts as well to supplement the simplification. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Those two key issuesâthe income tax cuts we are delivering and a simpler, more efficient tax systemâwill be destroyed by the Labor Party, if this country ever has the unfortunate experience of another Labor government, because of their proposed roll-back of the goods and services tax. That proposed roll-back means only two things. The first thing it means is an increase in income tax, because Mr Beazley has ruled out any diminution of the revenue that the state governments will obtain through the goods and services tax. He has also ruled out reduction of the budget surplus or moving the budget into deficit. Therefore, to retain the revenue required to meet those two obligations, there is only one further initiative, and that is increased income taxes. And that is what the Labor GST roll-back means: increased income taxes.</para><para>The second thing it means is much greater complexity in the tax system. When you start to roll back the goods and services tax, as we have found to the limited degree that it was rolled back to meet the Democrat demands, you do increase complexity. But the degree of complexity that we have now is nothing compared with the complexity that we will have under a Labor government that rolls back the GST much further. Those are the two significant points that need to be made in response to your remarks today, Senator Sherry: there will be increased income taxes and much greater complexity under Mr Beazley's proposed GST roll-back. Of course, that means an increase in compliance costs on the part of business and small business in particular. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âThey have got that in spades.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>âNo, they have not got that in spades because of the averaging provisions that this government and the tax office have sensibly introduced to overcome the degree of complexity caused by those Democrat amendments. We have acted to remove the complexity, to keep the system simple for small business, by introducing those averaging provisions. But you cannot extend those provisions across the sort of roll-back that you are going to propose.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Even within the Labor Party, these difficulties are recognised. Members of your own party, Senator Sherry, cannot agree on how this roll-back is going to occur. The member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, put forward the view that certain geographical areas ought to be exempt from the GST. He is not talking about rolling it back across certain items; he is talking about rolling it back in relation to certain geographical areas. What did your colleague the Labor member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, say about that? He said:</para><quote><para>Latham has written much that is innovative in each of these areas. His most recent proposal, however, is just plain loopy.</para></quote><para>That is what Kevin Rudd says about Mark Latham. Then Mark Latham responded to Mr Rudd, saying:</para><quote><para>As expected, Rudd has no suggestions of his own to assist the poor. As ever, rhetoric is easy in politics; change is hard. </para></quote><para>That is the disagreement we see within the Labor Party. The fact is, whether you analyse it yourself or look at what industry representatives or independent commentators have said, they clearly confirmed that any proposed roll-back of the goods and services tax would cause huge administrative complexity and erode the economic benefits of tax reform which are clear, which are needed and which are demonstrated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13659</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also want to take note of the answers given by Senator Kemp to a number of questions today in question time relating to the GST and the tax cuts.

It has been mentioned so often by senators on the other side that I was starting to wonder whether they wanted the roll-back to check out whether it had raisins in it, whether it was glazed and whether it had icing, and whether it was or was not GSTable. That is the amount of confusion there is in the industry that deals with these products in terms of this GST.</para></talk.start><para>However, one of the things which is true that Senator Kemp said today in response to a question is that the ALP were opposed to food being GST free. That is true; we were opposed to food being GST free. But what he did not say is that the ALP were opposed to the economy being GSTable. Our position was that the economy should not be subjected to GST, and we consistently opposed, in this chamber and in the other chamber, anything at all to do with the introduction of a goods and services tax. So, in that respect, Senator Kemp was being honest when he made that point in response to one of the questions.</para><para>In response to the question about the MTAA's position, he talked about the ALP practising the politics of deceit. What he did not say in response to that question was that Mr John Gallagher, a tax adviser to Senator Kemp, recently wrote back to the MTAA rejecting its concerns and claiming the motor vehicle industry would be a major winner from tax reform due to cheaper vehicles and cheaper petrolâa response rejected by the lobby group as obtuse.

That bloke who used to be the Treasurer for the Liberal Party. I think he is Prime Minister now. Didn't he say `never ever' before the election campaign in 1996? Wasn't that one of those famous core promises, which got reduced to a non-core promise and then got reduced to not a promise at all? Yes, I remember him saying that. I also remember him sitting in a four-wheel drive in Cairns in 1996 saying that cars would be cheaper by eight per cent when the GST was introducedâmotor vehicles would drop in price by eight per cent. I also recall the minister responsible for that industry saying at Senate estimates only a few weeks ago that, while the GST would force down the tax on cars, cars could be dearer after 1 July. It is a pretty strange calculation but it is, nevertheless, one of those rare moments of honesty you get from ministers when they are answering questions. I admit he was a bit flustered that morning: he was running late for estimates, he had just got off a plane. He probably did not get an opportunity to sit down and think about the spin he was going to put on questions that morning. It was an honest answer, because the industry has been saying that the price of cars will increase considerably after 1 July. In fact, you have been seeing in the current environment that many motor traders, car dealers and car companies are selling vehicles at a loss in order to maintain their market share until 1 July, when the new tax system is introduced. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Kemp also talked about tax reform for Australian workers, and Senator Chapman went on about the income tax cuts and how great they would be.

They have adopted it. They have said that they are going to roll back a few bits and pieces of itâmaybe so. But when I look at the l-a-w law tax cuts of Mr Keating not so long ago, I doubt very much whether Labor have really changed their spots. We do not really know on this side of the chamber, nor do the Australian people, precisely what you will do. I guess we can be forgiven for that, because you do not know what you will do either. That is a very precise position as far as the Labor Party are concerned not only on tax but also on virtually every policy position there is. I want to quote a few comments which I think are instructive from some of the more sensible people in the Labor Party. Bob McMullan on exports said: </para><quote><para>The GST overall should be good for exporters.</para></quote><para>Let me tell you how good it will be: it will take approximately $4.5 billion off the cost of our exporters doing business from this country.

If you people roll it back, you are going to make it even worse for Premier Bracks and for all the premiers around the country in dealing with their state commitments and responsibilities. I say to the people on the other side of this chamber that it is about time they looked at this on its merits.

I was going to come to the heart of a number of the issues he raised. Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, talked earlier about the politics of deceit. This government would know about the politics of deceit because in 1998, when it unveiled the tax package, it produced a glossy booklet to sell it. Then it produced a $20 million advertising campaign to sell it. Then it called an election, all within the period of five or six weeks, just to make sure that ordinary Australians did not get to have a good hard look at what they were being offered. If they had had a chance, as was unfolded last year during the Senate GST inquiry, they would have seen the balance of payments problems that are going to be caused, and are currently being caused, by wantonly throwing money into the economy, just as they are through these tax cuts. </para></talk.start><para>The government champions the tax cuts, but what does Mr Macfarlane say about the inflationary impact of the ANTS package? Nothing, because Mr Macfarlane knows that he cannot afford to utter these words: the GST and the package which this government is proposing are inflationary. Interest rates are going up in this country because, even though this government will not admit it, even though the Governor of the Reserve Bank will not admit it, the markets know that the GST-ANTS package is inflationary. Why won't this government reveal to us its inflation forecasts? It is really a simple question. If the Labor Party or any other political partyâthe Democratsâtried to produce a document that refused to give a detailed inflationary forecast, the markets would tear them to shreds, and that is what is happening to this government. Interest rates are on the rise. Don't think they have ended yet. The markets know that this government is conning ordinary Australians and that interest rates are going to go up again because of the GST and the inflationary impact that that will have. We have seen retail sales start to go down. We have seen small businesses talking about closing up and getting out because of the GST. But currently in this country we have, once again, an outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds with all of the advertising you see on the telly every night about the government's tax package. It is a big, glossy, `It's good for the country,' but don't mention the GST. Whatever you do in the $50 million-worth of ads this time, don't mention the GST. Don't tell the truth about what it is doing. </para><para>Last week, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> made it absolutely clear on the front page. My colleague Senator George Campbell has just detailed it. The purportedâand I repeat and stress `purported'âsavings that were to come from this package to ordinary, battling Australians have already vanishedâthat is, if you believed it in the first place. So when Senator Crane comes into this chamber and says, `Treat this package on its merits; over a quiet beer, you know you really support it,' I have news for Senator Crane: I have never supported it and I am not going to start now. This government has deceived the Australian public. It is bad for this country. It is bad for economic growth. It is bad for inflation. It is bad for unemployment. It is bad for interest rates. It is bad for small business. That is the truth of this tax package, and no amount of glossy advertising is going to hide that.

Even more extraordinary is its claim that this inquiry will be Senate-like. That is what Mr Anderson said a few days ago. As my colleague Senator Lees showed today, the government cannot demonstrate that this is at all like a Senate inquiry or that it is in any way independent. I want to dwell on some of the comments by Senator Alston about getting the facts. He says that he wants people to get on with their submissions so that the government can look at the true facts and that they will see very significantly improving servicesâin fact, a quantum increase in services. </para><para>I want to draw the Senate's attention to the last ACA performance indicators report, which showed anything but that. In the provision of new services against the CSG standard in urban areas with infrastructure, the total nationally is still only 90 per cent, and that has actually gone up in most areas. But, for instance, in the Northern Territory that has dropped from 84 per cent to 67 per cent, a 17 per cent drop. In South Australia, the drop in new services against the CSG in major rural areas is from over 80 per cent to 72 per cent. In the Northern Territory there has been an astounding drop from 65 per cent to 33 per cent. That is a 32 per cent drop. </para><para>Looking at the restoration of service and fault reporting, the figure nationally is still only 83 per cent. It is a marginal increase on the previous quarter but is still grossly inadequate. In my state, Victoria, it has dropped from 85 per cent to 82 per cent, in South Australia from 79 per cent to 78 per cent, in WA from 86 per cent to 79 per cent, and in the Northern Territory from 82 per cent to 65 per centâa massive 18 per cent drop. In rural areas we see another dropâin Victoria, from 86 per cent to 85 per cent and in the Northern Territory a massive drop from 84 per cent to 72 per cent. In remote areas, again, the Northern Territory still only has a 61 per cent performance against the CSG, in Victoria it is down to 86 per cent from 92 per cent, and so it goes. Whilst there have been some increases, you certainly could not say there has been an improvement across the board.</para><para>It is a classic case of the government hoping that this inquiry will cover up those poor performance standards so that it can persuade the Senate that it should sell Telstra. At the weekend we saw Mr Braithwaite, who has very close connections to the National Party. Senator Alston says that we expect people to all live in a monastery. We do not expect that, but we do expect persons on this panel to be at least some distance away from the coalition. Of course, Mr Braithwaite could never be described as being at a distance from the coalition; he is a former member of parliament for the National Party. At the weekend we saw him try desperately to stop the Queensland National Party from instructing its parliamentarians to vote against the sale of Telstra. Senator Boswell, being a Queensland senator, is the person he was most trying to protect. But he did fail, and we look forward to Senator Boswell crossing the floor. </para><para>Telstra's performance is still inadequate, and neither this inquiry nor any other will show otherwise, in my view. If it does show otherwise, I think we have a reason to suspect it. This inquiry will not be independent; it will not be open to scrutiny; there is no obligation to make the submissions public; there is no obligation to conduct hearings in public. Instead, we are being offered field trips and consultation, and we have no idea what that means. There is not even any obligation on the part of this panel to report publicly. It might deliver its reports straight to the minister, and they might find their way into the bin, never to be aired publicly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question

WoolPoll (or Stage One of the AWRAP reforms) enabled woolgrowers to vote on the future industry services they require and the level of wool tax they are prepared to invest in those services. WoolPoll 2000 preliminary results in a preferential ballot showed support (61 per cent) for a 2 per cent levy (currently 4 per cent) to fund mainly R&amp;D and innovation with no money for retail consumer marketing. Wool industry services are currently provided by AWRAP and its subsidiary The Woolmark Company. The poll outcome will assist the Government in identifying and developing the most appropriate structure to provide the services to Australian woolgrowers. This process will form an integral element of implementing the wool industry Future Directions Taskforce recommendations.</para><para>The bill would also amend the AWRAP Act to allow the Minister to vary the rate of wool tax having had regard for the views of woolgrowers in WoolPoll 2000. This would avoid the need for AWRAP having to duplicate the process with a formal wool tax ballot to set a rate for 2000-2001. Such an AWRAP ballot would be limited in the questions which can be put to growers, time consuming, expensive and confusing to growers following WoolPoll 2000. This amendment will also allow the Government to phase down the rate of wool levy, as appropriate given the WoolPoll outcome, in order to meet the costs of transition to a new entity or entities.</para><para>Reasons for Urgency</para><para>The proposed bill would allow the smooth transition into the second stage of wool industry reform resulting from the wool industry Future Directions Taskforce report; that is, the investigation of the most appropriate structure to provide the industry services identified by woolgrowers in WoolPoll 2000. The bill would also allow the Government to vary the rate of wool tax commencing as soon as 1 July 2000, which would not otherwise be readily done ahead of substantive legislative changes to implement any new structure from 1 January 2001.</para><para>While there is uncertainty over the future of the existing authority (AWRAP) which provides research and development and promotion services to the wool industry, it has an unsettling effect on the wool market at a time of continued low wool prices, despite a recent firming in the market.</para><para>Removing impediments to funding the process will allow a more timely response to the grower poll and help to provide certainty to the market more quickly than would otherwise be the case. Similarly, early reduction in the levy rate will provide confidence that reform will be implemented, and provide some earlier relief for woolgrowers.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hogg</inline>, to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senate notes that:</para><para>(a) it is 61 days since former Senator Parer resigned as a senator for the State of Queensland;</para><para>(b) the Queensland Liberal Party has said that it will not select a replacement for Senator Parer until 30 April 2000, another 20 days (a total of 81 days since Senator Parer's resignation);</para><para>(c) at the Queensland Liberal Party's request, the Queensland State Parliament will not be asked to appoint a replacement for Senator Parer until 16 May 2000 (a total of 97 days since Senator Parer's resignation);</para><para>(d) the day of swearing-in of the successor to Senator Parer would be 5 June 2000 at the earliest (a total of 117 days since Senator Parer's resignation); and</para><para>(e) the people of the State of Queensland have been denied their full Senate representation by the lethargy of the Queensland Liberal Party in appointing a successor to Senator Parer.</para></motion></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Withdrawal</title><page.no>13665</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13665</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting, on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee I now withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in my name for six sitting days after today, for disallowance of the Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 1999 No. 4. </para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>13666</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>13666</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move that the following delegated legislation be disallowed:</para></talk.start><quote><para>1.

The terms of provision 5.1.1 are very broad in their scope.  The provision commences by requiring the owner of a ship to provide `such arrangements, equipment, instructions and training as are necessary to ensure that work on board the ship is carried out in a safe manner.'  The failure to comply with this obligation is a criminal offence, but the scope of this provision appears to make it difficult for a shipowner to know whether he or she was complying with the law. </para><para>Provision 5.1.2 imposes a limited range of obligations on the master thereof.

This Note appears to be an attempt to give some legislative force to the <inline font-style="italic">Code of Safe Working Practice</inline>.

Furthermore, the <inline font-style="italic">Code</inline> is a document, which no member of the Parliament has seen, and which (presumably) is capable of being amended from time to time without any oversight from the Parliament.

That is, it may be committed even in the absence of intention, recklessness or carelessness on the part of the alleged offender.  While this is contrary to the normal practice of requiring a mental element in the imposition of criminal liability, new regulation 85 provides that a contravention of subregulation 84(1) is an `infringement notice offence', that is, it is one which is generally dealt with by an `on-the-spot-fine'.  The Committee understands that in such circumstances, it is standard practice to impose strict liability, and to limit the level of the maximum penalty to a modest amount, as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for the alleged offender not having the matter dealt with by a court.  However, in this instance, subregulation 84(1) creates the offence of giving a false or misleading answer to quarantine questions on an Incoming Passenger Card not only in respect of an answer given by an arriving passenger about him or herself, but also in respect of an answer given in relation to other persons.

We have been very careful not to devalue their importance by abusing them. In fact, we have moved only one motion of censure since losing office in March 1996, and it is quite significant that that censure motion was also directed at Senator Herron for his insensitivity in appointing a special auditor of ATSIC without proper prior consultation and for jeopardising funding for community development employment projects. That censure motion was successful, so I think it can be said in relation to censure by the Senate that Senator Herron already has form. And there is no difficulty in opening the case against Senator Herron. The difficulty, of course, will be in bringing the case to an end.</para><para>Senator Herron is not just a failure as minister for Aboriginal affairs; he is not just an embarrassment to the government. His words and actions over the past week have taken him to a higher level of disgrace. He now shares with the Prime Minister the responsibility for killing off any chance of reconciliation while the Howard government is in office. He has effectively shamed the Australian nation. And the government stance on the stolen generation has, in the words of the government's own handpicked Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Bill Jonas, brought reconciliation to a dead end. </para><para>The issues and challenges we face in rectifying the wrongs of the past and in allowing our nation to come to terms with its history require leadership and they require focus from the government. This has been sadly lacking. Even with the limited portfolio and ministerial responsibilities that have been left with Senator Herron, he has been an abject failure. Sadly, Senator Herron's failures have become failures of our nation. And we as a nation suffer because the issues that he as minister is dealing with are critical to all of us. The importance of the reconciliation process cannot be overstated. Most Australians understand what the government fails to comprehend. Most Australians understand because they have a heart; they want to deal honestly with Australia's history. And it is a fact that generations of Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families and placed in care for the sole purpose of assimilation. Credible researchers have estimated that between 45,000 and 55,000 children were removed from their families. And it is a fact that these practices were going on for many years, right up to the 1970s. It is a fact that it was government policy to Europeanise the indigenous people of this nation. It is a fact that these policies have had a disastrous effect on the lives and culture of many Aborigines, their families and communities. It is a painful chapter of our history, and it is one that we must come to terms with. </para><para>But both Senator Herron and Mr Howard have had the hide to deny the existence of the stolen generation. Senator Herron's submission to the Senate inquiry into the government's response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report attacks the term `stolen generation', and it attacks it relentlessly. According to his submission, `stolen generation' is `a simplistic concept', page 2; `simplistic terminology', page 4; `so called', page 4; `a falsely constructed past', page 5; `a rhetorical' phrase, page 18âamongst many other attempts at semantic denial. All through the submission Senator Herron tries to get away with the logic that because, as he alleges, the numbers are neither certain nor large enough, then it cannot be called a generation. And what a small-minded, pedantic, insensitive and insulting argument it is. What an insult to those people who suffered and continued to suffer as a consequence of the policies of forced assimilation.  </para><para>Since then, of course, Senator Herron has tried to weasel his way out of this David Irving-like rewriting of history. He has the gall to say, `The HREOC report does not employ the term âstolen generationâ.' And I quote him again: `âStolen generationâ does not appear in the HREOC report.' Indeed, Senator Herron's own submission baldly states, `Although not used in the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report, the term âstolenâ is now used interchangeably with the term âforcibly removedâ as used in the HREOC inquiry.' Senator Herron also says that the term `stolen generation' has been brought up after the report by the media and others. You are wrong about that, Senator Herron. You are just plain wrong about that. It was used in the report. You trivialise this important debate by trying to score such pathetic points. In fact, the term `stolen generation' appears 19 times in the HREOC report, and that is a fact. Senator Herron tried to weasel his way out of that one earlier, as you know, by saying on Thursday last, in answer to a question I asked:</para><quote><para>The words `stolen generation' appear many times in the report ... in relation to organisations that were formed called the `stolen generation ...' whatever the organisation might be. </para></quote><para>They are Senator Herron's words and, again, he is wrong. Anyone who cares to read the report will find that he is plain wrong on that point. There are at least seven references to the stolen generation in the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report that are not linked to any organisations. On this matter, Senator Herron, again you are wrong and again you have misled the Senate and the Australian public. Senator Herron has so much egg on his face nowadays that it is pretty hard to distinguish the bloke from the yolk. But, Senator Herron, again you have misled. I just cannot fathom the motives for producing this submission. Why did the minister and the government do it? During question time today and throughout the last few days of media interviews the minister produced no reason. There was no reason at all to explain why in one fell swoop the government has insulted the stolen generations and comprehensively undermined the reconciliation process in this country.</para><para>The submission canvasses past practices of assimilation as being `benign in intent', but at the same time it points the finger squarely at state governments and churches, all of whom have taken the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report on board and all of whom have apologised to Aborigines for these allegedly `benign' past practices. But Senator Herron's submission is not benign. It is poisonous. It poisons the goodwill needed to make progress in this country on reconciliation. The Labor Party makes no bones about our view that reconciliation is a threshold issue for our nation. As Tim Colebatch wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last Thursday:</para><quote><para>Achieving reconciliation between white and black Australia is one of the few first-order issues in Australian politics. It matters because Australia's self-respect and international standing depend on it righting the wrongs of the past. And it matters because, until there is reconciliation, we cannot leave that past behind us and move on into the better future that white and black Australians want.</para></quote><para>I agree wholeheartedly with that. It is a first order issue. It requires leadership and focus from Senator Herron and the government, but they give it neither. If any issue or any policy required mutual obligation, this one does. There is no question that the Aboriginal community and their leaders have shown sincerity, goodwill, and I think patience, with the reconciliation process. Yet, this is always thrown back in their faces by Senator Herron and Mr Howard. It has been thrown back in their faces with the disgraceful government submission to the Senate committee. The submission really shows Senator Herron's true colours on this issue. The government has embarked on a deliberate strategy: the government, and Senator Herron in particular, uses Aboriginal issues as a way to divide us rather than bring us together as a nation.</para><para>It is inconceivable that Senator Herron and the Prime Minister's office, who were involved in the drafting process for the submission, could have been unaware of the impact the submission would have on the Aboriginal community and the reconciliation process in this country. They are guilty of playing the basest form of wedge politics, and they are deserving of censure in the Senate. The wedge politics theory is, of course, supported by Mr Howard's record on Aboriginal affairs, reconciliation, states rights and race issues. John Howard has been prepared to override states rights on anything from the importation of Canadian salmon to euthanasia, but he will not lift a finger to stop black children being put in jail for trivial offences. This is the same John Howard who consistently opposed sanctions against the racist South African regime. It is the same John Howard who used to brush away concerns about the people of East Timor as being `an obsession of the political left'. </para><para>But John Howard's piece de resistance was his advocacy of race as a criterion of Australia's immigration policy. Who can forget that? Over that issue, you had the wets in the Liberal Party choosing to split ranks. In the 1980s, I suppose, the wets were actually small `l' Liberals. Now they are really just wimpsânothing more than a crumbling edge of a conservative government in this country. But you have a Prime Minister with a shameful record on these issues, and the role played by the Prime Minister's department in drafting Senator Herron's submission should, I think, come as no surprise to anybody in this chamber. Written by overzealous officials, the submission faithfully encapsulates the insensitive and pedantic views of the Prime Minister and his trusty lieutenant, Senator Herron, who happily signed off on a poisonous submission that he should have ordered to be shredded from the very start. He should have said, `Have another go; start again.'</para><para>Senator Herron so often likes to remind us that he visited 80 Aboriginal communities in his first two years as minister. That is good goingâ80 remote and rural Aboriginal communities. He says that he has sat down in the dirt and chewed the fat with those communities. I tell you now: he could not have listened when he went there. If he did, it went in one ear and out the other. Otherwise he would have known better than to put his name to that submission. He would have been aware of the pain and hurt that the submission would cause.</para><para>John Howard is the engineer who has designed the collapse of the reconciliation process. But Senator Herron has been his willing accomplice in the Senate as minister for Aboriginal affairs. I suppose he will probably say, `I was just following the orders of Mr Howard.' But that will not excuse Senator Herron's shameful approach on this issue, particularly his shameful approach to the stolen generation and the broader question of reconciliation, to which it is inextricably linked. Senator Herron's shortcomings as minister for Aboriginal affairs have, of course, been recognised by the Prime Minister. He relieved Senator Herron of the responsibility for native title. That was passed on to the Prime Minister's soul mate, Senator Minchin. Subsequently, Senator Herron was relieved of responsibility for reconciliation. That was passed on to Mr Ruddock, even though he has managed to torpedo the reconciliation problem with his own submission. Aboriginal education is, of course, a shared responsibility with the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Aboriginal housing is a shared responsibility with Senator Newman, and so it goes on.</para><para>Even though Senator Herron might be an eminent doctor, the Prime Minister will not give him responsibility for Aboriginal health. That is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Aged Care. It makes you wonder what the minister for Aboriginal affairs in this government actually does. At the very least, you would expect him to provide leadership on indigenous affairs. You would expect him to provide impetus and drive to indigenous programsâbut no, there is no leadership from Senator Herron. There is just a vacuum.</para><para>Where is Senator Herron on the issue of mandatory sentencing? Invisible. Where is he on the issue of an apology? To the extent that he does have anything to say, it is on the other side of the argument. Even when he is given the opportunity to show some leadership in repudiating the appalling comments of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory about Aboriginal interpreter services, he squibs that as well. As for driving indigenous programs, forget it. What a sorry record he has been responsible for.  </para><para>In December 1997, the Commonwealth committed $63 million to deal with the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report. Senator Herron's submission to the Senate inquiry states that this $63 million `reflected the overriding priority identified in the HREOC report itself for facilitating family reunion and addressing the enduring effects on the people concerned'. Let us have a look at what the government has doneâwhat Senator Herron has delivered in this area. A paper that was tabled in this chamber last Monday, titled <inline font-style="italic">Progress on Commonwealth initiatives in response to the Bringing them home report</inline>, gives an insight into how utterly hopeless Senator Herron has been in the discharge of his responsibilities as minister. The paper shows that a paltry proportion of the $63 million has been spent. I will give four examples of how miserly the government has been. Of $11.25 million committed to family reunions, only $3.738 million has been spent. Of the $17 million committed to training and support for counselling services, a pathetic $0.865 million has been spentâless than seven per cent of the total. Of the $16 million committed to providing the all-important counselling services, a miserly $1.712 million, or 10 per cent, has been spent. Of the $5.9 million committed to enhance indigenous family support and parenting programs, only $188,000 has been spentâless than three per cent. It is not surprising that you have got individuals who have been denied parental and family love and support, who have been denied education in their first language, who have been separated from their own culture, and who suffer social and psychological problems in later life. That is where that $63 million should have been directed. They needed that as a matter of urgency. They are not getting it, and the minister, Senator Herron, has got to accept absolute responsibility for that. </para><para>Despite such a pathetic record, Senator Herron seems to take to this task with relish; so much so that he has decided to enlighten us in question time with quotes from that dour and pessimistic 19th century philosopher, Schopenhauer. Senator Herron piously quoted from Schopenhauerâdidn't you?âabout truth passing through three stages and ultimately being accepted as self-evident. It is the second time, I note, that Schopenhauer has made it into the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the last 12 months. As recently as 11 August last year, Senator Len Harris used the exact same quote as Senator Herron in his maiden speech. That is where you found it, isn't it, Senator Herron? The One Nation senator used the same quote to describe his personal journey and other aspects of his life. There is no doubt, Senator Herron, that you could have knocked the One Nation senator down with a feather when he found that you, the minister for Aboriginal affairs in this government, were drawing on the same wellspring of inspiration as he had.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

Paradoxically, it gives me the opportunity to respond to the motion, and I am happy to do so.</para><para>I reject absolutely the terms of the motion. I can point to very significant achievements in this portfolio over the last four years. I was very gratified when the Prime Minister asked me to take on this most challenging portfolio. There is no doubt that it is a difficult one, but I have found the experience very rewarding. I have provided decisive and effective leadership that has set a new direction in indigenous affairsâa direction that is taking Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people away from crippling dependence on welfare to economic self-sufficiency and self-empowerment. I have been doing this consistently. In my first speech as minister, I set out the policy direction in my Lyons Forum speech. On that occasion, I said:</para><quote><para>Our aim ... is to promote and encourage indigenous progress away from handouts and welfare, towards general self-empowerment. </para><para>It is about looking at what can be achieved ... it is about setting realistic goals and working towards them ... it is about better understanding indigenous Australians and it is about involving indigenous Australians more fully in planning and developing their future.</para></quote><para>I do not believe in creating policy in a vacuum. I have been to hundreds of indigenous communities all over Australia, and I have listened to what it is that indigenous people want for themselves and for their children. And what they want, this government is delivering. They want decent housing, good education, meaningful work, adequate health facilities and a measure of control over their lives. They do not want handouts, and they do not want to be dependent on welfare.</para><para>In 1998 I issued the discussion paper `Removing the welfare shackles'. This paper looked at ways that indigenous business and investment programs could be used to generate further investment and greater wealth distribution to indigenous communities. I am also looking at how indigenous people can have more influence over their day-to-day lives. I want to see substantial devolution of decision making power away from central offices and out to the regions, and this is happening. This in no way diminishes the role of ATSIC, but makes it an even more effective advocate for indigenous people. I am pleased to confirm that I have a positive working relationship with the newly elected chair of ATSIC, and I look forward to a continuing productive partnership.</para><para>Last year I released, jointly with ATSIC, a discussion paper on regional autonomy which foreshadowed a process of consultation and the development of models relevant to regional and local needs. This approach has been endorsed by the ATSIC board. Currently a restructure is under way which will provide much more influence at the local level. This will result in more responsive and effective program delivery. This approach will be supported by the work that the Commonwealth Grants Commission is undertaking on a relative needs basis in indigenous communities. It is consistent with my determination that resources go to areas of greatest needâwhere they will make the most significant and sustained differences. In terms of making a real difference to indigenous people's lives, I have worked closely with ministerial colleagues who have responsibility for indigenous specific programs. </para><para>The Commonwealth government since 1996 have demonstrated a steadfast and practical commitment to improving the lives and prospects of indigenous Australians. We are fully aware that Australians of indigenous background as a whole represent the most disadvantaged group in our society, and we have been addressing the elements of that disadvantage. The government's approach has been to tackle the fundamentals of disadvantageâthe key priorities of health, education, employment and housingâand to encourage the active participation of indigenous Australians, in partnership with us, in building a better future for themselves. Not only do indigenous Australians have access to all mainstream Commonwealth government programs and servicesâas is their rightâbut the government have in addition committed the highest amount of funding on record, amounting in the current financial year to $2.2 billion, to targeted indigenous specific programs.</para><para>It is important to understand that such programs, which are aimed at the root causes of disadvantage, cannot be expected to produce instant improvements. The government's critics fail to recognise the complexity of the circumstances and needs of indigenous Australians, who, like all Australians, want a decent quality of life, reasonable access to government services, a fair go and support to build a better future for themselves and their children as fully participating members of our society. The Labor Party had 13 years of lost opportunity to make an impact, but it fundamentally failed to make any significant improvements. I am saddened that the Democrats are supporting Labor in this motion, because they obviously know more than the Labor Party on this. The Democrats were around when the Labor Party was in power, and it did nothing to support what I am proposing now.</para><para>I am pleased to be able to report that, in those fundamental areas which really make a difference to people, progress is being made. Despite the historically high unemployment rate for indigenous people, there have been signs of improvement in recent years. For example, the proportion of indigenous Australians employed in professional occupations has increased from 14 per cent in 1986 to 22 per cent in 1996; the number of indigenous students in vocational education and training has increased from 15,000 in 1990 to 45,000 in 1998, and the number enrolled in higher education tripled between 1988 and 1998.</para><para>The government is pursuing three broad strategies to improve employment prospects and outcomes for indigenous people: it is increasing the job skills and employment opportunities of indigenous Australians through a special indigenous employment policy announced in the last budget; it is promoting employment and business opportunities in remote area, for example tourism and mining; and it is encouraging the unemployed to undertake community work in return for income support through Community Development Employment Projects and for facilitating their move to mainstream employment. The new indigenous employment policy, worth about $115 million per year, incorporates three major elements: firstly, a new indigenous employment program of $50 million per year that includes flexible wage assistance for employers who provide full-time employment to disadvantaged indigenous job seekers and support for new apprenticeships and cadetships; secondly, an indigenous small business fund with funding of $11 million over three years to undertake programs in skills development, mentoring, networking and advisory services; and, thirdly, additional measures and funding to improve indigenous job-seekers' access to Job Network Services.</para><para>In relation to housing, there is evidence that, notwithstanding a 140 per cent increase in the recorded Aboriginal population since the 1976 census, there have been improvements in housing conditions. In the early 1970s, up to 20 per cent of indigenous families lived in improvised dwellingsâthat number is now less than three per cent. The 12,000 new housing units provided over the last decade is equivalent to 15 per cent of total indigenous dwellingsâthis is a significant outcome. The proportion of indigenous families who own or who are purchasing their own homes has increased from 24 per cent in 1976 to 33 per cent todayâindigenous housing now accounts for 20 per cent of total Commonwealth spending on public and community housing. </para><para>The Community Housing Infrastructure Program is the government's largest indigenous specific housing program. ATSIC manages this program, with funding for 1999-2000 reaching $261 million. In 1997-98 over 600 housing units were purchased or constructed, over 1,100 were renovated and a number of infrastructure projects, including sewerage, water, power and roads, were funded. CHIP includes the very successful Army-ATSIC-Health community assistance construction initiative, introduced by this government in 1996-97, with funding of $40 million over four years. So far, seven projects, spanning Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland, have been completed and the Army has provided new housing, upgrades of water services and reticulation systems, waste management and sewerage systems and transport infrastructure upgrades to some of our most needy communities in rural and remote Australia. Another major Commonwealth programs is the Aboriginal rental housing program which is a tied component of the Commonwealth-state housing agreements. This program has funding of $91 million annually, and in 1997-98 an estimated 500 houses were acquired with these funds. Around 60 per cent of the ARHP funded housing is managed by community organisations. In addition, the Commonwealth provides concessional home loan support through ATSICâabout $40 million per yearâand up to 400 loans are provided annually, and short-term accommodation for homeless indigenous people through the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program and through Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. The Torres Strait Regional Authority also has housing and infrastructure programs, totalling about $12 million in 1998-99.</para><para>I turn now to education. There is evidence of significant improvements in education for indigenous Australians over the past decade. The proportion of indigenous students who stay on at school through to final year has almost quadrupled in the last 20 yearsâfrom 8.6 per cent in 1976 to over 32 per cent in 1998. The proportion of indigenous people with post secondary school qualifications has increased from six per cent in 1976 to 13.6 per cent in 1996. The number of indigenous higher education students has gone from around 100 in the 1970s to over 8,000 today. The importance the government places on ensuring indigenous children get as good an education as possible can be seen in the government's National Indigenous English Literacy and Numeracy Strategy which was launched by the Prime Minister on 29 March this year. It will do this through working with parents and communities, enhancing performance and outcomes monitoring, addressing poor hearing and other health issues, lifting school attendance rates, training teachers and using flexible teaching methods. The strategy is an example of practical reconciliation amongst all Australians. The strategy is supported by a number of prominent indigenous identities, including Evelyn Scott, singer Jimmy Little, and footballers, Nicky Winmar, Byron Pickett, Cliff Lyons and Nathan Blacklock. </para><para>The strategy is consistent with Australia's top level education policy agreement, the 1999 National Goals for Schooling in Australia in the Twenty-First Century. This agreement has committed all ministers of education to the achievement of educational equality for indigenous Australians as an urgent national priority. The commitment of federal, state and territory governments to addressing disadvantage in indigenous education is also supported by the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. The goals of the policy are the improvement of indigenous people in decision making, equality of access to education, equity in participation and equitable and appropriate education outcomes. These goals are enshrined in legislation and supported by a range of programs, including a special Aboriginal study grants scheme to assist individual students, and special admission policies in tertiary institutions. The government has increased spending for improved educational outcomes for indigenous students by around $16.3 million in 1999-2000. All states and territories have agreed to identify performance improvement targets for reporting in 2004. This will facilitate the development of national reports in areas such as attendance, literacy, retention rates and indigenous employment. </para><para>I turn to health. Although Aboriginal health standards remain unsatisfactory, they have been improving. Indigenous infant mortality rates have been reduced since the 1970s from 20 times the non-indigenous rate to three to five times that rate. It is not perfect, but we are getting there. The prevalence of trachoma has been substantially reduced overall. Death rates from infectious and parasitic diseases are declining. Male death rates from cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, injury and homicide have been declining since the mid 1980s. The government has made indigenous health a priority focus since coming to office. The expenditure has increased 51 per cent in real terms since March 1996 and, by 2002-03, it will have increased by 62 per cent over that period. There are four broad components to the government's strategy: developing primary health care and infrastructure and resources; targeting risk factors and specific causes of disability, morbidity and mortality; improving the evidence base for health interventions; and improving communication with primary health care services, indigenous peoples and the general population.</para><para>There have been some key initiatives in the Commonwealth's practical efforts to improve indigenous health. The government has agreed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health framework agreements to improve planning and provision of health services with ATSIC, the Aboriginal community controlled health sector and the governments in each state and territory. In 1997 ministers for health agreed on a set of national performance indicators and targets for indigenous health, and now every government reports on progress made in Aboriginal health and provides data enabling national monitoring to occur. Under the auspices of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health framework agreements, state and federal governments are also addressing socioeconomic issues underlying the poor health status of indigenous peopleâfor example, through a new national framework that provides guidelines for the design, construction and maintenance of safe, healthy and sustainable housing.</para><para>I turn now to the apology and reconciliation, which Senator Faulkner spoke about. Both the Prime Minister and I, as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, have expressed our personal sorrow over the distress that past practices of family separation have caused to indigenous people. The government in August last year sponsored a historic motion of reconciliation in both houses of parliament which expressed deep and sincere regret that indigenous Australians suffered injustices due to the practices of past generations, which recognised that many indigenous people continue to suffer trauma and hurt as a result of those practices and which reaffirmed a wholehearted commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</para><para>Regarding the separated children inquiry, I have come in for concerted criticism in the last week because of my submission to the Senate inquiry into stolen children. I can only repeat that I am very sorry if people have been hurt and distressed by the reopening of these issues. It was certainly not of my doing, in that the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee asked for a report and I addressed the terms of reference of that inquiry. The government had nothing to do with composing those terms of reference. To sensibly and responsibly address the terms of reference requires an analysis of all aspects of the issue, including the question of the numbers. We developed our response to <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> in 1997 in line with HREOC's finding that family reunion was the most urgent need of separate people. We issued a major, dedicated package of initiatives, totalling $63 million, to address the consequences of past indigenous child separation practices, focussing on helping people to re-establish family links, supporting individuals and families through counselling and parenting programs and providing an avenue for those affected to record their experiences. </para><para>In relation to law and justice, I have always been very concerned about the disproportionate rate of incarceration of indigenous people. This concern resulted in my convening in 1997, of my own volition, a summit of state and territory ministersâthose responsible for justice, policing, correctional services and indigenous affairsâand indigenous representatives. Initiatives arising out of the summit included the development of indigenous justice strategies by the states and territories to reduce this over-representation. The Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which I am chairing this year, is committed to progressing these initiatives in cooperation with indigenous organisations. In the 1997-98 budget, $1.9 million was provided for pilot initiatives designed to improve long-term outcomes for young offenders, including half a million dollars specifically for indigenous young offenders. An evaluation of indigenous pilot projects found that the projects had a measurable impact on young offenders and at-risk young people and in the 1999-2000 budget the government committed a further $1 million over two years to fund similar young offenders diversionary programs.</para><para>I turn now to family violence, which is something that is so fundamental but seems to be totally unrecognised. There is a state of denial in the Australian communityâand particularly in the Labor Partyâabout family violence. As anybody who has visited the communitiesâas you have, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, and as I certainly have, and it has been a great privilege to do so over the last four yearsâwould know, the level of family violence in the communities is almost overwhelming. The Democrats in particular have taken no cognisance of this, although I can understand the Labor Party taking no cognisance of this.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator Lees</name></talker><para>âThat is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>âYou have the right of reply.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator Lees</name></talker><para>âBut it is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>âThe Democrats were there for the 13 years that the Labor Party was there, and when did they take the initiative on family violence? Serious levels of violence and abuse are becoming the norm in many indigenous communities and many women and children live in constant danger. I have been very concerned that we address this in an urgent and effective way. I therefore sought advice from indigenous community representatives and, with their assistance, developed a national strategy on indigenous family violence, which has since been endorsed by the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I did that. I have regard for that, as a badge of honour, but not for some political motion that will occur today. We will be trialing a coordinated whole-of-government approach in a number of communities around the country and, under my chairmanship, MCATSIA will be monitoring progress. I am very pleased to have the support of Senator Newman in addressing this issueâin my view, the most pressing issue in indigenous Australia. The most pressing issue in indigenous Australia today is family violenceâno questionâand I get emotional about it when I see those 13 years of wasted opportunity and that this has been going on for many, many years.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>âThat is a lot of bunkum.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I want it recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that Senator Bolkus says it is a lot of bunkum.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, what I said was that the minister's claimâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>âSenator Bolkus, are you rising on a point of order?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>âI rise on a point of order.

I note that, as Senator Herron was speaking, on a number of occasions he attacked us specifically, and I will respond to that as I move through the few notes that I have in front of me. I have worked with Senator Herron on a number of occasions, particularly in the community affairs committee on health issues, and I have found him to have a very thorough understanding of how the Australian health system worksâindeed, I respect his knowledge of that system. So on a number of points that I want to make I am even more disturbed about some of the answers that he has given to Senator Ridgeway over the last week or so.</para></talk.start><para>When we look at this portfolio, I simply cannot think of any other minister that is so constantly surrounded in controversy. There is no other minister in this government like that. While he says that everything, as he just described, has been done and while he believes he is working with the best of intentions towards what Aboriginal people are actually looking for, he is constantly surrounded by controversy. It is a difficult portfolio area, and one from which we often see much heated debate arising. When we go back to Mabo, I think most of us who were here in 1993 will remember the debates that went through to Christmas, and we remember the Wik debates. But here we haveâon issue after issue, time after time, from the beginning of this minister's responsibility for this portfolio and from his treatment of ATSIC onwardsâconstant controversy. I do not think, by any stretch of the imagination, he could say that the Aboriginal people of Australia believe anything like the glossy report that he just gave that went back, in many cases, 10 and more years into the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. It is very unusual for us to censure a minister in this place, and I remind Senator Herron that it was indeed he who was censured in this place the last time the Labor Party moved to do so. I think all of usâcertainly all of us on this side of the chamber and towards this end of the chamberâread with disbelief that executive summary in the government's submission to the inquiry into the stolen generation. I quote, and these are his words:</para><quote><para>There was never a generation of stolen children.</para></quote><para>Obviously the minister has said very clearly again today that he not just approved of the submission but in fact signed it off, so we can presume that this was no accident. These are specifically chosen words, and I think the key words come back to `generation' and `stolen'. So all we can put it down to is a major lack of understanding of the very people that he has stood up here again in this chamber today and said that he is actually representing. In fact, I think I would go even further and say that it is worse than that, because to have this statement leaping out at us from the executive summary demonstrates a complete lack of empathy and very poor judgment on the part of the minister. Perhaps there is a grain of truth in what some are saying, that this is indeed a calculated move by the government to set them apart, for particular political purposes of their own, from those in the community who are actually moving towards reconciliation.  </para><para>Given all that has happened since the first white settlers arrived some 200-plus years ago, since the first Europeans set foot permanently in this country, surely we owe it to indigenous Australians to listen to and to actually take note of what their priorities are and what their real concerns are. Surely we have a moral duty at least to support the process of reconciliation and to help all of us come to terms with our history. In particular, looking at the motion before us today, Aboriginal Australians deserve a minister who will present their case clearly and vigorously and actually stand up and represent them and their priorities. To suggest that this is all just a political stunt of some sort, that we should take politics out of this issue, is again not listening to what Aboriginal people are saying about what they see this minister's role as being. I think that primarily the hope for reconciliation now, if not dead altogether, is certainly moving in the wrong direction. If there is one person in this community who should be working actively for reconciliation, apart from Mr Ruddock, who has primary responsibility for that, it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I want to stress here that I do not believe that Aboriginal people deserve a minister who effectively denies the existence of generation after generation of Aboriginal people who were stolen systematically and separated systematically from their families. </para><para>It is not uncommon for people to simply switch off and try to ignore something that they are finding rather difficult and disturbing and which they wish would all go away. But it is a bit too easy to take comfort in these comments that we are hearing that this all happened in another era, it was all done generations ago by people who had no involvement with any of us, it was somebody else; that this whole issue now and the term itself are pretty simplistic; that the whole thing was really benign; and that people in those days did not really understand what they were doing and did not understand the ramifications. On that point in particular I want to pause for a moment, in the brief time I have, to quote from a report written in 1949 by Patrol Officer Evans, dated 23 December. It was written after his patrol took him to the Wave Hill and Timber Creek areas. I will read just one paragraph:</para><quote><para>The removal of the children from Wave Hill by MacRobertson Miller aircraft was accompanied by distressing scenes the like of which I wish never to experience again. The engines of the plane are not stopped at Wave Hill and the noise combined with the strangeness of an aircraft only accentuated the grief and fear of the children, resulting in near-hysteria in two of them. I am quite convinced that news of my action at Wave Hill preceded me to other stations, resulting in the children being taken away prior to my arrival.</para></quote><para>So for anyone to suggest that this was not done with full knowledge of the impact on the children and on their families is mistaken. </para><para>For those interested, that report goes on to recommend things like: children under four should not be taken, mothers should be permitted to accompany them so that they can actually see that their children are being looked after, et cetera. People understood the impact of this on Aboriginal people and Aboriginal families. This is within Senator Herron's time and I think the time of all of us in this place. This is not something that happened way back before any of us were here. Is it any wonder that Aboriginal people and those concerned with reconciliation are outraged about this minister's comments and his lack of understanding of the impact of what has happened generation after generation and, indeed, was still happening in the 1970s? He stands up here today and lists some of the government's spending in the area of Aboriginal affairs, about which we are very pleased. But it is not balanced by the full picture of spending on all Australians and it is not balanced with a look at many of the outcomes and indices that we should be using to see how successful we have been. And it is not balanced with many of this government's actions in areas such as Abstudy, which it has largely gutted.</para><para>I want to now turn to the questions relating to health, which disturb me, considering Senator Herron's knowledge of the health portfolio. Senator Ridgeway asked a very specific question of the minister last week on Commonwealth spending on primary health care. This is not a question that has come from nowhere. If you look at a statement from the AMA where they talk about the facts, you can see that they say: </para><quote><para>While our health system delivers world class health care in increasingly difficult circumstances, we should also consider the plight of indigenous Australians. While the health of the broader community goes from strength to strength, the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders remains at Third World standards.</para></quote><para>It goes on to look at the fact that we are so far behind nations such as New Zealand, Canada and the United States, where they have been able to reverse the trend and improve health outcomes for their communities and actually spend some real money on primary health care. After all, this was specifically what Senator Ridgeway's question was about. Again I quote from the AMA World Health Day release:</para><quote><para>We are not spending what is needed on primary health care for indigenous Australians. </para></quote><para>This is the Commonwealth's area of responsibility. Senator Ridgeway asked:</para><quote><para>Is it not the case that for every Medicare dollar spent on non-indigenous Australians only 27c is spent on indigenous people?</para></quote><para>What Senator Herron did is to refer to Dr Deeble and to really misconstrue his report and his comments about the level of health spending. He rolled everything in, Commonwealth and state expenditure, ignoring the primary care issue, and read selectively from page 13 of his Bancroft Oration. But, if you read on, in his own oration it says on page 13:</para><quote><para>Indigenous Australians received very little from the two largest Commonwealth programmes of Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Per person their benefits under Medicare were only 27 per cent of the average for non-indigenous people and only 22 per cent for prescribed drugs. Per capita levels of direct Commonwealth expenditure on indigenous people were 63 per cent of the per capita expenditure on all Australians.</para></quote><para>In other words, while Senator Herron stands up and gives us the good news, he does not balance it with what was in his own oration, which states clearly that, when you roll in everything that the Commonwealth spends on Aboriginal healthâall the Aboriginal medical services and all the specific programs designed for rural and remote Aboriginal peopleâyou still do not come up with the same level of spending that is being spent on average on all other Australians. So I say to Senator Herron: I am sure you have detailed knowledge of this issue, yet you are still not standing up for Aboriginal Australians and saying, `Yes, we know we're still a long way behind.' The figures show very clearly that we are a long way behind. Yes, the states are spending money on Aboriginal Australians, but that is the hospital end; that is the acute care end where people are seriously ill. What we should be doingâand we should learn from experiences in Canada, New Zealand and other countriesâis putting the money into primary health care. Again, I go back to the comments from the AMA:</para><quote><para>The current policy of incremental change brings incremental results.</para></quote><para>In other words, we need a Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who will stand up and say, `All the evidence in Australia and all the evidence overseas shows that we must really put some money into primary preventative health care for Aboriginal Australians.'</para><para>I will finish soon because I want to leave some time for two of my colleagues, Senator Woodley and Senator Ridgeway, on this particular issue. I am going to deal with one other matter, and that is the comments Senator Herron has made about his visits to Aboriginal communities, about what is being achieved there and about what their priorities are. I acknowledge that, and I think it is a very positive step for a minister for Aboriginal affairs to visit rural and remote communities. But I also have visited rural Aboriginal communities and I find a very different picture. I find people who do not believe that they are being adequately representedâpeople with a range of other priorities. The racism and lack of understanding that exist in the 1990s in places where those communities are part of a larger settlement are absolutely appalling. While the minister talks about the positives, I think he needs to step back when he goes to Aboriginal communities and to really listen to what is actually happening out there on the ground. </para><para>I will give you an example, which is a visit to Brewarrina in January 1995. I visited that town about a day after the Pastoral Protection Board decided, because a couple of sheep had been attacked, to kill all the dogs of the Aboriginal peopleâto simply poison them with 1080 poison. They went ahead and did that, including dogs that were on chains in the Aboriginal community. From memory, at least two children had to receive medical attention because of their contact with dogs who had been vomiting and also with baits. I was joined on that visit by a number of people from the AMA. We witnessed a very distressing scene at the local dump, because the bodies of the dogs had been taken out there and the children wanted to find their dogs. They had someone on the gate of the dump trying to stop the kids from going and looking for their dogs.</para><para>We then went out to talk to the local community, which is out to one side of the town, to find that the community at that point in time was being sprayed by raw sewage that the local farmer was distributing over his paddock. It just happened that the wind was drifting that way and that the community was being sprayed with a mix of raw sewage. To give the impression, as Senator Herron has done today, that all is well, that everything is going swimmingly and that, if we just tackle this specific problem and that specific problem, it will be fine is not good enough. We have to listen to the people. We have to listen to their immediate concerns. We have to be aware and have some understanding of the enormous pressures many of these communities are still under. </para><para>I do not understand how Senator Herron can think he is consulting and listening. There are so many instances where communities are literally coming apart at the seams. Of course domestic violence is an issue. But there are so many broader problems, so many issues, that go to the very heart of our relationship with Aboriginal peopleâissues such as the stolen generations. So I say to the minister: on whatever issue we look at, whether it is mandatory sentencing, the state native title regimes that are coming through with virtually no word from the minister at all or specific issues relating to community after community, we need a minister who is going to stand up and be an advocate on behalf of Aboriginal people. We need a minister who is going to give them the sense that somebody is listening and that a person in charge is going to make a difference to their lives, not someone who is going to put a few dollars here and there or put in another army project to try to convince everybody that all is well. Hopefully, in the weeks and months to come, if this minister is to stay in this portfolio area, we will see a change of heart, a change of priorities and a real move towards listening to and working with Aboriginal people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>13683</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to support this motion before the Senate. It is the view of many Australians that this minister's actions have failed this nation and that for this he should be sacked. It is their view that his actions have failed indigenous Australians and that for this also he should be sacked. It is their view that this minister's actions have failed the test of competence and that for this failure also he should be sacked. At the end of some four years in office, the record of this minister is one of neglect, incompetence and national embarrassment. At the end of the last 10 days, we find the vital reconciliation process shipwrecked or at a `dead end', to quote the government's own Social Justice Commissioner, and we find our First Australians suffering a hurt to which they should never have been subjectedâa hurt directly emanating from a cynical rejection of their real history and of their suffering, a hurt directly caused by the government of this country.</para></talk.start><para>This minister's portfolio is a sensitive one. He has responsibility for the most dispossessed in our society. The issues facing this portfolio go to the most fundamental of issues facing this nation: its definition. They are issues which affect how the rest of the world sees us and they are issues which dictate whether we are divided or united. In all these responsibilities, the minister has failed. We should take on board the fact that the damage he has caused will take years, if not decades, to correct. Remember, we still have not shrugged off, some 20 to 30 years later, the impact of the white Australia policy on our international image. Let us not be naÃ¯ve as to what has been going on here when we approach this resolution. At all times in his missions, this minister's co-conspirator has been the Prime Ministerâa Prime Minister who lends encouragement to this minister's agenda, a Prime Minister whose tolerance of the voices of racism and hate has long been chronicled, a Prime Minister whose rejection of the validity of the claims of the stolen generation is well known, a Prime Minister who cares not if the rest of the world sees Australia as a country which discriminates racially, a Prime Minister whose international profile develops daily in the image of Ian Smith and whose image continues to damage how the rest of the world sees Australia, and a Prime Minister who says that saying sorry is a human response but cannot find it in his heart to be human to the stolen generations.  </para><para>This is a censure which, in many ways, we were always going to have, for the minister's record in this portfolio has made it inevitable. The Howard government was hardly sworn in and the ink on the oaths of allegiance was hardly dry when Senator Herron took his first swipe at indigenous Australians. Right from the start he used that old dog whistle. Its pitch was heard very clearly by those to whom he was really trying to appeal: the Hanson voters. On 10 April 1996, the minister confirmed what every Hanson voter wanted to hear: indigenous grantees of public money were not `fit and proper persons'. He announced the appointment of a special auditor toâas he might have said at the timeâweed them out. Right from the start, he bungled it. The audit was found to be invalid by the Federal Court and ultimately the auditor found that over 95 per cent of recipients were cleared for further funding. Most of their mistakes were technical in nature. The establishment of the audit was well publicised by this minister because that was what Hanson voters wanted to hear, but the results were not, for they told those very same voters something that their prejudices could not accept. So much for care for this constituency.</para><para>Then it went from bad to worse. In 1996, we saw some $470 million budget cuts to ATSIC over some four yearsâemployment, training, youth affairs and housing were hardest hit. In 1998, we saw ATSIC expressing a no-confidence motion in their minister, a view which they held for some 12 months, if not more. In 1998, we also saw the minister introducing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill, a bill which turned out to be beyond the pale even for this government and had to be radically reviewed. And 1998 also saw this minister in a full-frontal attack on the Kimberly Land Council, and then embarrassed because his facts were wrong, and a later attack on Australia's Aboriginal leadership, a leadership which is rightly respected worldwide but is vilified at home by this minister and this government. But it is not only non-government members who have been concerned with the minister's competence. The big issues in indigenous affairs for this nation have been social policy, native title and reconciliation. It is with these issues that the Prime Minister's real assessment of this minister has been made clear for, in giving responsibility for these issues to other ministers, the Prime Minister has said very loudly and unequivocally that this minister is not up to the job; that he is not competent enough to handle the main issues affecting indigenous Australians; and that housing, education, employment, as well as native title and the reconciliation process are better handled by other ministers. That view is something, obviously, with which I concur and with which the opposition concurs.</para><para>However, nowhere is the cynicism, incompetence and offensiveness of Senator Herron and of this government more evident than in the handling of the stolen generations report and in the submission the minister produced to the Senate committee just over a week ago. The government was handed this HREOC report in early 1997. In March 1998, one year later, when Sir Ronald Wilson, the Chairman of HREOC at the time, wanted to meet the minister to discuss the implementation of what was a crucial report, and the monitoring of that implementation, the minister refused to meet with Sir Ronald Wilson. In fact, the chief of staff of the minister's office wrote to Sir Ronald's office stating that `there was no reason to meet to discuss', that `arrangements are already in place' to monitor implementation, that it was `too early to say if the existing process required supplementation' and that `the ministerial council will be providing intergovernmental coordination mechanisms as required'. That was the response that Sir Ronald got. </para><para>Some 12 months later, in the estimates process, we asked the minister what the state of play was. We asked the minister what measures were in place to ensure the monitoring of the implementation of the response to this national issue. It is fair to say that the minister had absolutely no idea. Some 12 months later, the evidence of the estimates committee shows that the minister could not remember whether Sir Ronald's project group requested a meeting with him. He could not remember whether he had in fact met with Sir Ronald to discuss the preparation of a follow-up report. The minister also made it very clear that he was not involved in the decision as to who would monitor the implementation response, whether it would be the Commonwealth or the state. He had no idea, and the record shows that he did not care that he had no idea. What was even more worrying for those interested in the issue was that Mr Vaughan, Senator Herron's most trusted senior bureaucrat in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, a person whose responsibility, as it appeared in that Senate transcript, was to do the thinking for the minister, also had no idea as to some critical factors in terms of monitoring and implementation of this HREOC report. Mr Vaughan had no idea who chaired the monitoring committee or whether the committee had met. He indicated that the Commonwealth expressed no interest in chairing such a vital response committee. He said that the minister was not even consulted as to whether the Commonwealth should share it and that, as we saw from the evidence, the minister did not care to be involved. He told us that ATSIC was not consulted and the record also shows that Mr Vaughan and the minister had no idea as to not only who chaired the committee but who composed it.</para><para>The committee was set up in August 1998, and the estimates of which I speak were on 2 June 1999. Some 10 months later, this committee, charged with the most critical implementational response to the plight of the stolen generations, had not met. Not only had it not met; the federal minister with responsibility for the area did not know whether it had met and did not care to know. We have further established that, even though the monitoring committee had not met, there had been no action by the Commonwealth to force a meeting. We discovered that no resources were allocated to the committee and that the Commonwealth did not know how many peopleâif anyâwere involved in preparing a critical response and monitoring it. There was no interest, no concern and no compassion. His portfolio was in autodrive, and the minister did not even care if it had left the parking bay or not. Little wonder we got the report that the minister released last week.</para><para>Some in the gallery say that the government's response was not an attempt to play wedge politics, because of the fall-out since its release. Some in the gallery say that wedge politics are more a US tactic and not one that would work in Australia. What nonsense, what naivety, what a cop-out. Why is it that, all too often in this country, we do not want to face the facts, especially when those facts can be uncomfortable? What sort of excuse is it for this government to say, `We could not have done itâjust look at the fall-out, look at the way this has panned out. How could we have left it to someone so incompetent to play wedge politics'? It is almost like you are hearing Senator Herron saying, `Don't hold me guilty of trying to kill somebody across the road, because all I did was shoot myself in the foot.'</para><para>At law, incompetence is no defence; in this situation, incompetence is no defence. Let us look at some of the relevant facts. This report was released by the minister's office after days of frustration with the Senate committee, which would not release it. This report was cleared by the Prime Minister's office. Despite the Prime Minister's evasiveness about the basic elements of the reportâhe said he had not seen it before it was leaked to the pressâthe fact is that the fundamental elements of this report were put to the Federal Court by the Commonwealth in the Cubillo and Gunner case. There was nothing new to the Prime Minister. All these elements had been cleared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Prime Minister's personal staff. This was also established in the estimates process. The Prime Minister knew what this minister's position was months earlier, and it is quite evasive of him to say that he had not seen the report when he knew what was in it. </para><para>To those who say that this government would not play wedge politics on race, let us remember the number of campaigns in the Northern Territory, let us remember the federal by-election campaign in Adelaide where a candidate had a spouse of Asian background, let us remember the 1996 election, and let us remember that all the Prime Minister's menâMr Textor, Mr Morris and Mr Minchinâhave all been playing this game for quite some years now. Australia is all the poorer for it. Let us also remember that this is the latest instalment of wedge politics, and let us also remember that it was the Prime Minister and Senator Minchin who, in the middle of the Wik debate, went public on television with dishonest maps of Australia trying to terrorise Australians into feeling that Aboriginals were about to take over the huge landmass of this country.</para><para>We have in this report a shabby, selective and offensive rewrite of history. The minister claims, for instance, that the term `stolen generation' does not appear in the report. It appears 19 times. He claims, on page 30, that children were removed for welfare considerations or where a parent consented but not otherwise. What a lie. The minister's greatest offence is his attempt to dismiss the practices of the past as being benign. In my speech when moving for the establishment of the Senate inquiry, I cited extracts from the minutes of the 1937 conference of Commonwealth and state Aboriginal authorities. I said of that conference that it met in April 1937 and that the Senate, in considering a resolution that goes to the exercise of Commonwealth responsibilities, should take time to consider some of what was said at that conference. Let us go back to that. These are motivating views which are quite critical to assessing what was driving policy at the time, but they are views that do not appear in the minister's submission to the Senate committee. Professor Cleland, the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Aborigines in South Australia, said:</para><quote><para>The number of half-castes in certain parts of Australia is increasing. ... This may be the start of a possible problem of the future. A very unfortunate situation would arise if a large half-caste population breeding within themselves, eventually arose in any of the Australian states.</para></quote><para>Mr Neville from Western Australia said:</para><quote><para>In order that the existing state of affairs in Western Australia shall continue, and in order to prevent those half-castes who are nearly white from returning to the black, the state parliament has enacted legislation including giving control over the marriage of half-castes.</para></quote><para>Dr Cook, Chief Protector of Aborigines in the Northern Territory, took matters even further. Quite explicit in the fear he wished to share, he said:</para><quote><para>If Aborigines are protected physically and morally, before long there will be in the Northern Territory, a black race, already numbering about 19,000 and multiplying at a rate far in excess of that of the whites.</para><para>If we leave them alone, they will die, and we will have no problem, apart from the pangs of conscience that must attend the passing of a neglected race.</para><para>If, on the other hand, we protect them ... we shall raise another problem which may become a serious one from a national viewpoint, for we shall have in the Northern Territory, and possibly in north-western Australia also, a large black population which may drive out the white.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>The white population of the Northern Territory will be absorbed into the black. I suggest that we first decide what our ultimate objective should be, and then discuss means to that end.</para></quote><para>There were some other comments, and he stirred some of his colleagues. Mr Harkness, from the Aborigines Protection Board of New South Wales, said he was appalled by what Dr Cook had to say in the course of his very lucid speech. He went on to say:</para><quote><para>It is awful to think that the white race in the Northern Territory is liable to be submerged. ... There is an historic appeal in preserving a vanishing race, but I think we should seek to assimilate these people. </para></quote><para>On it went. These views from the policy planners of 1937 at a critical meeting at which the Commonwealth decided to fund the ensuing policy were not reflected in the minister's submission. They were whited out; they were written out. There is no one true recounting of history. I have tried to capture, by going through the statements, the very clear and unequivocal evidence that the fathers of the stolen generation policies and the supporting ideology and deliberate public deception that followed were not inspired by what Senator Herron calls lofty or misguided motives. They were driven, at least in part, by notions of racial superiority feeding racist fears. They consciously, or unconsciously, mirrored the same attitudes that were pervading the world through Nazism.</para><para>I could go on to quote more and more. Other people have done that. But the question has to be asked: why do these statements not appear in the government submission? They do not appear because the government submission essentially attempts to whitewash history. It is selective. It is biased. It is discriminatory. It is a despicable document of denial. This inaction, denial and historic revisionism of the Howard government provide the impetus for the resolution that we have before us today. This minister has sneered at the stories, disparaged the reports and punished the victims by his denial last week in the submission. Is it a blind refusal to accept the validity of these stories in that report or is it a refusal to read the informed research and enlightened works of contemporary historians? What is it that drives this minister? What is it that drives this Prime Minister? This minister's sins are manifold. It needs to be repeated that he has been incompetent in the conduct of his responsibilities. He has lacked real interest in the major issues of his portfolio. He has used his constituency for political purposes and by ineptness and malintent he has bungled a most critical area of public policy for reconciliation of this nationâall this at a most sensitive time in our history, at a time when the world's media are knocking on our doorstep to get an insight into this country.</para><para>We need to start again. One good way to start again would be to remove this minister. Another good way to start again would be to take the advice from one great Australian, one who may be vilified by this government but who is of international stature, Pat Dodson. His article in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Age</inline> I think presented an honest appraisal of the past, where he said:</para><quote><para>This was a place of power through guns and whips.</para></quote><para>He presented an honest appraisal of the effects of the past, when he said:</para><quote><para>There is not a single Aboriginal person who has not been affected by the consequences of these policies.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>It's a ripple effect, and it's not something that just happened in another time in the past. ... It has an impact right through us today ...</para></quote><para>He showed quite vividly in that article that these effects currently haunt people's lives. He said:</para><quote><para>You can see the problems in the children of members of the `stolen generation'. Parents can't answer their questions. Who am I? Who is my grandmother, my grandfather, my aunt or uncle? Generations of Aboriginal people have lost their identity, their sense of security. They're confused. They have no sense of where they belong.</para></quote><para>Pat Dodson also said:</para><quote><para>This is about people's lives. It is about families. To debate how many were literally affected at the time is not important. This has touched all of us, and it continues to do so. This is about restoring dignity to people's lives.</para></quote><para>This minister cannot understand that. He cannot understand that by not having that security, not having that context of belonging, not having that family history these people will be burdened and handicapped forever. This minister cannot understand that saying to them, `Sorry, you don't exist,' aggravates the hurting even more. Unless we understand this, we will not get it right. Unless we get it right as a nation, this nation will not be united in the way it should be. We cannot do this under this minister. He has to go.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>13687</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity to defend Senator Herron. Rarely have I heard such nonsense as I just have heard from Senator Bolkus, talking about the `objective' of Senator Herron being `to punish the victims'. There are very few ministers that I can recall in the 20 years that I have been in parliament who have been more decent, more genuine and more committed to their portfolio responsibilities than Senator Herron. </para></talk.start><para>Anyone looking fairly at the issue of indigenous affairs would understand that it is one of the most difficult areas of public policy and public administration. Being so difficult, it is often easy for it to be used for political purposes, as is apparently the objective of the Labor Party in this exercise. I think it would have come as a surprise to some Australians to have learned at the weekend that on many of these issues the Labor Party, while sounding so precious, does not even as yet have policy positions but simply says that if it comes to government it will then sit down and determine these positions. That demonstrates the opportunism of the Labor Party in this instance.</para><para>It is possible to debate aspects of history. I listened to Senator Bolkus talking about issues and attitudes of public policy in 1937. In my understanding of the history, there is no doubt that there were a range of motivations on the part of people who determined such policy and implemented such policy, whether on behalf of governments, the churches, communities or whatever. There is nothing illegitimate in having that debate. But if there is a contribution to it by the Aboriginal affairs minister, then that minister runs the risk of being made a target, as Senator Herron has been, by the Labor Party for its short-term political gains. I think that is a matter of some regret.</para><para>On this side of the chamber we have said on many occasions that we seek to understand the sense of loss of those who feel that they have in fact lost family, that they have lost culture, that they have lost language. We have acknowledged that it would never really be possible for us to fully understand the ramifications of that, not having been personally put in the situation. But it is easy to appreciate that there are those who feel a great sense of agony and loss as a result of that life experience. The constructive debate in this country is really about what we as policy makers and policy administrators can do in the future to provide a better opportunity for those who have suffered in this way.</para><para>We do that to a background where our record as parliaments and as public administrators in relation to indigenous people in this country has not been a particularly happy one. We inherited the legacy of 13 years of the Australian Labor Party that now lectures us in the way that we hear from Senator Bolkus today. Senator Bolkus does not start his debate by acknowledging that, after 13 years of Labor administration, life expectancy for Aboriginal people was 15 to 20 years less than for the general population. He does not acknowledge that infectious diseases were still 12 times higher than the Australian average. He does not acknowledge that indigenous infant mortality was more than three to five times higher than for other Australian children. He does not acknowledge that only 33 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children completed schooling, compared with a national average of 77 per cent. He does not acknowledge that 120 remote Aboriginal communities did not have an adequate water supply system; 134 communities lacked appropriate sewerage systems; 250 communities were without electricity; and 176 communities had unsealed roads. So despite all the glorious rhetoric of previous Labor ministers over the yearsâtheir claims and their boastsâin so many ways they have failed indigenous Australians. They have failed not only in relation to the statistics that I have just put before the chamber but also in perpetuating a handout mentality and welfare dependency that many indigenous people themselves wanted to change.</para><para>That is the background to which the Howard government came to office and to which the responsibility was given to Senator Herron, as minister, to lead in a different direction so that Aboriginal people could be given better hope for the future. We make no apologies for the fact that, as a government, we sought to concentrate on the areas of indigenous health, housing, employment, education and economic development as areas in which we could provide better outcomes for indigenous people, provide the framework within which indigenous people could achieve better outcomes in relation to their own aspirations. We make no apology for that at all. That is the direction that we took, which was different from the past, and we were prepared to be judged on outcomes in that regard. We have committed large sums of money to help us implement those programsâprograms that have been led by Senator Herron. I simply refer, again, to a record $2.2 billion being spent on indigenous specific programs during 1999-2000. Senator Herron, as minister, has had the responsibility for leading on these programs, for guiding the policy change and for presiding over the public administration. When you look at the areas such as I have just mentioned, already in a very short periodâthis is worth emphasisingâyou can see changes occurring and changes that will be for the benefit of indigenous people. </para><para>Expenditure on indigenous education programs under Senator Herron has increased by $16.3 million in the 1999-2000 yearâover $388 million in program funding. We recall the establishment of the National Indigenous Literacy and Numeracy Strategy launched by the Prime Minister on 29 March this year, only a few days ago. That is another example of practical reconciliation among all Australians. We recall the establishment of the National Indigenous Students School and also significant improvements in education for indigenous Australians. I give the example that in 1990 there were just 1,600 indigenous Australians attending university. Now there are almost 8,000. So something, I would have thought, is going right. It is just a matter of regret that Senator Bolkus is not prepared to acknowledge it.</para><para>Looking at the critically important area of education, there is a new $115 million Indigenous Employment Program which has an emphasis on private sector opportunities and support for indigenous small businessâa good initiative under the leadership of Senator Herron. Major features of the scheme include a strategy to encourage chief executive officers to recruit and train indigenous staff, private sector structured training and a national cadetship program for cadetships in the private sector. This is a practical solution and these are outcome based policies that the Labor Party would not understand but which Senator Herron, as Aboriginal affairs minister, has been prepared to lead upon to find new directions that can achieve better outcomes. There is an emphasis on apprenticeships and traineeships. I remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that when we came to office there were just 800 indigenous apprentices and trainees Australia-wide. Three years later this number had grown to 4,800. Something is being done right. But does Senator Herron get any credit for it? Certainly not from the Australian Labor Party. I also remind you of efforts in encouraging the unemployed to undertake community work in return for income support through the Community Development Employment Project scheme, facilitating their move to mainstream employment. In the area of employment there is hope for the future. Programs have been put in place that can give greater confidence to Aboriginal people that they are not necessarily going to have to suffer the disadvantage that they have suffered in that area in the past.</para><para>In relation to health, where Senator Herron has taken a particular interest, in 1999-2000 the government allocated $78.8 million over four years for improved access to primary health care through the Primary Health Care Access program. By 1999-2000, funding of $185.8 million annually will be allocated to indigenous specific health programsâa real increase of 20 per cent since 1998-99 and a real increase of 51 per cent since March 1996 when Senator Herron became the minister. By the year 2002-03 it will have increased 62 per cent. This is an enormous increase in real terms for which Senator Herron deserves credit. Madam Acting Deputy President, I also remind you of the landmark achievement in August 1997 when a set of 58 national performance indicators and key targets for indigenous health were agreed by Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers. Targets included a 20 per cent reduction over 10 years in both the overall death rate and the rate of comparison with non-indigenous deaths.</para><para>Extra funding provided in the 1996-97 budget over three years for the establishment of 35ânow 36ânew and expanded indigenous health services in rural and remote Australia deserves particular mention. In March 1997, the government committed $12 million over two years to programs to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. In the 1998-99 budget, $12.9 million over four years was announced for a new national indigenous pneumonia and influenza immunisation program. These are practical benefits for Aboriginal people brought about because of the leadership of Senator Herron, whom this Senate, through the ALP in particular, is attempting to censure today on his ministerial performance. </para><para>Moving on to the area of housing, in 1999-2000, $360 million will be spent on indigenous specific housing and infrastructure programs, comprising $260 million from ATSIC's community housing and infrastructure program, $91 million from the Aboriginal rental housing program and $8 million from the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Some might say `overdue'. That might be the case, but, at least under the leadership of Senator Herron, it is now actually being delivered. These programs provide for new housing and infrastructure, as well as ongoing management and maintenance of existing housing. They provide over 1,000 new homes annually. In 1997-98, over 600 housing units were purchased or constructed; over 1,100 renovated; and a number of infrastructure projects, including sewerage, water, power and roads, were funded. For that at least I am prepared to congratulate Senator Herron. </para><para>An extension of the very successful ATSIC Army community assistance programâof course lampooned by the ALPâwill provide $41.2 million over four years, thereby fulfilling the government's 1998 election commitment in <inline font-style="italic">Beyond welfare</inline>. This program provides basic infrastructure to remote communities, including fresh water, sewerage and housing, and provides training for indigenous people in the provision of such infrastructure and service. Our defence forces deserve particular recognition for the contribution that they have made in this regard, which I know has been appreciated by many indigenous Australians. So, in the area of housing, significant improvements are being made. There is still a lot of work yet to be done, but under the leadership of Senator Herronâon the basis of his record in such a short period of timeâone can have confidence that better outcomes will in fact be achieved.</para><para>In the area of law and justice there has been the formulation of a national strategy to combat indigenous family violenceâsomething that the Labor Party turned away from when they were in government because it was in the too-hard basket. Under the strategy, indigenous communities will propose locally based responses to be run at community and regional levels. The strategy will lead to the development of support services for victims of family violence and preventative programs for children and young people, as well as treatment programs for offenders. It will also examine ways of better regulating the supply and distribution of alcohol. Extra funding of $25 million in the 1999-2000 budget to Partnerships Against Domestic Violence initiatives brings total funding to $50 million. Indigenous family violence is a priority area under Senator Herron for new funding. </para><para>Continuing reform of the Aboriginal legal services includes ensuring that indigenous women have full access to legal representation. There is an additional $2 million, with a further $1 million in the 1999-2000 budget, for initiatives which specifically address violence, requiring greater performance reporting and monitoring, regular reviews, contestability and outsourcing in relation to the provision of legal services. Yes, it is a difficult area for reform; nonetheless, it is one that had to be tackled, and it is being tackled by Senator Herron. The development of measures of relative disadvantage by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to target resources more effectively to the areas of greatest needâ$3.2 million in the 1999-2000 budgetâalso fulfils a 1998 election commitment delivered under Senator Herron.</para><para>In moving on to employment and economic developmentâsomething also shunned by the Australian Labor Partyâhand-out was the formula and not to provide a framework within which indigenous Australians could build for their own economic future. Under Senator Herron, increased funding to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation has been possible. This facilitates and promotes joint ventures between industry and the CDC and indigenous people. The release of the discussion paper `Removing the welfare shackles' which outlines proposals for a new indigenous organisation, Indigenous Business Australia, to promote and participate in joint ventures with the private sector, to encourage job creation, to act as a conduit in accessing other government assistance, and to provide housing and business loans, grants and guarantees is another initiative in that regard. </para><para>If we look to the futureâa future under the able leadership of Senator Herronâwe see a government that will continue to address the health, housing, education and employment needs of indigenous Australians. We believe that there must be an equality of opportunity for all Australians, and it is a motivation strongly held by Senator Herron. The coalition, as I have indicated, is providing practical and responsible solutions to the urgent problems experienced by many indigenous Australians, particularly in remote areas. For the future, programs being implemented by Senator Herron will concentrate on greater involvement of indigenous communities at a local level in setting the priorities and needs of their area, aggressively pursuing improved health and housing outcomes, seeking solutions for the domestic violence problems that plague many communities, and encouraging self-sufficiency and employment through education and business opportunities. In a short period of time, Senator Herron has established a record that deserves credit. He has in place a program that is providing a new direction and a leadership that can give all Australians greater confidence that indigenous Australians are going to get a fair go in the future. He matches that with a plan that demonstrates exactly where he wants to take these programs in the future. </para><para>His record is one that I am certainly prepared to say I am proud of, and I very much regret the negative and carping attack that has been made by the ALP on him today. If the ALP, instead of promoting this new concept of wedge politics, put a bit more effort into a cooperative approach to indigenous affairs and for a first time indicated a willingness to work constructively with Senator Herron towards better outcomes, then all Australians, but in particular indigenous Australians, would gain by that. But to expect such a constructive approach from the ALP, a party that has, unfortunately, demonstrated that, through a lack of policies, it has no real or genuine interest in this issue other than to try to win a few short-term political points is, I regret to say, too much to expect. To that background, and the difficulty proposed by the carping and negative ALP, I commend Senator Herron for his leadership in this area and for his record to date as a very able and capable minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>13691</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor the record of the Senate, the Democrats want to say that we treat the censure of a senator as a measure of last resort, when all other procedural options have failed. I have sat here and listened to the comments made by Senator Herron and by many others about why he ought to be commended for various things. I take exception to the fact that many things are portrayed in the context of how much money is being spent and, perhaps, that the social decay that exists in indigenous communities and the moral evil that that presents for the entire nation is one for which indigenous people have themselves to blame. I think it also renders the whole idea of being able to say sorry or to apologise for comments in recent days as being most difficult.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Democrats have asked numerous questions regarding the minister's insensitive treatment of the stolen generations. I thought that it was necessary to move an urgency motion calling on the minister to acknowledge the existence of the stolen generations. That motion was successfully moved in the Senate. Yet since that day the minister has continued to show further insensitivity towards the stolen generations, and indeed towards all indigenous people. You cannot give an apology or inspire a particular outcome if that is always qualified. I think that, in defiance of the urgency motion, Minister Herron has in fact done nothing to ease the hurt and the trauma that indigenous peoples continue to feel as a consequence of past policies of separation.  </para><para>Many indigenous and non-indigenous Australians have told me that what he has done is exactly the oppositeâthat is, to add insult to existing injury. One message sent to me recently by a constituent, which was sent to all senators in this place, is relevant to demonstrate the damage that the minister's recent comments in relation to the stolen generations has done to all Australians. My constituent wrote:</para><quote><para>To my elected representatives,</para><para>I am finding it increasingly hard to hold my head up with pride and call myself Australian. I migrated here because I loved the freedom and tolerance of this multicultural country. Now I find myself in a country that no longer upholds these ideals, that is no longer a model to the world but becoming increasingly a pariah state.</para></quote><para>She went on to say many other things, but the most important point that she made was that `the government now refutes the notion of the stolen generation, the continuing pain felt by members of the stolen generation and the poverty and health and other problems of dislocation within indigenous communities across the country', all a result of the consequences of past practices of forcibly removing children from their parents and their subsequent mistreatment. She made the point that this all `defies belief', that somehow our minister and the government cannot accept what is plain to see. </para><para>The Australian Democrats have only ever sought to move two censure motion in the recent past, despite what was said by Senator Herron and others earlier. I ask that our support for this censure motion be seen in that light, despite the minister's comments. I also note that the minister is keeping par with the Australian Democrats on this issue. On two occasions the minister was up against two other censure motions: one in 1996, which passed the Senate. But these motions also questioned the minister's ability to represent indigenous Australians and were initiated because of the minister's attacks on the peak national organisation delivering services to indigenous communities, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</para><para>Does this sound familiar? I think this is not the first time that we are visiting the minister with this type of censure motion. His ability to represent indigenous people is again being questioned by the Senate. Again the minister has sought to blame ATSIC for his own failure to implement the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report. Over the last week, the minister has repeatedly demonstrated that he is not representative of indigenous Australians or their interests. It has also become self-evident that the term `stolen generations' is a mere phrase to the minister. He has been unmoved by the pleas for recognition and basic respect that were heard in this chamber on Thursday last week, when members of the stolen generations directly addressed the minister seeking for their identity to be affirmed by this government.</para><para>I do not believe that the minister appreciates that the label `stolen generations' is really a euphemism for the scarring and suffering still experienced by people who were forcibly removed, usually at a very young age, from their families and their country. What we need to understand most of all is that they lost everything that was familiar and reassuring to them, only to be thrust into utterly foreign surroundings. They were denied the love and the nurturing of families that many of us take for granted, and they were denied their culture, their language and their identity as indigenous people.</para><para>I cannot explain what it means to be a member of the stolen generations because I am not a member, but there are many hundreds of personal accounts contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report, and every single one of them is a poignant story of the human suffering that was so unnecessary and so damaging. They are the stories that need to be listened to, because they are about untold suffering, they are about lost opportunities for these people, and they are about emotional scarring and trauma. They provide a window into the depths of racism that indigenous people in this country have suffered generation after generation. Yet the minister seems to think that these primary accounts from those who were stolen, or those who saw their children being taken away, fail to demonstrate that entire generations of indigenous Australians have been affected and that several generations of indigenous children were stolen to disrupt, to sever indigenous cultures and languages, and to sever connections with families. Most of them were stolen because of the simple fact that they were either Aboriginal or part Aboriginal. No doubt you would have read in the papers on the weekend that a welfare officer made the point that children were taken even where there was no neglect.  </para><para>Until the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report in 1997, indigenous people in this country had borne the weight of their suffering in virtual silence, and the term `stolen children' was virtually unheard of in the community. But the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report provided some great things. It provided a vehicle by which people could tell their stories, it helped to change much of the silence of the past, and it helped to promote awareness and to bring about some compassion, not only from the people of Australia but from this government, where there had been ignorance and denial about the forced removal of children. I believe that there is no greater insult to indigenous Australians than to suggest that the existence of not just one but many generations of stolen children is factually incorrect.</para><para>I want to put a few things on the record. One person who has invested a great deal of effort into research of the stolen generations and their personal experiences is Dr Peter Read of the Australian National University. In response to the minister's assertions that the term `stolen generation' is a misnomer, Dr Read had the following to say:</para><quote><para>Generations? Yes, `Generations' because the first Aboriginal children were brought to the Native Institution at Parramatta in 1814. They did not come voluntarily. The numbers at the school were so low that in 1816 the Governor of the time sent out an expedition to capture 12 more children (and they only caught two).</para><para>Nearly two hundred years later, in the 1980s, children of failed mixed marriages were still being placed with the white parent by magistrates who believed that Aboriginal parents were somehow inferior to any other Australian. That's not one generation, that's eight.</para><para>In New South Wales in the 1950s the figure for child separation was about one in three. In the `problem' rural towns it was one in five. Along the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory from the 1920s to the 1960s the removal rate was close to <inline font-style="italic">ten out of ten</inline>.</para></quote><para>In response to the minister's refusal to use the term `stolen generation', Dr Read made the following comments:</para><quote><para>Stolen generations? Yes, `stolen' because of the more than 1,000 separated children whom I have been privileged to know and work with since the early 1980s, not one mother could be said to have given up her child voluntarily. Yes, many signed some kind of consent formâbut they signed under duress. To be told by the hospital matron, `You're a wicked, selfish girl, now sign this paper to give your baby to a white couple who will care for your baby much better than youâthat's not free choice!</para><para>To be told, `If you sign this paper we'll only take your eldest child, otherwise we'll take the lot'âthat's not free choice either!</para><para>To be told, `If you don't sign this form you'll be committed as a delinquent minor and the father of your baby will be charged with carnal knowledge'âthat's not free choice either!</para><para>The children were taken, signed paper or not.</para><para>Many of the parents asked to have their children back.</para><para>I don't know one who had their child returned to them.</para></quote><para>He went on to say many other things. What strikes me as perplexing about this issueâand I am appalled to say itâis that Australia now finds itself in the midst of a national debate about race relations in this country and under the microscope of the United Nations for the way we treat our indigenous people. I find it incredibly disheartening to see Australia unable to make a judgment between what is right and what is wrong and then to act on that conviction. It seems that every time we think that we're about to say something right, we must qualify that in some form. Disappointingly but predictably, the government's primary defence to the Australian community is the very tired justification of the amount of government spending on indigenous communities across the country.</para><para>I have to say one thing: that is prostituting figures for the very worst purposes, and I think Australians are increasingly suspicious and fed up when they hear the government suggest that everything is all right because money is being spent. So what? It really comes back to making the rhetoric match the action, and so far the minister's actions have failed. So too with this magical figure of $2 billion. When you look closely at that figure, it really comes down to understanding that it is about meeting specific indigenous programs that are substitute mainstream programs and trying to bridge the gap where services are not provided. Indigenous programs, not like others, are comparatively expensive, and you must take into account the fact that many people live in rural and remote communities.  </para><para>I think the fact needs to be mentioned that the minister's comments about the stolen generations were unnecessary. The government continues to say that its response in its submission to the Senate inquiry has been a factual one in response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>report. But the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report never mentioned the stolen generations. There was no reason for the submission to deliberately mention the stolen generations and somehow provoke a fight with indigenous people and the nation about what was right and wrong and what was decent behaviour. This unnecessary reopening of the wounds of the stolen generations, and the suggestion by the minister that somehow semantics rule out their right to refer to themselves as stolen generations, is simply not acceptable behaviour for the federal representative of indigenous people in this country. The stolen generations, let alone anyone else, should not be forced to once again relive their experiences in an effort to justify their identity to the minister who supposedly represents them.</para><para>I remind the minister of a letter that I believe he received last week from Dr Archie Barton. Dr Archie Barton was a foundation member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He himself is a member of the stolen generations and also is someone who has been recognised for his contribution to national life by the award of an Order of Australia Medal. His words summed up the message that I think most indigenous Australians would like to hear the minister say and to act upon. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, this is the minimum that indigenous Australians should expect from their government representative. Anything less is just not good enough. Dr Barton made the following comment:</para><quote><para>Any attempt to quibble with the term `stolen generation' diminishes your governmentânot those who were taken from their parents against their will. There is no doubt that some officials who took Aboriginal children from their families genuinely believed that they were acting in their best interests. However, time and the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing Them Home Report</inline> have not demonstrated forcefully that this was not the case.</para><para>Clearly, the important thing is for your government to show courage and leadership and have the decency to admit on behalf of previous Australian governments that these policies were wrong and caused much damage. Until your government does so and finds constructive ways to address the enormous grief and harm caused by previous governments, this issue will continue to fester.</para><para>I have previously indicated to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, that this is an issue on which Aboriginal people expect resolute and courageous leadership. This means that he must have the courage and generosity of spirit to admit that he has been wrong so far and to make an unqualified apology on behalf of the Australian Government.</para><para>In my view, the most important thing you could do for those many generations of Aboriginal people since colonisation who saw many of their children stolen, would be to induce your Prime Minister to show that leadership, and thus commence the healing process.</para></quote><para>I have to say that this comes down to a question of the authority being exercised by the minister, Senator John Herron. It seems to me, in the attempts to manipulate information to suit a particular outcome, that this is authority abused. Authority abused in this way does justify contempt, and it does incite in people the need to condemn the minister's comments. It is not good enough to continue to say to the nation that the moral evil within indigenous communities is the blame of Aboriginal people themselves. This is absolute abuse and manipulation of authority by a minister of this government.</para><para>It would be far simpler to acknowledge the stolen generations, but it must be done without saying one thing and thinking another. This just adds injury to hurt, and this is what has happened in the past few days. How can a minister or a government acknowledge the past and then somehow seek to acquit history? How can the minister try to acquit himself of recent comments? He cannot qualify what has been said. Such comments leave an indelible stain on national character as this nation undergoes further examination not just by the conscience of all Australians but by the United Nations. </para><para>I have always believed that much of the strength of any government relies upon good people within government, and it seems to me that this minister has failed his responsibilities. On three occasions he has been censured as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for having failed indigenous people and for having failed in his position. It is his responsibility to represent the interests of indigenous people to the government of the day. The minister has acted irresponsibly as the minister who is the representative of indigenous Australians. It seems to me that not too soon it might be time for the minister to consider bringing forward his retirement, because quite frankly indigenous Australians need someone that will represent them, not someone that will reprimand them for standing up for rights that are just and for rights about overcoming disadvantage, without feeling blame and without feeling that they are being told to be the victims of their own circumstances.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>13695</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a great pity that the minister was not here to hear Senator Ridgeway's contribution. When I look at this matter, I am troubled not just because of the indigenous point of view but that the apparent reality is that the minister believes in what he is doing and believes that it is the right course of action. Moreover, he believes that it has come about as a result of his consultations with the indigenous people of this country. While I do not see that as a neurosis, or a behaviour of that sort, there is certainly sublimation involved in thatâan inability to look at the reality that is in front of the minister. When he says to the chamber that the indigenous people that he has spoken to do not want handouts from welfareâthat they want power and a measure of control over their lawsâI say, `Well, who would not say that?' What does he mean by `a measure of control over their lives'? I ask the minister how he would feel if he were represented by somebody who said to him, `You can have a measure of control over your life.' It is way short of the mark. But that is what the minister said. He believes that indigenous people should have a certain amount of say in what they do and how they come and go, but on top of that need to have this paternalistic interference in their rights. I say to the minister: it is not until you recognise indigenous people as, firstly, equal and, secondly, as the first Australiansâwhich is beyond equalityâthat you will understand that your words are way short of the mark.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed, the comment about the most pressing issue in indigenous affairs these days being family violence was a come-on to say, `Who is going to challenge that?' Well, I do. The most pressing issue in indigenous affairs these days is empowerment: the return of pride, the return of culture, the return of landâthe things which will mean that indigenous people are returned their day in the sun. When they get that, you will start to see a turnaround of the internalisation of violence, despair and, indeed, jailings which are coming out of this government's policy and failure to understand that we have to meet our historic challenge to return real power, real rights and real control over affairs to the first Australians if we are going to see an amelioration, a rectification, of the at times harrowing outcomes of policies which fall short of that mark.</para><para>Finally, I measure the minister by the words of South Australian Governor Hindmarsh who, according to the book <inline font-style="italic">With the White People</inline> by Henry Reynolds, addressed the clans of indigenous people around Adelaide 150 years ago. Here is what Governor Hindmarsh had to say:</para><quote><para>Black Men,</para><para>We wish to make you happy. But you cannot be happy unless you imitate white men. Build huts, wear clothes, work and be useful.</para><para>Above all things you cannot be happy unless you love God who made heaven and earth and men and all things. </para><para>Love white men. Love other tribes of black men. Learn to speak English.</para></quote><para>Those words could come from the mouth of this minister in the year 2000. In fact, I would ask the minister whether there is any word, phrase or sentence in that invocation from Governor Hindmarsh with which he would not concur. Written into that exercise is why this minister is failing: he has not come to the recognition that Australians in general have come to which is that we need to change attitudes of 150 years ago.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>13696</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe policies which saw indigenous children taken from their parents in past generations were wrong. I want primarily to address two issues tonight: firstly, that the policies of the past were wrong and whether this government has really changed direction and repudiated those policies or whether it continues them. Secondly, I want to address the way in which those policies have fed the prejudice and racism in the general Australian population in the past and are feeding them now. </para></talk.start><para>What needs to be made very clear is that the majority of children who were taken from their parents were not taken because they were being mistreated or neglected, but as a direct consequence of the assimilative policies of the governments of the time. While the details of these policies differed between each of the states and territories to some extent, the assimilation of indigenous children was the aim in all Australian jurisdictions. As the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report notes from the very beginning:</para><quote><para>Government and missionaries targeted indigenous children for removal from their families. Their motives were to `inculcate European values and work habits in children.' Government officials theorised that by forcibly removing indigenous children from their families and sending them away from their communities to work for non-Indigenous people, this mixed descent population would over time `merge' with the non-Indigenous population.</para></quote><para>This was not a benign policy. This policy not only damaged Aboriginal families but also fed racist attitudes in the years before World War II and ever since. </para><para>One of the stolen children in her own research came across some resolutions of the Metropolitan Branch of the Women's Section of the United Country Party dated August 1934. I want to read into the record some of those resolutions to show you the attitude that people had to this very policy and the fact that there were white political parties that objected to the policy not because they had any concern for the Aboriginal people who were affected but because they had concern for themselves. I will read only some of the resolutions. They read: </para><motion><para>That, statements in the Press have been noted to the effect that the Federal Government is bringing to Melbourne from the Northern Territory, a number of Octoroon girls, with the avowed object of mingling them in marriage with the White Community.</para><para>That, further it is stated that these girls will be secretly domiciled in Melbourne, in order to preclude any knowledge of their ancestry being disclosed.</para><para>That, it is greatly to be deplored that the Federal Government is so far lost to the knowledge of our deep rooted sentiments and pride of race, as to attempt to infuse a strain of aboriginal blood into our coming generations.</para><para>That, the Women's Organisations of Australia be urged, that for the race heritage that is held in trust for the generations to come, for the sanctity of our age old traditions, and the protection of our growing boys, to combat with all their power this insidious attempt to mingle with the community, women of illegitimate birth, tainted with aboriginal blood ....</para></motion><para>I stop there because it gets worse, not better. These were resolutions of a political party in 1934. They were referred to one of the members for Melbourne and he referred them to the minister for the interior as serious resolutions. I do not know what the minister for the interior replied because I do not have the record any further than what I have told you.</para><para>These policies, designed towards assimilating indigenous Australians, were not confined to removing children from their parents. They included removing people from their land, putting them on welfare and resettling them in communities, which reinforced their dependency. The use of indigenous languages was discouraged and the practice of cultural activities was prevented; therefore, the preservation of culture became impossible. Senator Herron made reference to domestic violence and made a lot out of that whole issue. Let me tell him: it was the policies of governments in the past which created the problems that he was so careful to detail for us this afternoon.  </para><para>What needs to be stressed and recognised by all Australians is that the indigenous children who were removed from their parents because they were mistreated were in the minority. Likewise, it is important to acknowledge that, while some indigenous children taken from their parents under previous policies may believe they were better off as a resultâsuch as we saw on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program this weekâthese too are the exception rather than the rule. Past policies were at fault, and I note the minister's reference to the churches in one of the answers he gave last week. Sure, the churches were involved in this policy but let me say to the minister that it was 20 or 30 years ago that they abandoned these policies. What I want to know is whether or not this present government has abandoned those policies.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âDid you see the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âYes, I did.

Let me recognise Dr John Brown and the Reverend Jim Sweet of the Presbyterian Church. It was in the 1970s that the policy which they initiated, to return people to homelands, was opposed so vehemently by the Bjelke-Petersen government. I am amazed that this government has been unable to recognise what those policies have created or to recognise the link between those policies and what Senator Herron was telling us about domestic violence.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was really offended by his reference to the `fact' that the Democrats did nothing.

For 40 years we have been battling to try to enable Aboriginal people to have the kind of self-empowerment which would make the difference for them. In 1962 my first contact with the Aboriginal community in Mitchell turned my life around. In another answer last week Senator Herron referred to the actions of the Catholic Church. He spoke of the Catholic Church having made a statement of repentance and he had a go at Senator Faulkner when he said, `Perhaps Senator Faulkner doesn't understand what repentance is.' I have a feeling he does, but let me put on the record what repentance means. It means saying sorry and asking forgiveness. It means making restitution. It means changing direction because the way you have been going is wrong. If Senator Herron wanted to substitute `I repent' for `I am sorry' I would welcome that.

I wish to enter the debate of this very, very serious matter indeed. I do not think we should take lightly any motion that seeks to censure a minister. I certainly do not take this lightly and, from what I gather around the chamber, others have not taken this matter lightly either. Perception is a very important part of public policy. One could pass this whole debate off as a complete foul-up, and in a way it has been a foul-up, but it has hurt a lot of people. To deny that there was a stolen generation, as was the case in the submission by the governmentânot, by the way, prepared in the minister's officeâto one of our Senate committees, is a serious matter. As Senator Aden Ridgeway said, the taking away of children from their parents was not referred to at the time as the `stolen generation'. It was still an action that caused a lot of trauma, heartache and suffering. When the submission was made public and there was a denial that there was a stolen generation, it sparked a justified response which involved the outpouring of the hurt and the trauma felt by the children who were actually taken away from their parents. Those children had realised that they were being stolen. They knew inherently, deep within themselves, that their mother and/or father were the ones who were there to care for them and that under those circumstances they should not be taken away from them. </para></talk.start><para>As we know, much of this occurred in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. And, as we know, some of the policy makers at that particular time had quite overtly racist reasons for acting as they did. So we had a tremendous outpouring, of recent times, over this particular era. Of course, it came on top of the whole mandatory sentencing debate. I personally am very concerned that this issue be resolved as quickly as possible. I felt that, if the amendments that I moved to the legislation were adopted, isolating the matter at this particular time to the Northern Territory, and with the use of the territory powers to do that, not only would it have covered those persons who were not covered by the bill, namely the 18-year-olds, 19-year-olds and 20-year-olds, who I am informed were very much vulnerable to the mandatory sentencing policies of the Northern Territory, but it would also have been effective. Nobody can argue with the Commonwealth parliament's power on Aboriginal affairs. That matter certainly needs to be resolved. I also believe that the government should apologise and express sorrow for the practices of those who took young Aboriginal children away from their parents as a matter of course. I am not referring necessarily to those who were in danger. But, as we know, as a matter of course most of these children were not in danger, and therefore there was absolutely no right for the state to interfere in the rights of parents, no matter what colour the parents' skin was. </para><para>We have heard from the minister his expression of sorrow. I have listened very carefully to what the minister has said about this matter since it blew up a week or two ago. I believe that he has been expressing sorrow to those who have been affected. I wonder whether future governments will express sorrow for what is occurring at the present momentâthe stolen generations that are being taken at the moment. I hope they will. I refer to those young people who are so despondent as to commit suicide. I refer to the report of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Task Force on Violence, which shows the dreadful number of suicides amongst the Aboriginal population of Queensland. I will quote from the report:</para><quote><para>In Queensland, a recent study of suicides over six years from 1990 to 1995 shows Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males aged 15 to 24 have an extremely high suicide rate: 112.5 per 100,000 compared with 30.8 per 100,000 for Queensland youth generally.</para></quote><para>I can confirm what this report goes on to say because I know the concerns expressed by Aboriginal mothers at the effect that modern culture, if you like, is having on the family and particularly on the young people. There is a culture of absolute independence, that I owe nothing to anybody, not even my existence, and an attitude of materialism and acquisitiveness that is developing amongst Aboriginal young people. Of course, that is not only Aboriginal young people but young people generally throughout Australia. These are matters which we should take into account. I refer to the exploitation that takes place in Aboriginal communities by those who supply them with grog, with drugs and with videos. I read from page 100 of the report:</para><quote><para>Sexual abuse is an inadequate term for the incidence of horrific sexual offences committed against young boys and girls in a number of Community locations in Queensland over the last few years. Sexual violence offences are increasing, and may be related to negative male socialisation associated with the misuse of alcohol and other substances. Informants thought the accessibility of pornographic videos in some Communities was associated with some violent crimes. COD orders of $4,000-$5,000 worth of videos were reportedly coming into the Cape Communities. One Community with a history of pornographic video usage coincidentally has the highest rates of men imprisoned for sexual offences in Queensland. Factors such as family breakdown, child protection needs, juvenile offending patterns, early school dropout, youth suicide and misuse of alcohol and other substances were all linked to violence by informants. </para></quote><para>Are we responsible for a current stolen generation? I believe the time has come for us to stop accusing each other. Let us unite in a recommitment to the course of reconciliation. Let us also have the courage to express our deep sorrow for what has happened in the past.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>13699</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commence my contribution in reply by thanking the Australian Democrats and Senator Brown for their joint sponsorship of this motion of censure of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. I believe that the need to censure Senator Herron has been clear since the publication of his submission to the Senate legislation committee inquiry into the stolen generation. He, as a failed minister, should be brought to account. As minister for Aboriginal affairs, Senator Herron has been involved in a long-term strategy of driving a wedge of racism through the community. His government was caught out attempting to smother the United Nations report on mandatory sentencing that was requested by the opposition leader, Mr Beazley. Now, Senator Herron's own division within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been caught out corrupting the reconciliation polling process. Just today in question time, the minister, Senator Herron, had no answer for the fact that the bureaucrat in charge of the Office of Indigenous Policy demanded to insert his own questions on `special rights for Aborigines' into the phone-poll questionnaire carried out by Newspoll for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Let me make this clear: this has occurred within Senator Herron's own division of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</para></talk.start><para>I lodged a freedom of information application on the poll that was conducted for the reconciliation council and turned up a grubby thread through the paper trail which led to the inclusion in the polling of the question on special rights for Aborigines. The first assistant secretary of the Office of Indigenous Policy and the Prime Minister's own office knew full well that the public is susceptible to questions on special rights, be it on treaties, compensation or, in this case, special seats for Aborigines in parliament. It was a gratuitous question on an issue that has not really featured in the whole reconciliation debate. It is the old Mark Texter trickâa technique imported from the Northern Territory and the CLP in the Northern Territory. It is divisive and, frankly, it borders on push polling.</para><para>People who have been giving Prime Minister John Howard the benefit of the doubt as to whether he has embarked on a second term of racist wedge politics can no longer doubt it. Newspoll know how divisive these issues areâthat is why their report is careful to note that the `special rights for Aborigines' question was `included at the client's request'. They were obviously embarrassed about it. But it was more than a request; it was a demand. One draft questionnaire has the handwritten note on it, `The question on special rights MUST go in.' In the end, the Prime Minister's office got its own way despite the protest of the unit which serves the reconciliation council. The question on special rights was inserted into the quantitative polling, and it was asked of 1,300 Australians. A dirty great wedge has been driven into the results. If Senator Herron were a minister worth his salt, he would have put the kybosh on that polling and he would have reprimanded the bureaucrat involvedâbut, of course, he did not. He was in on the fix and, on that matter alone, the Senate is correct to censure Senator Herron.</para><para>Senators who have listened carefully to the government's defence of this censure motion would have heard a lengthy recitation from Senator Herron and Senator Hill of the government's programs in the area of indigenous affairs and expenditure under each of these programs. I heard a lot of reference to the term `practical reconciliation', a term I have no doubt we will hear much more about in the coming weeks as the government draws further and further away from the reconciliation proposals of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. To my mind, `practical reconciliation', a rhetorical term, is simply code for delivering to Aboriginal Australians the support and assistance to which they are entitled as Australian citizens. It is core business for any government. If reconciliation is to become a reality, much more than practical reconciliation will be needed. Sensitivity will be needed. The views of indigenous leaders will have to be heard and taken on board. Leadership will be required on issues that are of concern to the indigenous community. Leadership will be required to ensure that government programs actually deliver benefits on the ground to Aboriginal people. All of these ingredients are lacking under Senator Herron's administration of his ministerial responsibilities. He has displayed gross insensitivity on the most painful and sensitive issue for Aboriginal peopleâthat of the stolen generations. He has questioned, formally on behalf of the government, the very existence of the stolen generations. He has ignored the views of indigenous leaders. The government does not want to hear the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's prescriptions for reconciliation. It wants nothing of a deadline. It wants nothing of an apology. It is all too hard for the government and all too hard for Senator Herron. </para><para>What do we hear from Senator Herron on the issues of concern to the indigenous community? On mandatory sentencing, for example, silence; on an apology from the Prime Minister on behalf of the nation, nothingâand, in fact, he is being an apologist for John Howard's refusal to even contemplate this vital and necessary step. I do not really think he understands the significance of an apology to the Aboriginal people. I do not think he gets it. And as for driving indigenous programs, the facts speak for themselves. This minister has been asleep at the wheel. As I indicated in my earlier speech on this censure motion, he has managed to spend only $13 million of the $63 million which was allocated to programs to support the government's response to the stolen generations report back in December 1997. On every criteria, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, has been an abject failure. He deserves to be censured. I commend this censure motion to the Senate.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy PresidentâSenator S.M.

The committee supported all three of these proposed treaty actions. A number of other proposed treaty actions were tabled on 7 March 2000, but the committee has not been able to complete the review of these treaties. The Chairman of the Committee has advised the relevant ministers that we intend to complete our reviews and report on these treaties as soon as possible. </para><para>I would like to talk this evening about two of the treaty actions described in our report: the partial withdrawal of Australia's reservation to CEDAW and the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. When Australia originally ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983, the government of the day lodged a reservation which allowed the Australian Defence Force to exclude women from combat and combat related duties. This reservation reflected Australian policy and law at the time. By Australian law, `combat duties' are declared to be duties `requiring a person to commit, or to participate directly in the commission of, an act of violence against an adversary in time of war'. In effect, combat duties involve direct face-to-face fighting.</para><para>However, in 1992 Defence Force policy was changed to allow women to perform combat related duties. Women can now be employed in 85 per cent of all Defence Force jobs. Women can be employed as pilots and air crew in the Air Force, as helicopter pilots and field intelligence officers in the Army, and as marine engineers and all positions at sea in the Navy. The Navy now has its first female commanding officer of a ship, and women have been serving on warships for some time. All three of Australia's services have women pilots. It is only a matter of time before Australian women pilots emulate their American counterparts being in hostile combat. During the Gulf War, American women fighter pilots flew bombing missions over Iraq. Indeed, the first missile fired in anger from that American FA18 during Operation Desert Fox was launched by a woman pilot. Like the US armed forces, Australian defence policy still excludes women from situations which might involve face-to-face combat such as in armour, artillery, combat engineer and infantry units, as airfield defence guards in the RAAF and as clearance divers in the Navy.</para><para>It is interesting to note that even these barriers may be broken soon. The Defence Force is developing a competency based employment policy, as part of which employment decisions will be based on ability, not gender. This policy will be considered by the government over the next 12 months and if adopted will allow women to be employed in combat units if they have the necessary skills and ability. The Treaties Committee did not express a view on these broader employment questions as they were beyond our mandate. We did, however, support the withdrawal of that part of Australia's CEDAW reservation dealing with combat related duties. This action will ensure that Australia's treaty obligations are aligned with our current law and policy.</para><para>In this report, we also recommend that Australia accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. In recent years there has been an increasing number of attacks on United Nations and associated personnel deployed in United Nations operations. The aim of this convention is to deter violent acts against United Nations personnel by ensuring that those people who commit such crimes are brought to justice. As a nation, we have a proud record of supporting United Nations operations around the world. Australia's recent leadership of the international force in East Timor is a notable example of our commitment to United Nations objectives. People who work with or in association with the United Nations deserve as much protection as the organisation and the international community can provide. Although the convention will not guarantee protection for United Nations and associated personnel, it will help to deter violent acts. We believe that Australian support for this convention is a logical extension of Australia's commitment to United Nations operations. </para><para>We are also keen to see the protection afforded by this convention extended to include personnel working for non-government organisations providing humanitarian and development assistance outside the charter of the United Nations. There are many international humanitarian and aid projects which do not directly involve the United Nations. At present, the convention only covers those working for the United Nations or in support of United Nations sanctioned operations. We believe that the Australian government should take the lead in developing proposals to increase the protection available to non-United Nations humanitarian and aid workers.</para><para>For the 31st time in four years and for the 14th time in the last 13 months, I commend a report from the Treaties Committee to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13705</page.no><id.no>R992</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title><page.no>13705</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>13705</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the report of the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities on the provisions of the <inline ref="R992">Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000</inline> together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and submissions.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>âby leaveI move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>In accordance with the reference from the Senate, the committee's inquiry was limited to the actual provisions of the bill itself. The bill, of course, is only one element in the package of government responses to the employee entitlements question, and the committee itself may have initiated a wider ranging inquiry. Indeed, on the same day as the Senate referred the provisions of the bill to the committee, I circulated to members a much broader number of questions into which the committee could inquire. Nevertheless, the committee's inquiry produced a wide range of opinions, which are reflected in its report. The committee advertised for submissions immediately it received its reference and, despite a very short time span in which it was required to report, received 14 submissions from a variety of individual organisations. Because of the short time available, the committee could only hold one public hearing on the bill. However, our hearing was lengthy, with eight members questioning the witnesses. Two of the groups of witnesses each appeared for more than an hour, with all of the participants being given the fullest opportunity to express their different views.</para><para>In summary, the committee believes that it received the broadest possible variety of opinion on the bill and is grateful for the detailed and comprehensive submissions and evidence. The committee is confident that the report reflects fully the extent and diversity of those views. I thank the committee secretary, Mr David Creed, and his staff for their work on this inquiry and the report, particularly given the very short time frame that the committee had to deal with the matter of this bill. They worked assiduously, efficiently and competently in assisting me to conduct the inquiry and put the report together. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13705</page.no><id.no>R970</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>13705</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>13705</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Payne, I present an erratum to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="R970">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the erratum be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>13705</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>13705</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThe President has received a letter from a party leader seeking a variation to the membership of a committee. </para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><motion><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Finance and Public Administration References Committeeâ</para><para>Substitute member: Senator Faulkner to replace Senate Hutchins for the committee's inquiry into Australian Public Service employment matters on 14 April 2000</para><para>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation and References Committeesâ</para><para>Participating member: Senator Mackay.</para></motion></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT TO LAWS</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13706</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R996">Dairy Adjustment Levy (Customs) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R995">Dairy Adjustment Levy (Excise) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R997">Dairy Adjustment Levy (General) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R994">Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R958">Customs Legislation Amendment (Criminal Sanctions and Other Measures) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R742">Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline></para><para><inline ref="R1002">Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="R959">Gladstone Power Station Agreement (Repeal) Bill 1999</inline></para><para><inline ref="R779">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000</inline></para><para><inline ref="S194">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>13706</page.no><id.no>R1024</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>13706</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>13706</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>13706</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para>The speech read as followsâ</para><quote><para>Madam President, I am introducing a Bill to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974.

In speaking to the third group of amendments, which I have just moved, I refer to what are normally described as the Henry VIII clauses. The government's proposed amendments, as they stand, will allow for the regulations to have a greater head of power than the bill from which they derive their head of power. I will be asking a series of questions of Senator Newman towards the latter part of my remarks. The regulations will result from a departmental order to implement the act. When that is done, the regulations will come into the chamber and be laid on the table for a period within which any senator can move a disallowance motion. But the problem is that we cannot make any amendments to the regulations. The regulations may contain beneficial provisions, but if there is one section that we find unacceptable the only recourse that we have is the ability to disallow them. The regulations will be prepared by the department and it is this department that causes me great concern. We have not seen the details of the proposed regulations. How can this chamber, in all good conscience, pass a bill which directly impacts on the content of legislation with little or no ability to dispute it?</para><para>I refer to Senator Faulkner's earlier comments which included a pretence to not understand some of the points that I was making. Whether this represents an inability to grasp them or whether it is simply a lack of interest is not easy to determine. However, I am gratefulâas I am sure the Australian people areâto the senators who are highly informed for their input into the subject. Senators wax lyrical about deaths in custody and stolen generations and pour inappropriate scorn on Senator Herron, but they are indifferent to the deaths that are the result of decisions by the CSAâa suicide rate that is more than five times greater than that of indigenous Australians. It is a very serious problem that comes before the chamber, and senators should take a proper and reasonable interest in it.</para><para>I would now like to turn to the Henry VIII clauses and bring to the Senate's attention that the CSA is currently not bound by the rules of evidence. Indeed, CSA officers can, at their complete and unilateral discretion, create a case file which, once created, records information on a payee and a payer party without proof of evidence or corroboration. It cannot be that the government now wishes a domestic system such as this to now be exposed to the international arena. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> says:</para><quote><para>Since its establishment, the committee has consistently drawn attention to Henry VIII clauses. While the explanation put forward in this case for this bill may provide a justification for including these particular provisions, the committee nevertheless remains concerned wherever subordinate legislation takes precedence over the primary legislation that creates it.</para></quote><para>So the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also has concerns about this section of the regulation. </para><para>I would also like to quote from a section of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Family Law Child Support Handbook</inline> in which it says in section PD97/1: </para><quote><para>The purpose of a conference is to allow each party to fairly and properly present the case to the senior case officer in an informal manner so that the senior case officer gains maximum relevant information.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say under 4:</para><quote><para>The proceedings are not officially tape recorded and there is no statutory requirement that an official record be taken by the decision maker.</para></quote><para>I have concerns in relation to a communication from the Child Support Agency in which it states: </para><quote><para>The taping of changes of assessment hearings are not officially recorded, and private tape recording is specifically not permitted under practice direction PD97/1.

It goes on to say:</para><para>However, you may make your own inquiries through avenues such as local libraries.</para><para>The point I am raising is that Senator Newman, through the bill that she is introducing, is going to give to this same agency far greater powers, I believe, than they have at the present moment.</para><para>I would also like to raise a couple of cases and, in doing so, put on the record that a good deal of the information and content on the issues that I have brought forward today were also raised by John Stapleton in the focus section of one of the newspapers yesterday. Let me briefly relate to the chamber some of the decisions that this agency, which is going to be charged with the responsibility of writing these regulations, made. These are some case examples that relate to its other decisions. This case was filed with the CSA by a mother who nominated a payer fatherâand in this case it was her husbandâwho was at the time living at home with the family and paying all the bills. The mother declared that separation had actually taken place some nine months prior to lodging the claim. </para><para>With this information, which included only the mother's say-so and nothing else, the CSA Deputy Registrar took a position which deemed that not only did the father owe the relevant amount of child support but also he was already in default. To add to this deceit, the mother declared that her living-at-home husband was `whereabouts unknown'. So we have a situation in which the mother files the action and then lists the husband, who is residing in the same home, as `whereabouts unknown'. As a result, the CSA quietly accrued the debt against the father, who at no time had any knowledge that this was occurring. The CSA made no effort to investigate or verify the mother's claims and nor did it, in this instance, seek any proof. In addition to this important point, the CSA made no effort to contact the father.</para><para>I would like to put some questions to Senator Newman: is it responsible of the government to allow this agency to be involved to such a large degree in the development of regulations we have not even seen yet? I ask also whether, in the preparation of this bill, the department have made any provision for, or have they even assessed, the impacts on currency that may occur in relation to these regulations, because of changes in the exchange rate, when we have a payer who is a non-resident? Have the department assessed in any way the impacts of that? I would bring to the attention of the chamber some of the problems that the pastoral industry got into recently when applying for loans, et cetera, where they were caught not by the changes in interest rates but by the changes in the exchange rate. Senator Newman, how many times have these Henry VIII clauses, as we refer to them, been implemented previously in relation to legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13708</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will start and then get some more information for Senator Harris as I go on. I will just put on record what the history of this issue is. This bill we are debating tonight was intended to include the measures that are now going to be tabled as regulations. But, as most senators would recognise, there has been huge demands on the Office of Parliamentary Counsel over the last few months with the pressure of legislation, and they were unable to complete the work in time for a 1 July start-up for these measures. The problem was caused by an agreement between our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister. They had agreed that the new arrangements would start up on 1 July. </para></talk.start><para>In order to honour that commitment, Australia is bringing forward some of the details by way of regulation. However, we have made it clear that these measures will be tabled, and Senator Harris will be able to scrutinise them. But they will also be brought into the legislation later in the year. If he does not like them then, Senator Harris will have the opportunity when they come forward later in the year in amending legislation to debate the issue and to move amendments if he chooses. I think that is not an unreasonable way of proceeding in what is a very tight timeframe not for the government but for the legislative draftsmen and also for Australia's reputation in making agreements with heads of other governments.</para><para>I think it is a practical solution. Having been a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for a few years when I first came into the Senate, I am very familiar with the Henry VIII clause that Senator Harris read out. I can assure him that it is by no means unusual for the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to make that statement. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has quite regularly said just what you read out tonight, Senator Harris, but it does not mean to say that there is something dreadfully devious about taking the action we are proposing. These are special circumstances, it will be for a very short period, until the legislative draftsmen can get what will come forward as regulations into an amending bill later on this year. I would have thought that was not unreasonable at all. You will certainly have that opportunity later in the year to deal with them when they come forward as amendments. I would suggest that by that stage, if they have been introduced as regulations, you will have had an opportunity to see how they actually work as well. Once again, I think that is eminently reasonable, and I hope you would agree. In addition, I am advised that where an overseas orderâthis is in relation to a specific query you madeâis registered in Australia, the exchange rates at the time of registration apply. That is the existing law, and it will not change.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13709</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would just ask Senator Newman for clarification on that last pointâthat, when the order is initiated, there will be, I understand, a fixed rate of exchange.

The families in my area of the north-west coast of Tasmania represent a disproportionately large section of lower income recipients. There are many factors influencing this. Economic restructuring has often unintentionally resulted in what could be called a geographical void of economic activity and thus opportunity. Therefore, we have many families reliant on social securityâunskilled workers, low paid workers and seasonal and temporary workers. This often means that their incomes vary from week to week. As this does not fit nicely into the bureaucratically arrived at demands, they will be disadvantaged.</para></talk.start><para>These families are not in the position to assess their incomes in advance. At present, fee relief is based on income in the last completed tax year, but from 1 July this will have to be done for the year ahead, with no margin for error. How can those on the north-west coast who are low income earners or casual or part-time workers do this? On the north-west coast of Tasmania, a large proportion of the work is seasonal. This is directly related to a rural based economic structure, thus for those people with jobs such as picking and grading brussels sprouts, potatoes, onions, apples and pears, it is difficult to assess their incomes because there is no set hour. Many things can interfere with it. Often the amounts they earn are calculated by the amount picked or graded. Inclement weather can stop work, and so can the breakdown of machinery. All this can affect the income not only from week to week but from day to day, thus forward projections of income are impossible.</para><para>As their incomes are so variable, one could reasonably assume that, when the forward estimates of incomes starts, seasonal and casual workers are highly likely to be exposed to bureaucratic errors that could cause undue and unreasonable stress on them and their families. Currently 32 per cent of all family payments received have been found to be in error. This figure has arisen because something is wrong with the system. It has nothing to do with the honesty of Australian families. These numbers are most likely to increase because the workers concerned have no way of knowing how long their hours will be. Thus the most likely scenario for the many of the workers on the north-west coast of Tasmania will be a debt to Centrelinkâa present at tax time. Remember that this debt will be incurred due to ill-conceived bureaucratic demands that are unable or unwilling to take into account the needs of many of the workers in rural communitiesâso much for client centred services. </para><para>The government have, time and time again, campaigned on a family values platform. Surely one of the principal foundations of stability in an essentially capitalised based economy is a guaranteed access to capital. Many of us have heard accounts of families under real stress due to what amounts to a few dollars a week. Many of these families that I am speaking of in the area where I live really do live from week to week. They do have very basic incomes, they do not have permanent employment, and this causes a lot of concern for them. Will this mother be one of these mentioned on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> by Pam Cahir from the Early Childhood Association? Pam Cahir said:</para><quote><para>Some parents are being forced out of the workforce. We do know that. They don't want to be out of the workforce, they want to be in the workforce, but it costs too much and it's cheaper for them to cut back days and to stay at home.</para></quote><para>Some of the families in my area have cut back days and some of them have given up work because, firstly, they do not want to use backyard careâcare that is not accreditedâfor their children, nor do they want to make too many demands on grandparents. They do not mind leaving their children with a grandparent maybe one day a week, but they really do not want to leave them. They feel that it is unfair, and I have had many people in the office who have told me this. The government's voice of mutual obligation is extremely feeble. They do not want welfare dependent people but they are unwilling to adequately fund the structures and supports needed to maintain independence with dignity.</para><para>Child Care Australia reports closure of 280 centres since 1996 and a Productivity Commission report shows a reduction of just over 10 per cent in spending on child care per hour between 1995-96 and 1997-98. The implications of the government's response to child care are further supported by Roberta Ryan from the University of New South Wales who said on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>:</para><quote><para>We became very aware that the changes that the Government made for funding arrangements for child care were having significantly negative effects ... Average income earners are increasingly finding child care unaffordable.</para></quote><para>Why are numerous parents, industry representatives and academics complaining when, according to the minister, there has been a growth in places and centres? Are all these people simply making it up to annoy the minister? Remember the minister's response: </para><quote><para>Well, they should believe me, because I'm from the Government. </para></quote><para>If we are to believe the minister, why were the figures showing a drop in numbers of child-care services and places from June to December 1998 not mentioned?</para><para>The opposition is not convinced that the GST compensation provided in the family assistance legislation will be sufficient to compensate families for the increased costs they will face from 1 July. For that matter, families are already paying GST on services, such as insurance policies which extend beyond 1 July. Having heard and read evidence from the community groups, consumer advocates, academics and expert witnesses, I do not believe that the government's compensation measures are based on realistic assumptions about how families spend their meagre amounts. As a tax on consumption, the GST will hit families particularly hard. A whole range of goods and services has never been taxed before, including school uniforms and bus fares. These will be taxed at 10 per cent. The tax will also apply to utility bills. Families on ordinary incomes already find gas, electricity and phone bills are major items in their budget. Having 10 per cent added to these bills will not be eased much by an additional $350 a year.</para><para>One of the inherent problems with the ideologically driven economic agenda is the inability to allow for the specific needs of distinct economic regions. Tasmania has individual economic needs, largely through no fault of its own. Small economies are disadvantaged by efficiency drives as the scope for savings is not as great due to the laws pertaining to the economic scales. Community based not for profit providers largely serve our child-care industry. They actually account for the needs of 80 per cent of those requiring child-care services in my state. Thus the claims of 20 per cent fee increases are not dishonest in the Tasmanian context, as the minister, Senator Newman, would have us believe. The minister rightly stated that the 20 per cent increases are based on only one of the small and more expensive community sectors. Minister, in Tasmania, they represent 80 per cent of the providers. </para><para>Since the removal of the operational subsidy, many centres in Tasmania have had to increase fees. The first increase was $20 a week in 1996, followed by increases of $5 a week every year after that. Thus fees in Tasmania have increased by as much as $40 a week since the government came to power. One parent on the north-west coast said, `We have two children in full-time care which costs us twice what we would pay if we sent them to a private school. I cannot understand the logic of the proposed increased funding for private schools when the cost of child care is not addressed.' The family tax benefit and the child-care benefit, which are the central focus of this bill, will simply not compensate families for their GST losses and fail yet again to give back what the government has taken away.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>13713</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak at the second reading stage of the <inline ref="R1007">A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000</inline>, which is a piece of legislation that predominantly builds on the family assistance act that was passed last year around the end of June and is obviously built into and related to the new tax system. At that time the Democrats supported that legislation as part of a positive component of the new tax system that the government was putting forward. It was positive for a range of measures, not least of which was the simplification that was involved in its bringing together, into a smaller number of payments, a large number of existing payments. It pulled them together into just two or three payments.</para></talk.start><para>The purposes or aims of this bill, according to the explanatory memorandum put out by the government, are to provide the administrative infrastructure to support the payment of child-care benefit, to clarify the operation of various aspects of the family assistance law, to replace regulation making powers with substantive provisions, to insert relevant savings and transitional provisions, and to make other miscellaneous technical amendments. That is a very general way of describing what is a very large piece of legislation, going to a little bit over 300 pages. Virtually all of those aims or purposes the Democrats would support as building on the initial legislation, the purpose of which the party also supported.</para><para>There is one issue relating to the new family tax benefit and how it will be applied in shared caring arrangements. That is an issue of particular interest and concern to the Democrats that will be explored further, I am sure, in the committee stage of the debate. I know that some amendments have been circulated by the opposition in relation to that. I think the other issues raised as part of that are significant ones. They are ones that I will not comment on at the moment because they are more appropriate for in-depth exploration at the committee stage, where aspects of them could do with further elaboration, exploration and clarification. I expect the overall aspect of the legislation comes under the description of `clarifying the operation' of various aspects of the family assistance law. That is a nice general phrase but what it means in practice, in terms of its impact on people, is something that it is important to make clear before such measures are passed. Certainly, the committee stage of the debate is more appropriate for that aspect of this bill.</para><para>Given the enormity of the changeâand it is a very significant change, shifting such a large number of payments into a smaller number and in many ways increasing the interface between the social security system and the tax systemâit is not surprising that we do get, and have to deal with, a large piece of legislation. Indeed, this bill, which is meant to beâor purported to beâand was put forward as a predominantly administrative bill, has nonetheless about 300 pages. When we look back at the predominant act that it is relating to and the very significant and wide-ranging changes that were made in that, it is not surprising that attempts to try to assess all the various ramifications of such changes can prove very difficult. From the Democrats' perspective, as often is the case with bills amending social security law, we have received a number of representations, some of which relate to quite minor matters in the grand scheme of things. Nonetheless, any issue that may negatively impact on a small number of people still needs proper clarification and examination. </para><para>In relation to this bill, the Democrats have chosen to take an approach where, while we recognise most of those issues as areas of potential concern, we also recognise the potential urgency of this matter and also the complexity of the overall primary legislation and so have chosen not to pursue a lot of those through amendments or indeed even through extensive questioning in the committee stage of this debate. With virtually every piece of legislation, let alone social security legislation, governments tend to suggest that every bill is urgent, every bill is immediate, every bill would be facing impending peril if it were not passed forthwith and that they really cannot afford to have things mucked around by the parliament putting forward proposed amendments to improve it or to address potential negative consequences or anomalies. Normally, I look on such claims very sceptically. But with this particular bill, because of the need to ensure that the new family assistance regime does operate as smoothly as possible and is in place and ready to go on 1 July, I will give that a bit more credence than I normally would.</para><para>Obviously, the enhanced family assistance regime is integral to the overall package of measures that is meant to ensure positive outcomes overall for people when we move to the new tax system. Whilst it is probably not correct to describe some aspects of the family assistance regime as compensation measures, nonetheless, when we look at the whole tax package and all the various modellings that were done by a range of peopleâat the time and subsequentlyâabout the impacts of the new tax package, the effect of the GST and related measures, we see that one central component of modelling the overall, final outcome of winners and losers relates to the family assistance package and particularly the new family tax benefit. That being the case, it is appropriate on this particular occasion not to impede the progress of that over some of the areas of concern. Some of them relate to such issues as residency, access by people in particular circumstances under particular visas to be able to get certain payments, and some of the changes in approach that may occur in dealing with a payment that is now, in effect, being deemed to be a payment through social security.</para><para>Even though people can claim it through the tax system at the end of the year, there will undoubtedly be circumstances where some anomalies and changes of circumstance will apply to people. That is inevitable when you are collapsing 12 payments down to three. But I think some of those are ones that can be considered in an ongoing way, whether through further amending legislation or through other processes internally within the government. In that context, hopefully the government will recognise that the Democrats have chosen not to raise a range of amendments to areas that are linked to concerns that have been raised. However, the particular issue of shared care arrangements is one that seems to us to be quite a significant change that at this stage we cannot ascertain as being present in the primary legislation or as being flagged in any way at the time through second reading speeches or any other clear mechanism of the government that made people aware of the significance of the change. </para><para>The initial act was put through at a time when obviously very major changes were being made to the overall tax system and the ability to scrutinise all its potential impacts was somewhat more limited. Nonetheless, as I said, if there are potential negative impacts to small areas, they are ones that can be assessed once the scheme comes into operation. But it does seem, on examination of the issue by the Democrats to date, that the proposed changes affecting shared care arrangements specifically contained in this bill that, as far as I can ascertain, were not contained in the original bill are ones that do deserve significant examination and they are ones that we would be keen to see elaborated on further and scrutinised further during the committee stage of this particular debate, that being one of the primary purposes of having a committee stage of a debate: to examine a bill and its impacts in detail on any area of concern. So I certainly flag that as an area that we are strongly interested in. I also re-emphasise that, whilst other areas may be of concern to us, we have chosen not to pursue them at this time because of the nature of the bill and the time lines. I recognise the inevitable complexity of making a change of this nature, so they are changes we will pursue at a more leisurely pace, if you like, without in any way suggesting that we are ignoring them or not prepared to continue to follow them through.  </para><para>We do flag an interest and a particular concern in relation to the impact of the carer arrangements for the family tax benefits and what effect that may have on the overall entitlements of quite a significant number of people in the Australian community. In all the modelling that was done before, during and after the agreement on the tax package, as far as I am aware there was no modelling done that took into account the impact of a reduction in overall family tax benefit payments for primary care givers in shared care arrangements. That is something that I think needs to be examined further, because obviously those people that agreed with the tax package did so after having paid very close attention to the modelling that was done at that time and ensuring that peopleâparticularly in some of the more disadvantaged groups, and sole parents are clearly amongst thoseâwere not going to be in a position where they were worse off. The potential impact on sole parents of a change in the entitlement to shared care arrangements does link specifically to whether or not those people would be worse off overall, and that is something that does need appropriate scrutiny before the change is agreed to. Clearly in this bill that change is proposed, and that is something that does need scrutiny. I look forward to being able to do so further in the committee stage of the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>13715</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis bill, the <inline ref="R1007">A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000</inline>, is the last in the package of family assistance bills. The main legislation passed last year established the new family tax benefits A and B and the child-care benefit. This final bill has no real central theme but makes a large number of amendments to existing legislation, particularly the family assistance and family assistance administration acts, to specify administrative arrangements particularly for the child-care benefit and to correct anomalies that have been discovered since the 1999 legislation was enacted. I noticed as I sat here that there were some extra amendments to be moved by the government along the way as well.</para></talk.start><para>While there may not be a dominant central theme to the bill, Labor's view of the family assistance package is that it fails to counterbalance the increased costs that the GST will impose on family budgets or to compensate for the higher child-care costs that have resulted from four years of funding cuts to that program by this government. The bill must be seen in the context of the GST and of the government's record on family services since 1996. Viewed in that perspective, the gains for families look much less generous than the government would have people believe. When examined in detail, a number of particular problems with the payment systems become apparent. I note Senator Bartlett's comments, because I think there is a problem in trying to deal with some of those issues in this bill. The complexity of the package and the fact that a lot of the legislation has already passed make it very hard to try and pull out particular measures.</para><para>Labor will not oppose the bill, but we are convinced, on the evidence that has already been considered by the Senate in the GST inquiry and elsewhere, that the compensation that the bill provides is grossly inadequate. The GST will impose a major new tax burden on family necessities such as clothing, many foods, public transport fares and utilitiesâthings that have never been taxed before. The compensation is based on assumptions about price increases that the Treasury has already been forced to revise upwards. The real impact of the GST will be known in three months time.</para><para>We have opposed this tax from the beginning, and we put on record again our belief that this massive tax mix switch to consumption taxes will have a serious impact on low- and middle-income families who have to spend most of their income. Compared to the scale of the GST, which will tax necessities of life that have never been taxed before, the benefits introduced by the family assistance legislation package are inadequate. Labor supports the simplification of child-care benefits but is not convinced that the small increase in benefits will be enough to restore the child-care fee relief that has been ripped off parents in the last four years. The government's tax package brings a massive tax mix switch from low- and middle-income earners to higher income earners in Australia.  </para><para>The government has channelled all its energies into the delivery of a package which makes life tougher for Australian families. Make no mistake: the insidious GST is a tax on families. At the same time, this government hands out its tax relief disproportionately to the well off. It puts a new tax on gas and electricity bills, on school lunches and uniforms, on baby bottles and breast pumps, on haircuts and public transport. The tax will also apply to utility bills. Families on ordinary incomes already find gas, electricity and phone bills a major item in their budget. Having 10 per cent added to these bills will be a major burden which will not be eased much by the sort of money that the governments is offering in compensation. The GST reaches into every corner of Australian family life. The poorer the family, the more income they devote to life's bare necessities, and the more that is clawed away from them.</para><para>Before the Democrats say that their deal improves the lot of low-income families, they should check the numbers. The Democrats' deal with the government improved the lot of the poorest family with two kids by 99c per week. The deal makers and the Democrats were prepared to settle for an extra dollar per week, and then claimed that the gain of $1 made the original ANTS package fairer for families. We think the government have frittered away a surplus on tax cuts to the wealthy. It is important to ask whose surplus they have grandly thrown away. This was a surplus generated by families. It was built from harsh cuts to child care, health, education and community services. They took services away from the families in greatest need of support and handed the proceeds to the richâa straight redistribution of funds from the poor to the rich.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âWhy do you mislead the Senate?

You are not proud of your record on child care because you have been rolled in cabinet time and time again. You take away from the poor and you redistribute to the rich. All of the tax cuts, all of the benefits, go to the top end of town. We have found out in the last few weeksâas shown by all those ads you are putting on TVâthat the benefits are not being delivered as you promised and that a lot of assumptions have been proved to be false. I shall come to that soon and, Minister, you will have your turn later. It is the low- and middle-income families, working families, who have made sacrifices for years, who have borne the burden and have suffered the government cutbacks. On 1 July, they will be thumped again. Australians on low and middle incomes have been asked to take on trust the assertion that the government's compensation measures will not be rapidly eroded by inflation over time. Yet Treasury officials have, effectively, confirmed that compensation to pensioners will disappear over time. Australian families have been asked to take on trust that the GST will stay at 10 per cent forever. The commitment denies the international experience. Wherever the GST has gone, its rate has risen. Moreover, the idea that the need for a unanimous agreement between the states and the Commonwealth will protect families from a creeping GST is dishonest in the extreme. A Commonwealth law can be changed by the Commonwealth parliament, and the states' opinions will, of course, be irrelevant.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition do not believe the government's claim that the GST will, on average, increase prices by less than two per cent. We are not alone in that view. The host of expert witnesses who gave evidence to the tax inquiry do not believe it. Leading economists have dismissed this assumption and have shown that, by underestimating the price increase, the government has overstated the gains and understated the losses arising from the tax package. In their evidence to the Senate hearings, Professors Ann Harding and Neil Warren, charged by the committee to examine the distributional implications of the package, showed that there would be hidden losers from the tax package. The opposition were not surprised to hear that chief among the hidden losers would be those on low incomes. Nor does the Australian public believe that prices will rise by only 1.9 per cent. As 1 July draws closer, the government is losing the faith. The Prime Minister promised before the last election that the price of the average new car would fall by eight per cent, but his industry minister, Senator Minchin, told the Senate estimates on 7 February this year: </para><quote><para>We do not dictate prices. It is a matter for the manufacturers and the dealers and everybody else in terms of their pricing as to what the ultimate price will be. </para></quote><para>The Prime Minister also promised that there would be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer, but Treasury officials have admitted that beer prices over the bar will rise by more than seven per cent. Australians cannot afford to take this government and its assumptions and claims on trust.</para><para>The benefits that this legislation introduces are feeble compensation for such a far-reaching tax. Family tax benefit A, which replaces family allowance and family tax payments, provides up to $140 a year more for each dependent child. The government also claims that family tax benefit B, which replaces assistance for parents who are caring for children, provides approximately $300 extra per annum for single income families with dependent children aged under five. But, having heard the evidence given by community groups, consumer advocates, academics and other expert witnesses, I do not believe that the government's compensation measures are based on realistic assumptions about how families spend their income. The noted Australian National University demographer Professor Peter McDonald calculated that the GST compensation was based on the premise that a child will cost a family only an extra 30c a week in GST costs. As a tax on consumption, the GST will hit families particularly hard. Behind the pro-family rhetoric of the government are distinctly anti-family policies such as this new tax on the necessities of life. Labor will pass the compensation measures contained in this bill, but we continue our opposition to the introduction of the GST.</para><para>While Labor is not convinced that the government is providing adequate compensation for the price effects of the GST, there are also some quite specific problems with the GST compensation mechanisms, particularly for family tax benefit part B. Three months before the introduction of the GST, the measures which are supposed to provide compensation for price effects are being exposed as inadequate. Only last week it was revealed that family tax benefit B, which will replace the parenting payment for single income families, contains what one newspaper called with considerable understatement `an unintended consequence of the new simplified system'. In fact, tens of thousands of women on maternity leave will not receive family tax benefit part B because of the design of the income testing system. The payment is worth a maximum of $101 per fortnight and is available to both two-and one-parent families. The upper income threshold for the payment is $10,416 per annum.</para><para>The problem arises because family tax benefit B will be based on an estimation of income in the current financial year rather than the fortnightly assessments which apply to parenting payment. In a case study prepared by the opposition, the effects of this relative inflexibility are illustrated. If a woman takes a year's maternity leave from December 1999 and returns to work in January 2001, she notifies Centrelink that she expects to earn more than $10,416 in the 2000-01 financial year. Because of her earnings in the first half of 2001, when she will be back at work, she will be denied family tax benefit part B throughout the 2000-01 financial year, even though she will not be receiving any wages in the first half of itâthat is, in the period July to December 2000. Under the current system her income would be assessed fortnightly, so she would not be penalised in the second half of 2000 for income she has not yet received. The inequity of this measure is illustrated by the fact that a woman whose maternity leave coincides with the financial year avoids the income test altogether. Labor see this measure as unfair and ill designed. Given the complexity of the family assistance package, however, it seems impossible to be able to amend this provision. We urge the government to have another look at this issue to see how it might be solved. </para><para>Labor also has some serious concerns about the bill's impact on the family tax benefit entitlements of custodial parents whose care of a child is shared with the estranged partner. These measures are not connected with the GST so much as with policy on the interaction of the child support and social security systems. Senator Bartlett alluded to them earlier in his contribution. Previously, family payments could be divided only once the non-custodial parent had a share of at least 30 per cent of the care. As I understand it, this was not enshrined in legislation but in regulation. A successful Federal Court challenge to these regulations has meant that, in practice, sharing of payments has occurred once any sharing of care takes place. This bill seeks to legislate for a minimum 10 per cent threshold. </para><para>The most critical issue raised by this measure is the level of care at which sharing of payments should commence. There is a number of precedents and arguments for standardising the threshold at 30 per cent. Child support payments are not reduced until the non-resident parent is providing care for the child or children for 30 per cent of the time. The current family tax initiative also operates with a 30 per cent threshold test. Labor believe that family payments should be brought into line with these standards. We are yet to see a justification for putting the rules for family tax benefit part B out of line with the other family payment systems. This measure represents a decision on the part of the government to set the threshold at 10 per cent as opposed to 30 per cent. </para><para>Labor remain opposed to this change on several grounds. Firstly, we recognise that the overwhelming burden of costs in raising a child will be borne by the custodial parent in most cases unless care is shared to a significant extent. Where children spend less than 30 per cent of their time being cared for by the non-custodial parent, it can reasonably be expected that the custodial parent will provide a room, clothes and all the other supports. This will extend to the provision of support for a travelling childâthat is, when the child visits the non-custodial parent, clothes and other items will be supplied by the custodial parent and cleaned by the custodial parent. Therefore, we are concerned that the government's lowering of the threshold for shared care will reduce the financial means of custodial parents despite their having to meet the great majority of the costs of raising that child.</para><para>A second issue arises from reducing the threshold. The government claims this measure will give effect to 1996 family law reforms. Labor's view, however, is that far from encouraging a non-custodial parent to take a significant caring roleâthat is, 30 per cent or greaterâthe measures will financially reward those who undertake a minimum level of care. Practically, sharing of care will often be less disruptive where the non-custodial parent is able to provide a greater, rather than a lesser level of care. This measure does not encourage non-custodial parents to take on a greater level of care. </para><para>In the committee stage, Labor will move to amend the bill to set the threshold for shared care at 30 per cent. Senator Bartlett has flagged the interest of the Democrats in the proposition, so it will be interesting to hear a fuller explanation from the minister as to justification of the government's proposal for a 10 per cent threshold. Our amendment would establish 30 per cent as the normal threshold for shared care, but we would allow the department to split family tax benefit entitlements for care burdens of less than 30 per cent, provided that a number of conditions were met. The secretary would have to determine that the child was eligible for family tax benefit, that a claim had been made by the non-custodial parent, that the claim was justified and that both parents agreed to the claim. The requirement for agreement is in line with current administrative practice, where the department does recognise care burdens of less than 30 per cent, but only if both parents agree that this is a fair division of responsibility. Agreement is obviously a key element that is missing from the government's bill. It is unlikely that a financial inducement to share care is the basis for more effective parenting where partners are separated. These matters need to be negotiated in good faith. </para><para>Another of the provisions in this bill concerns the social security appeal rights. The government is making yet another attempt to hamper the appeal rights of Centrelink clients. The opposition and the Democrats have successfully defeated such attempts in the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 and the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 in respect of time limits on internal appeals and appeals to the SSAT. This bill would require any new evidence that came before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to be referred back to the original decision maker. We think that adding this extra step will only make appeals more time consuming and complicated. Nor are we convinced that referring evidence back to the original decision maker is necessary in order that the evidence be properly examined. If the tribunal is qualified to examine the appeal case, then it is capable of examining any new evidence on that case. In committee we will move an amendment to preserve the current arrangements whereby the tribunal would consider any new evidence on its merits.</para><para>In addition to the specific problems with the family tax benefit part B and maternity allowance, and with the appeal rights issue, Labor has serious concerns about the requirement for families to estimate their annual income when applying for family tax benefit. Technically, no-one will be forced to make an estimate; people can opt to receive the FTB in a lump sum at the end of the year. But in reality all but high-income families will need to receive the benefit fortnightly, and that will require them to estimate their future income. Increasingly, workers' hours are becoming more unpredictable and estimating income has become much harder.</para><para>The government seems to have learned nothing from the debt problem caused by income estimation for other family benefits. An audit of DSS debts in the December quarter of 1998 found that more debts were raised for family payments than for any other payment type. Thirty-two per cent of family payments were found to be in error, and the average debt for each family was $1,000. The government has been criticised in reports by the Ombudsman and the Auditor-General for placing an unfair burden of compliance on families in respect of the extremely complex rules which govern their payments. </para><para>Furthermore, current Centrelink rules allow a 10 per cent margin of error. Labor is particularly concerned that this bill would allow no margin of error whatsoever. I place on record that the estimation provisions of the legislation are likely to increase the problems of families facing debts to Centrelink. This is not our idea of tax and welfare reform. We think we will need to monitor it closely, but I think the government ought to have a rethink about that issue as well.</para><para>If I had more time, I would address some comments to the child-care benefit changes that the government is introducing. They are an important part of the legislation in this package. Because I am running out of time, I would like to say that, while we support the general thrust of the changes regarding the amalgamation of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate, I have a number of concerns about some of the claims made by the government on behalf of those measures. I suppose the best thing for me to do is raise those in the committee stage to get an explanation from the minister, but my central point is that these changes have to be taken in the context of the government's overall policy in relation to child care and its record over the last few years, particularly in relation to indexation. Effectively, three years indexation has not been passed on to families and will be wrapped up as an increase in funding in this measure but, in fact, we are only compensating them for indexation denied previously.</para><para>In conclusion, Labor will be supporting the thrust of the bill, but we have a range of concerns, some of which are not able to be addressed by amendments, but those which can will be addressed by amendment in the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>13720</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising also to speak on <inline ref="R1007">A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000</inline>, I wish to focus my comments this evening on the implications of the bill for child-care services for Australian families. The bill makes a number of changes to the way families receive support for child-care services. The bill changes the current child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate structures, which will be rolled into one paymentâthe child-care benefit. Labor supports the amalgamation of the two payment structures into one. The other simplifications in the bill, including the elimination of the fee ceiling and the minimum fee, will simplify payment arrangements. We will also support the institution of the 10 per cent increase in support for part-time care, acknowledging the impact that reduction to 50 hours work related care had, especially on the long day care sector. I am aware of many day care centres which stopped providing part-time care after 1996 because of the costs associated with staffing for that care, even though the reality is that more and more families are requiring and demanding part-time care. </para></talk.start><para>The bill changes the rate at which child-care benefit will be paid. Through this bill, the government has raised the level of payment for child-care benefit. The result of the amendments has been assessed by Don Siemon and Greg Ford in their article `Improving child care subsidies', published in <inline font-style="italic">Brotherhood Comment</inline> in 1999. They say the net benefit for lower income families using long day care centres will be $1âyes, only $1âper week. Since the election of the Howard government, the average weekly cost of child care has risen by at least $20. This bill realigns the support for families to the level that was provided in 1995. Unfortunately, it does not recognise or redress the erosion of support in the intervening four years. Unfortunately, the bill does not take the opportunity to redress the problems in the child-care sector originating from this government's introduction of the 50-hour cap on work related care. This measure has effectively resulted in families not having support for one-fifth of the care they have to pay for. Consequently there have been many cases where families have had to remove children from formal care arrangements or move children to care arrangements that they would prefer not to use.</para><para>This brings me to the issues around the funding of child care over the past few years. Senator Newman regularly stands up in this chamber and tells us that child-care funding has not been cut over the last four years. This is patently untrue, as her own annual reports attest. Actual spending has fallen from $1,066 million in the government's first budget in 1996-97 to $999.4 million in the second 1997-98 budget and fell again in the most recently completed budget to $935.7 million. In answer to a question on notice in Senate estimates in 1997, the Howard government confirmed that it intended to cut funding to child care over the period from 1996 to 2001 by a total of $851 million. It is wrong and it is unfair to the sector and to its user families that Senator Newman continually and incorrectly fudges the figures. It is time the government faces up to the fact that it always had the agenda of decreasing funding to child care with impacts on families, on the small businesses supplying child careâboth those operated by the community sector and those operated by private providersâand to the workers in the child-care sector.</para><para>Through the implementation of this bill, families will decide how they will receive their child-care benefitâeither paid directly to an approved child-care service or paid annually in arrears directly to the parents. It is our view that almost all families will opt for having their child-care benefit paid directly to the child-care service. Most families using child care are strictly managing budgets on a week-to-week basis. They are not able to wait until the end of the financial year to receive one payment for their child-care support. </para><para>The bill will require families to predict their annual income for the purposes of claiming their child-care benefit. This provision requires families to estimate their annual income in advance with no margin for error. The government is well aware of the difficulties this structure provides, especially for families on low and middle incomes. It is very clear that only families on high incomesâthat is, some of the families who currently receive only the child-care cash rebateâwill claim support for the year past. They can afford to pay their child care on a weekly basis without the support measures included. They will be able to avoid the errors in their claims, but those who are required to predict their income will unfortunately make mistakes in estimating their incomes with the result that they may end up with a debt to the government. The government knows the dangers that estimating income in advance brings to families. Existing income estimation rules have resulted in tens of thousands of debts being incurred by low and middle income families who have not intended to deceive the government but have made errors in the assessment of their income. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âThey were your rules.

It is the family support measures. The government is not accommodating the reality that many people's incomes change and the fact that people who are on low incomes often move in and out of the work force and have a high rate of casualisation in their work patterns. They have varied patterns of income, which makes income estimation difficult, if not impossible. These families will be disadvantaged at the end of the year when they file their return and find out that their estimation of income was incorrect. Of those families who were reviewed for the financial year 1998-99, the rate of error for families receiving family payment who had to estimate income in advance was 35 per cent. These are not families who are misleading the government about their level of income. They are simply making inaccurate estimations of their income with the result that they will have to find those resources in a lump sum in order to clear the debt. These are families who do not have access to large amounts of cash sitting in a bank account to pay off a potential debt to government. I am yet to be convinced that moving from the current system, where the last financial year is used as a basis for assessing the child-care benefit, will be simpler for families.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The bill corrects the anomaly where families using outside school hours care will not be disadvantaged when they have a child at a long day care centre and at outside school hours care. The anomaly has affected the viability of many outside school hours care services and caused many long day care centres to take up the option of providing care to school age children. There have been some instances where school age children have been cared for alongside toddlers in child-care centres. This is not a good situation. It can now be avoided, and families will not be disadvantaged. Most of the measures in the bill are responding to calls from families, the child-care sector and the Labor Party to redress the impacts of changes that the government has introduced over the past few years, but it is unfortunate that they do not go far enough. In November last year, Senator Chris Evans, Labor's shadow minister, introduced a private senator's bill. The intent of the <inline ref="S238">Child Care Legislation Amendment (High Need Regions) Bill 1999</inline> was to reintroduce needs based planning for long day care. It was well received by child-care providers and the sector across the nations. This bill has not been defeated and is still before the Senate.</para><para>The government's actions in abandoning needs based planning will call into question the viability of up to 100 child-care centres. It will allow new child-care centres access to child-care assistance in competition with existing child-care services. Competition in human services is fraught with danger. It will unnecessarily reduce the quality of care as centres have to cut costs in order to stay open. I call on the government to reintroduce needs based planning for long day care. At least 390 centres have closed since the Howard government was elected in 1996. The total number of centres has fallen from 4,170 in June 1998 to 4,013 in June 1999, a drop of 157 centres. The actual number of places in long day care has declined from 194,600 in June 1998 to 190,300 in June 1999, a loss of 4,300 places. These are the government's own figures. They clearly show that families have either had to change their access to work in order to care for children or have taken up unregulated options that provide reduced safeguards and monitoring of quality of care for their children. Further, it is evident that the number of low income families using child care has fallen. In 1999, there were 8,500 fewer children from lower income families using child care for preschool purposes than in 1996-97. Where are these children going to preschool? Are they receiving a preschool education? We all know that it is the preschool years that provide the sound basis for a successful education. If they are not receiving that essential preschool education, we are disadvantaging them in their future.  </para><para>Research undertaken by the office of the shadow minister, Senator Evans, has revealed that it is in the areas of lower income where most of the child-care centres have closed. This further supports Labor's view that it is the removal of access to child care through such measures as the introduction of the 50-hour cap on supported care and the growth in the gap between child-care assistance and feesâa gap currently about $20 more per week than in 1996âthat have impacted more seriously on centres in lower income areas. The government needs to seriously address the problems that are being experienced in these areas and to act. Labor supports most of the intent of the bill but recognises that it does not go far enough in addressing the broader concerns of Australian families and the child-care sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>13722</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on this bill, <inline ref="R1007">A New Tax System (Family Assistance and Related Measures) Bill 2000</inline>.

I cannot but expect that most citizens are becoming exhausted at the changes in this area. Indeed, figures given to me over the weekendâthey were anecdotal and I have no guarantee or assurance that they were accurate, so I am not going to cite themâsuggest that there is a very significant retreat from the accountancy profession by accountants who are exhausted by, if not overloaded with, the number of changes. I think this is a matter of significant concern. If the accountants are giving up exhausted, or at least finding it a bit overwhelming, it is nothing to what it is doing to Mr and Mrs Average Citizen who are having to cope with significant changes affecting the funding of their lives.

I recall just what a savage attack child care has been under by this government. It is interesting that the government has now come around to a number of the points that it argued savagely against in the past and certainly argued vehemently against when it was in opposition. I, probably more than most, remember the colour of the accreditation debate with a certain wry smile. For a lot of us who campaigned so hard to have child-care provisions available for the community, it is a matter of great disappointmentâand that is the kindest way I can put itâthat there has been such a closing down of child care.

Perhaps you can put them on the record later. I wonder whether you mightâthrough you, Madam Acting Deputy Presidentâaddress the contradiction, it seems to me, of a government culture or inclination to help families rear children by having at least one parent stay at home. There has not been a campaign overtly to suggest parents give away child care, but there has been a lot of inducement to assist families to understand the virtues of rearing children at home. There is assistance for parents who do that. Indeed, it has been argued as an emphasis to assist families to have one parent at home providing care for their children, as against the kind of care that is provided in child-care centres. If that is not your policy, Minister, I would be very pleased to hear a clear statement of that not being the case. Anybody looking in from the outside would have to say that child care has been seen as something second-class compared with a parent at home. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been an interesting contradiction between the policy for two-parent families and the recent welfare document which suggests that single parents will be encouraged to get into the work force as soon as possible. I would have to ask the minister why it is that single parents are not being encouraged to have the same right of staying at home and caring for their children as two-parent families. That is a clear contradiction in policy and I would be very pleased if the minister would care to explain it. The whole point is that over the time of this government there have been major cuts, as figures from the estimates would tell us, in the child-care area. If I say that $851 million has been removed from child care between 1996 and 2001, I might hear oppositional groans. There is a silence which is interesting. It probably means: yes, we admit at last that these were the figures provided in estimates.</para><para>The clear implication and the clear understanding is that there were cuts made to child care. To put these reductions in perspective, the total cuts to current and planned spending amounted to some $850 million over five years, at about 85 per cent of the current annual budget. The 1996-97 budget included a cut as a result of the changes to the child-care assistance income tests. The abolition of additional income allowed for additional children saved $77.7 million. With the abolition of the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres, effective from 1 July 1997, there was an estimated saving by government of $108.8 million. The reduction of child-care assistance income cut-offs for second and subsequent children saved $13.2 million. Capping access to child-care assistance for work related care at 50 hours a week saved $106 million. Freezing child-care assistance and rebate ceilings for 1997 and 1998 saved $84.8 million. Reducing the rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families above the family tax initiative income threshold saved $34.7 million. The abolition of the new growth strategy for community and employer provided care saved $79.5 million. In the 1997-98 budget there was a move to pay child-care assistance fortnightly in arrears with a saving of $38.8 million. Broadbanding other family and children's services savedâif not a cutâ$22.8 million. Capping non-work related care at 20 hours per week saved $80.7 million. I will not remind the minister of the arguments used in this place by herself and her colleagues in opposition about any caps on work related care. The number of new places was to be limited to 7,000 in 1998-99 to save $206.9 million. In 1998-99, the only budget measure was an additional $600,000 for an information campaign. In the 1999-2000 budget there were no new measures for child care. The family assistance bill increases for child-care assistance will not commence until the next financial year.</para><para>That brings me to another point I wish to raise and that is the underspend of child-care assistance.

The first and most important thing is that changes in funding arrangements by the government have meant that the gap on average has expanded byâdepending on which bit of paper you readâ$20 to $30 a week. This means that for most people child care is no longer affordable; it is just no longer affordable. It means that thousands of families are making the decision to not use child care. They are retreating from child care or they are using it two or three days a weekânot the full time that they have done previously. Hence, one of the significant reasons that the child-care assistance is less than has been budgeted for. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is very important to realise what this means: for a very low income family, paying $20 or $30 a week for child care might have been manageable, but paying $50 is completely outside their range. So they have trimmed their child care to what they can afford. They are retreating from the child care, and if they are lucky they will get informal care. But what often happens is that they have to cut down their hours of work too. That, plus the change that has seen a very significant move to the casualisation of the work force, means that many families are not provided with the hours of work, and that has had a secondary spin-off in cutting back further the usage of child care, particularly long day care child care. So the cost pressures have seen a very significant pressure on families.</para><para>The second thing that has happened is that there have been closures of a significant number of child-care centres. As reported to me, many of those have been community based centres, and they have closed in the lower income areas. So one of the very important requirements or policy preferments of the previous Labor government for child care was that it was not solely concentrated on providing care for people in the work force; that it was also about providing a community facility; and that it was also about an opportunity for parents who had very little chance to get out of home and leave their kids to have a bit of time for themselves. Those opportunities are now significantly reduced in those communities that have a significantly high need or demand for such child care. I would be surprised if it were your intention for that to happen, Minister, but I am certainly clear on the figures that it is happening and I certainly think that it is a policy difference between us.</para><para>We were very concerned to make sure that child care was provided for working parents and for non-working parents. And we were also very concerned that child care was affordable, particularly for those lower income families. Both of those things are significantly altered under this government. I know the reasons, because I have read out the litany of cuts and changes in the financial arrangements in child care that have meant that there have been some very significant changes to the funding and affordability of child care. It is just not the same. I do not know how you cannot agree with it. These are official figures. These are not things that I have made up. These are official figures of what have been the changing cut-backs in the child-care area, and the consequences are exactly as I have described. </para><para>I note my colleague Senator McLucas's concerns about the assessment of income for families based on current year income. As I understood it, the minister was interjecting at that time on Senator McLucas. I could not understand what she was saying, but I hope the minister might explain in a way that makes it clear. We can pursue in the committee stage of this legislation why she is sure that this is a better way to go. Certainly, those of us who have watched the way family income has been assessed for eligibility for payments over the last number of years have seen how wrong it has been and how we have had to change it. The Labor government appreciated that it had got it less than optimal and introduced its own changes in that area. I suppose we are raising a big concern about the current arrangements, which are, as we read it, on an annual assessment of income and not on a fortnightly assessment. That is maybe not the only factor but it is certainly one that means people have to come up with their best guess of what their income will be over the year. If they get it wrongâand the evidence shows already that many doâthen they finish up with a debt. Most of these families are not flush. They do not have much money to play around with to pay back any overpayment based on their wrong assessment of their income.  </para><para>Certainly, Minister, if you can, either in your comments or in the committee stage, take us through that process and try to convince us that we are not wrong on this, I think that would be of use. But I certainly have to say that, so far, there is a very big caution from not only me but also others that this way of doing it has already been tried and has been found extremely wanting. These families are not at the top end of the scale. They are the families who, if they have a mortgage, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> the other day, have just lost all the so-called benefits of the tax cuts that will be coming to them on 1 July. There will not be any savings for them because their money is already eaten up by the increased interest rates and the increased payments on their mortgages.</para><para>In child care and in a lot of areas related to it there is also a very significant increase in outlays because of the introduction of the GST. Families are right to be concerned. Most of the families that we are talking aboutâparticularly those using child care and very finely balancing their income to make it stretch to cover the child-care costs that enable them to study, to work or to have some occasional careâare already, on the evidence, cutting back their hours significantlyâwitness the cut in the child-care assistance payments. Those families do not have spare money to adjust to the increased costs that will occur with the GST. One of the things that the government is trying to convince families of is that they do not need to worry because they will get this whacking great tax cut that will come with the introduction of the GST. According to all sorts of evidence, those families that have a mortgage have lost most of those tax cuts, if not all of them, with the interest rate rises.</para><para>So for families who are concerned, all I can say is that this piece of legislation is yet another bill in a very complex series on the tax package and the adjustments that go with it. These are very complex changes to child care. I think one should be very cautious about the changes in legislation. We have seen the costs of child care significantly increase. We have seen the usage of child care significantly decrease. We have seen the closure of a large number of centres, particularly community based centres and particularly in the lower income areas.</para><para>There is a major concern about the way the so-called family payment assessment will be made, which I have already alluded to, and I certainly think that we should advance very cautiously on barracking for these changes. They have been tried and found wanting in previous arenas and times. Certainly the Labor Party remains to be convinced that this is the way to go. If we are wrong, then perhaps you can spell that out for us, Minister. At the moment, I would be saying to families that there is very little comfort from the government, either in this piece of legislation or in the tax package altogether. I have argued at other times in this place and in other places that the tax changes this government is introducing will divide Australia into the haves and the have nots. The people I am talking about who are the users of the sorts of child-care centres we are talking about are those who are going to be hurt by the GST, not rolling in wealth and riches. They will struggle to continue to afford their child care.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>13725</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWell, that was a nice, vigorous debate, Senator Crowley. Thank you for your contributionâas always, plenty of vigour, not too much fact. But I would be very happy during the course of the time I have available to me this evening to set you straight if I can. First of all, I will respond to Senator Bartlett. There are two or three things that I thought would be useful to respond to quickly now. He referred to the 10 per cent shared care and suggested that there was no advance information about that. I think I am precising him accurately. That 10 per cent shared care measure was, of course, in the 1999 legislation. It was available for all senators to study and to debate. The measure was not disputed in the Senate. I acknowledge that that could be for a number of reasons, but it was in no way hidden from the Senate. I will obviously be ready to respond to some of the other comments on the shared care measure during the committee stage. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett also referred to the volume of amendments in this bill. He understood that there is a great deal of material coming through that is administrative and that goes to building on the material in the 1999 legislation. One of the things that is perhaps worth putting on the record is that there are something like 200 pages, out of the total 303 pages in this bill, that replace the child-care benefit regulation making powers with the substantive provisionsâin other words, what we are trying to do now with this legislation, to the extent we possibly can, is to put regulations into the legislation instead of leaving them as regulations. I would think that most senators would find that a valuable exercise in itself, although that is what makes the bill we are debating today such a large one.

I have given you reasons why this is so, and they are similar reasons to why it was so under your government. Let me take you through some of them. There is a declining population of nought to four-year-olds in this countryâthere is a declining birthrate so there are declining numbers of nought to four-year olds. In Tasmania, the population of preschools has gone down by 2,000 children since 1996, just in our tiny state. That is what child-care centres, private or publicly owned, are contending with: a declining population of nought to four-year-olds and a stable labour force of women with young children. More flexible family-friendly working environments have allowed women to choose to work, for example, three long days and not five short days, if that be their choice for their particular family needs. That has made a difference to how they use child care. For example, there is an increase in part-time work, and of course there has been a huge increase in women's full-time jobs as well. There has also been an increase in casual work. Women have been great winners out of the improvement in the economy. There has been a lowering of the preschool entry age in several states, and that has a very significant impact on child care. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âYou are right on that one.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âThank you.

There is now a much better match of service charging practices with family usage. That is good news for both families and taxpayers. Of course, the rate of growth of child-care fees under Labor was considerably in excess of the rate of growth of child-care fees since we have been in government. It is amazing, isn't it? Child-care centres were like the families that were using them: subject to enormous interest rates. Those families were using child care so they could work in order to pay the mortgage, and interest rates were up to 17 per cent under Labor. Plenty of families were working at that stage, out of sheer compulsion to keep a roof over their heads. Some of them do not feel the need to work as much now as they did then. So that is another element in this whole thing, and one I would have hoped that you would have taken into account in your thinking. </para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things we keep hearing is that there have been fee increases of 20 per cent since 1995. That is untrue. It is based only on the small and more expensive community sector, and it is why you need competition in child care, like in other areas. There are other suppliers who are accredited and who charge lower fees than the more expensive community sector. One of the problems in my home state is that there was little competition for the community based sectors. In other states there were more suppliers. We all know that the fees are set by the child-care operators, not by the government. During the Labor years, the rate of fee increases was 8Â½ per cent per annum. Since we have been in government, fee increases have continued, but it is at four per cent per annum.</para><para>I have tried to get through to the ALP that a taxpayer on a low income with two children in full-time care has a subsidy from the taxpayer of $12,500. A pensioner earns $9,500. So that is what the taxpayer is paying to a family to use child care. And yet opposition members come in here and have the hide to say this government has not supported child-care assistance for Australia's families. That is the magnitude of the assistance that we ask of Australia's taxpayers. </para><para>I do not know how much more you need of this, but mothers are not dropping out of work due to rising child-care costs. Since June 1996 the participation rate of mothers with children under five has shown little changeâfrom 47.2 per cent to 47.1 per cent in June 1999. There is no evidence for media claims that mothers are reducing their hours of work.

I raise this topic firstly because I see the intimidation of a witness appearing before a Senate committee and its inquiry as an extremely serious matter. Secondly, given the importance of submissions to the inquiry into indigenous education, I believe that it is paramount that any witness to a Senate committee be able to provide any and all information that they wish to so that the best outcome can be achieved. The aim of public hearings of such committees is to find out why such problems exist and what has contributed to those problems and to lead to recommendations on the issue. Without the comments and submissions from people on the ground facing problems in indigenous education, the government cannot determine the best possible solution.</para></talk.start><para>Let me start by telling the story behind the intimidation of a witness that appeared before a Senate committee. On 26 July 1999 the employment committee held a public hearing in Brewarrina in New South Wales. The hearing was part of the committee's inquiry into indigenous education. On that day we heard from a number of witnesses, but this particular incident involved two people: Mr Peter Felsch, the general manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council and Tony Wiltshire, a youth and community development officer from the council. At the end of the hearing, Mr Wiltshire told the committee he wanted to give more evidence in camera. After discussing the request, the committee suggested that Mr Wiltshire present a written submission because of the time constraints the committee was under at that stage, having held the hearing in Brewarrina in the morning and needing to move on to the town of Bourke in the afternoon. </para><para>At the time the committee did not see any difficulties with the day's proceedings, and this is reflected in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. It turns out, though, that Mr Wiltshire later raised with the employment committee the matter he had found concerning about that day, and that matter was then brought to the attention of the President of the Senate. The day after the Brewarrina public hearing, Mr Wiltshire told the committee that he had been subject to intimidation following his giving of evidence and his plan to write a submission. It turns out that there was a disagreement between Mr Wiltshire and the Council General Manager, Mr Felsch, over the written submission. A debate erupted between the two over the status of the document: would it be written as a public representation of the council's view or would it be a private view? The committee notified Mr Wiltshire that he could write a private submission if he wanted. In a letter from Mr Felsch to Mr Wiltshire, the general manager said that any representation of the council had to be approved, given that Mr Wiltshire was an employee of the council. So Mr Wiltshire's submission would have to be checked over by Mr Felsch. He also informed Mr Wiltshire that he would be placed on probation for six months and would not be allowed to undertake certain roles that he had undertaken in the past. He urged Mr Wiltshire not to make a private submission because <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> had already recorded his concerns for the public record. He warned Mr Wiltshire that his position with the council was under review following an attempt to put a submission to the committee based on what Mr Felsch called `opinion and not fact'.</para><para>After receiving correspondence between the two men, the committee decided to take the matter to the President of the Senate and then later to the Committee of Privileges. The committee wrote to Mr Felsch on 2 August saying, and I quote from the Committee of Privileges report:</para><quote><para>It appears to the Committee, from reports given to it by Mr Wiltshire, that its public hearing in Brewarrina and the aftermath have occasioned behaviour by you that may be considered an intimidation of a witness.</para></quote><para>The employment committee informed both men of its decision to take the matter of possible intimidation of witnesses to the Committee of Privileges. After investigating the matter, the Committee of Privileges found that:</para><quote><para>... Mr Felsch, General Manager, Brewarrina Shire Council, improperly interfered with, and penalised, Mr Tony Wiltshire, then Youth and Community Development Officer, Brewarrina Shire Council, as a consequence of Mr Wiltshire's participation in the proceedings of the Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee before, during and after hearings held at Brewarrina ...</para><para>That Mr Felsch, as General Manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, had therefore committed a contempt of the Senate.</para></quote><para>The Committee of Privileges decided that no penalty be imposed because the matter had already cost the council financially and through the inquiry. Mr Felsch was found guilty of improperly interfering with and penalising Mr Wiltshire. Mr Wiltshire, the witness behind the intimidation by his superior, was also without a job not long after this incident. It is ironic that so much fuss was made by the general manager towards Mr Wiltshire's comments. If Mr Felsch had left Mr Wiltshire go about his submission, I seriously doubt it would have attracted so much attention.</para><para>My main concern here is with the intimidation of a witness and its effects. The whole system of public hearings within committees would fail if it were not for evidence given by public citizens. Witnesses must feel that they can speak frankly and honestly to a committee without the fear of persecution. All witnesses must have the right to express their views to such committees or an important element of our democratic process will be at risk. It was pointed out quite clearly to Mr Felsch that, if he did not want comments made by Mr Wiltshire to be considered those from the shire council, all that was needed was a statement by him on the record saying that Mr Wiltshire's views were his own and did not represent the council's. Mr Felsch acted irresponsibly towards a council employee who, being a youth development officer in the region, could have provided valuable information to the committee that was inquiring into indigenous education. In the area of indigenous education, it is vital that people working with young students report to the committee on the type of problems their region is facing. How can we improve the situation unless we know all the facts?  </para><para>In the case of Brewarrina in western New South Wales, black and white relations are not good. There are many social problems in the town. Local schools can almost be described as de facto apartheid schools, where a local primary school's indigenous population is, for example, 97 per cent. A large majority of non-Aboriginal students tend to go to the Catholic school outside the town. Problems faced by these towns include: attendance levelsâand this relates often to cultural factors; poor health, leading to ineffective learning; mainstream curriculums, without proper acknowledgment of indigenous culture; lack of indigenous teachers; and low levels of literacy and numeracy. </para><para>I do not know why Mr Felsch acted in the way he did, but it is not in the best interests of improving the standards of indigenous education if information is repressed. Such repression can result in the committee overlooking certain perspectives. I see this offence by Mr Felsch as being most serious. Mr Wiltshire was treated unfairly by a superior of the shire council, and I see threats against this man as being inexcusable. In no circumstances should a witness's employment be threatened by their giving evidence to a Senate inquiry. I find it intolerable that, even though the Committee of Privileges found Mr Felsch guilty and did not impose a penalty, Mr Felsch did not feel that he should make any reparations for his actions. I want to put on the record my total lack of respect for this general manager of a council who, despite being given a warning by the Committee of Privileges, found it necessary to pursue his own vindictive agenda against a witness who did the right thing in the public interest.</para><para>I welcome the findings by the Committee of Privileges, but this is a matter which should be taken further by the New South Wales Minister for Local Government. I will be writing to the minister to request that he take this matter further. No minister should feel comfortable with the fact that within his department there are people who intimidate, harass and force onto the dole people who are whistleblowers before a parliamentary inquiry. I call on the New South Wales local government minister to act on this matter. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Refugees: Kosovo</title><page.no>13731</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>13731</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to speak this evening on an issue that is of immediate importance to many people in the Australian community, and that is the plight faced by those refugees who were brought here from Kosovo by the Australian government last year whilst armed conflict was occurring in that country. As I have said many times during and since that occasion, it was a marvellous example and demonstration of the enormous degree of compassion within the Australian community and a perfect counter to those who might suggest that Australians are antagonistic towards refugees or people overseas who are in desperate need. It has been interesting to contrast the attitude and the flavour of the coverage of people in desperate need that was portrayed at the time of the Kosovo conflict with the attitude that was portrayed in relation to boat arrivals in Australia towards the end of last year. I think it highlights the immense influence that the portrayal of images and issues through the media can have on public opinion. That is not a way of trying to blame the media by any means. I think it highlights how important the leadership role of government is in issues such as this.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the situation with the Kosovo refugees, I do not think it is to unreasonable at all to suggest that the Australian government and the Prime Minister in particular felt compelled to act and to offer refuge to some people from Kosovo at the time of the conflict last year because of the immense strength of concern expressed by the Australian community through the demand that we do more to assist these people. It is a shame that some within the Australian government have sought to reshape public opinion towards refugees and people in need since that time by distorting the reality of the desperate situation faced by the many people who arrived here on boats towards the end of last year. But, focusing specifically on the immediate difficulties faced by those people from Kosovo who are remaining in Australia, we have an amazing situation where the Bandiana safe havenâas it was until yesterdayâhas overnight been relabelled and reclassified as the Bandiana detention centre. There is no better illustration of both the absurdity of this situation and the gross inhumanity of the situation than Australia, having brought these people to this country, offered them assistance and removed them from a situation of great peril, now relabelling the safe haven we offered them as a detention centre, as a place where illegal immigrants or unauthorised non-citizens, to use the legal jargon, are being detained until they can be forcibly removed from Australia at the first possible opportunity. </para><para>The legislation that was introduced by this government before it would allow people from Kosovo to be offered a haven in Australia was quite different in a few specific respects from the mechanisms that were used by other countries that offered safe haven outside of Europe. In particular, the US, Canada and New Zealand all offered havens to people from Kosovo without preventing them from exercising their rights to seek protection visasâto seek protection in those countries on a permanent basis using the mechanism for determining their refugees status in those countries. Yet Australia felt it necessary to pass unprecedented special legislation to apply to these people that removed all those rights from them. It removed their right to apply to have their status as refugees tested through the processes that we have established in Australia.</para><para>As senators would know, I have occasionally raised concerns about the adequacy of the process that we have in Australia for determining refugee status within the immigration department, through the Refugee Review Tribunal and through the very limited right of appeal that people currently have to the Federal Court and the High Courtâa limited right that the federal government is trying to curtail even further as we speakâplus the minister's discretion to review, a power that he is not compelled to use, which cannot be appealed against and is completely at his whim. Despite the potential inadequacies of that system, it has been completely denied to the people from Kosovo. It was a condition for them being allowed to come here in the first place that they would not have that right available to them.</para><para>To supposedly compensate for that, there was an aspect of the legislation where the minister had the power to restore that right for them to test their status as refugees or to apply for other visas in Australia, such as partner visas. That is better than nothing but unfortunately it leaves those people's futures completely at the whim of the minister, with no mechanism for appealing his decision on any of those issues and indeed no guidelines at all put in placeânot even internal, private, non-public guidelinesâthat the minister has to follow in making a decision in that regard. Indeed, in the legislation itself there is even an exemption for the minister from the requirement to follow natural justice in coming to any decision in relation to the fate of the people from Kosovo.</para><para>The obvious potential for decisions like that to be tainted by political considerations should be clear to all. That is why we have had an independent system of assessment through the Refugee Review Tribunal. Whether one wants to be critical of it or not, it is at least somewhat more independent than a decision made in the back room of the minister's office or somewhere where there is no public scrutiny, which is what we have for the people from Kosovo. The governmentâor the minister, more specificallyâhave said that they are following the recommendations from the UNHCR. That is obviously welcome. One could make comments about the desire of the government to use the United Nations committee in this regard, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as a cloak for justifying their actions while at the same time criticising a UN committee on human rights anytime it says something that the government disagree with. But that is perhaps a separate issue. </para><para>But it is worth while, given that the government has put so much store in the fact that it has taken account of the recommendations of the UNHCR, to highlight what they have actually provided to the government less than one month ago about the situation for Kosovo Albanians and their recommendations in regard to return. They specifically identified a number of individuals with ongoing protection needs, including persons or families of mixed ethnic origins, people associated with or perceived to have been associated with the Serbian regime after 1990 and people who refused to join or deserted from the Kosovo Liberation Army. Despite narrow perceptions in many parts of the world, there certainly was not universal support for the tactics or approach of the Kosovo Liberation Army, both before the war and certainly since. The list also included people who had been known to be outspokenly critical of the former KLA or people who had been known to refuse to follow laws and decrees of the former KLA. On top of that, the UNHCR specifically advised against the return of Kosovo Albanians to Serb dominated areas as it is neither safe nor sustainable. They set in place recommendations and factors that should be taken into account in deciding when to return Kosovo Albanians. These should include: the availability of adequate shelter for returnees; the accessibility of health, education and social services; access to income producing employment; and the security situation in the locale of return. </para><para>If the minister can guarantee that every one of those factors has been taken into account and not just ignored, and that every one of those factors has been assessed and recognised as to whether it has been met in relation to all the people the government is now trying to force to return to Kosovo against their will, then that would be a welcome guarantee. But the minister has certainly not come anywhere near making any guarantee along those lines. I think that highlights the inadequacies of the legislation the government insisted would be put in place before it would offer haven to people from Kosovo last year. It highlights the lack of accountability of the process and the fact that the whole future direction of the lives of these people who have been through so much trauma is completely out of their control and is totally in the hands of the minister, without any opportunity for appeal and without any opportunity for independent scrutiny of whether or not he has properly followed the recommendations from the UNHCR. Underpinning all that is whether or not Australia has indeed breached the fundamental human rights component of any piece of international law, which is not to return somebody to a place where they face a real possibility of persecution, torture or death. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Anzac Day</title><page.no>13733</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>13733</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs 25 April approaches, the thoughts of many of us turn once again to the commemoration of Anzac Day. Tonight I want to say just a few words about the Anzac tradition, with particular reference to the contribution of women. In commemorating Anzac Day we traditionally remember those men who fought and died on the shores of Gallipoli 85 years ago. We remember their extreme bravery, their heroic struggle and their eight long months of combat. We also remember their remarkable withdrawal, which allowed over 90,000 men to retreat to safety. But the great contribution that Australian women made during the First World War is also something that should be remembered. Whilst our men were fighting on the shores of Gallipoli, Australian nurses worked in Egypt and Lemnos. At least 2,139 served abroad during the war, with 29 dying in active service. </para></talk.start><para>However, when we speak about the Anzacs today it is not just the specific battle of Gallipoli we refer to but something much larger, and that is, I believe, the spirit and legend of all the men and women who have fought in Australia's name for our security and the protection of democracy. The Anzac spirit is about mateship, courage and strength in the face of adversity. It is about fighting for what you believe in side by side with your mates. It is about upholding ideals that we as Australians continue to embrace. The Anzac tradition grew out of the bravery and dedication of Australians in the face of open battle where trench warfare was the norm. However, since the end of the Second World War there has been a change in the nature of warfare. With the threat of nuclear weapons and advanced chemical weapons, the potential and often realised devastation of war is even greater than before. In the hope of avoiding another major world conflict, the emphasis has shifted to the need for collective security. The United Nations was created in 1945 partly for this purpose. Since then, we have seen an emphasis on peacekeeping, peacemaking and global security. The emphasis on peacekeeping has allowed women to take on a much greater role in securing peace around the world. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, spoke just last month about the contribution of women, saying that when ethnic tension and conflicts occur it is women who `build bridges and not walls'. </para><para>Considering that women are equally affected by war, it is appropriate that more become involved in the peacemaking process, both at a local level and by increasing the numbers of women being sent by participating states. The involvement of Australian women is ever increasing, with hundreds going off to East Timor last year. In fact, in the period 1998-99 Australia had the highest number of women in its armed forces as a percentage of the total, with 15.5 per cent of the Australian armed forces comprising women. This exceeds the involvement by women in the armed forces anywhere else in the Western world. Australian women have contributed to Australia's war effort since the Boer War. Their contribution has touched the lives of many Australian families in roles as varied as nursing, driving transports, being on the frontline and helping the war effort at home. In fact, in putting together a few notes for my words tonight, a young woman on my staff told me that her grandmother had served in the WAAF during the Second World War, with her aunt more recently serving in Australia's peacekeeping role in Cambodia. Australia now has a proud history of involvement in peacekeeping. We have participated in 18 United Nations and six other multinational operations. As a nation we are dedicated to the concepts of collective security, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and international peace. Of these missions, many have been in our own Asia-Pacific regionâfrom Indonesia to Korea and Cambodia. </para><para>In particular, in the year marking the 50th anniversary of Australia's commitment in Korea, it is interesting to reflect upon the significant role that Australian women played during that conflict. From working in support roles at home in the women's Air Force, Army and Navy corps to being posted to Korea or Japan, where they worked on trains, treating wounded soldiers who were on often long and painful journeys back to the medical base, Australian women were there. Their contribution was a significant one and we commend them, for their dedication was as great as the dedication of those who fought in battle.</para><para>Most recently, Australians, including a large number of women, became involved in Australia's troop commitment in East Timor. The coalition was pleased to respond to the request by the United Nations and our strategic allies to lead the combined peacekeeping force known as INTERFET. Under the inspired leadership of Major General Peter Cosgrove, 4,000 soldiers, including 863 women, were involved in the East Timor mission, assisting on the ground, in the air and in ships monitoring the surrounding seas. Women of the modern Australian armed forces work as truck drivers, intelligence officers, Black Hawk pilots and military police. In the role of military police, they have the task of investigating war crimes, running the militia detention centre and being bodyguards. This reflects a growing movement in our armed forces to encourage and promote the role of women. Not only are we seeing women taking up commanding positions but we have seen, on the initiative of Senator Jocelyn Newman, a removal of the restrictions which have barred women from taking on combat related duties. Despite the very serious nature of their mission in Timor and being potentially at risk from the militia on a number of occasions, Australian soldiers, both men and women, were often able to pacify the situation with the displays of friendship which were shown to the East Timorese during their mission. We all remember seeing Australian soldiers organising singalongs and games for those children who had to wait for hours in camps. It is moments such as these which show us that the Anzac spirit is still very much alive. </para><para>In the last 50 years, we have seen Australia's defence and leadership role in the region expand. This is occurring outside of our involvement with the United Nations as we set up regional security dialogues with China, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan. As an economically prosperous country with strong democratic traditions and a united and harmonious society, we should not be afraid to take on these responsibilities. As the remaining soldiers who fought at Gallipoli now number only two, our direct link with that battle is disappearing. But, even so, the spirit of those soldiers shall live on. Our Anzac forefathers and those who have fought Australian battles over the past century helped to create and protect our nation, as did the many women who have served in Australia's armed forces. We are proud of them, as we are proud of our present-day army. On Anzac Day, let us never forget the high price paid by so many in the quest for peace, and let us be thankful for the subsequent freedoms and liberties that we, as Australians, now enjoy as a result of their sacrifices.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Refugees: Kosovo</title><page.no>13735</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>13735</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI begin by commending Senator Coonan on that speech. `Lest we forget' is an oft-repeated phrase, but it is one that reminds us that if we ignore history we are often doomed to repeat it. It is probably an appropriate thing to remember, given the events of the last couple of weeks in particular. We have been talking about various injustices affecting people and generations, and Senator Coonan has referred to an issue that we often associate with a `lost generation'. We talk about people who gave their lives in the First World War, the Second World War and other wars as lost generations. It is a timely reminder of this issue, as we move to Anzac Day.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to speak very briefly tonight to reiterate some of the comments of my colleague Senator Bartlett and, more importantly, to get a couple of matters on record. It was important to the Democrats that, as members of parliament, we bore witness to the events of this weekend, specifically the deportation of the Kosovar refugees. I was in my home town of Adelaide. I went to the airport, along with a number of interested observers, friends and Red Cross officialsâindeed, there were also two DIMA officials, who were obviously there in their official capacity in relation to the deportation of these refugees. Obviously, there were many people who just happened to be at the airport but who came along to watch these people leave. I say `watch' for a number of reasons. We were interested to see how these people were treated, and we wanted to bear witness to the fact that they were leaving against their will. These refugees did not want to leave, nor should they have been made to leave.</para><para>On Sunday afternoon, we saw very moving scenes as three families departed South Australia. People were very upsetâclearly devastated. Some genuinely feared for their safety and, in a couple of circumstances, their lives. But, overall, I think some of them were exhausted. To understand why, you need to understand the events of the last 48 hours leading up to the departure for Sydney. On Saturday afternoon, those families were expecting to leave. They were expecting officials from the department to collect them from their homes to take them to the airport. They were expecting to catch a Qantas flight to Melbourne around 4 o'clock in the afternoon. About twenty minutes prior to the planned time of departure, the families were informed that they would not be going due to technical difficulties such as the plane not working or the charter not being organised. I am not quite sure exactly what the technical difficulties referred to were. But, nonetheless, it was difficult for these people, who were already traumatised at the thought of leaving.</para><para>They were told that they would have to pack up and be ready to leave first thing Sunday morningâby `first thing', people were anticipating a 6.05 a.m. flight out of Adelaide to Melbourne. They were informed around 2 a.m. that morning that they would not be going on that flight and that they would be informed later as to when they would depart Adelaide for, at that stage, Melbourne. Later on that morning, they were informed that indeed they would be going that afternoon. Instead of a Qantas flight, they went on an Ansett flight, in this case to Sydneyâand the rest people know about. The chartered flight obviously fell throughâthat is an inappropriate use of language in relation to aviation, I suspect. I believe a Sri Lankan flight was organised in order to take these people to, in some cases, quite unknown destinations in Kosovo. </para><para>It was a traumatic weekend. The process needs to be put on record because I think it added further to the suffering and the burdens that these people were experiencingâand not just the families but the people who had worked with them. The scenes at the airport were devastating. Not only were passers-by, media and a departmental official in tears, but also the families themselves were in tearsâfamilies who, in at least one or two circumstances, had been offered jobs, families whose stay was supported by the Premier of our state, families who were touted as great examples of this government's compassion and tolerance a year ago, families whose lives we have watched through our daily paper for many months as we have seen how they contributed to our community by paying taxes and working. In fact, in one case a man worked shifts which he knew he would not be paid for because he could not disrupt the maximum amount of hours he was allowed to work. These families became part of the state of South Australia and almost daily news. For that reason, it was understandable that people stood around quite upset. There were people in tears at the airport who had never met these people. When Sef Marino turned around to say goodbye after putting his ticket through the ticket machine and said, `Thank you, Australia,' despite the fact that he was leaving against his will and in fear for his family and his life, I don't think there was a dry eye in the house; nor should there have been. One lone protestor stood with a poster saying that she was ashamed of our government on that day. Many people, including one New Zealand woman who was passing by, could not believe it. She said, `Our country's not doing this. We're not sending them back. How could you?' </para><para>I ask why we have instigated the almost unprecedented immigration laws to which Senator Bartlett has referred. He has outlined the processes. On many occasions, dating back almost a year, he has outlined the Democrat position in relation to safe havens. He has outlined the farcical nature of changing a safe haven camp into a detention centre almost overnight. Those processes are clearly on record. Tonight I wish to put on record just how devastating those scenes were at the airport yesterday and how many lives were affectedânot just those families and the brave and clever officials from the Red Cross, from Legal Aid and the translators who helped out, but even the media, who had become good friends with many of these people. These people left against their will, and that is certainly something that should remain on the conscience of this government. I am saddened that there has been no reprieve offered to those people. Let us face it: there are exceptions. There is a small number of people who wish to stay and have good reason to stay, as Senator Bartlett outlined in relation to reports in the last two weeks which suggested that these people are not necessarily going back to a safe environment. I wish to place that on record, with great regret and shame at our government's actions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre</title><page.no>13736</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>13736</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I want to place on the record the wonderful achievement of the Sutherland Shire Council and many of its citizens with the establishment of the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre. This is a story of great significance for the shire because, over a number of years, many people have worked to establish what today is a unique arts and cultural centre for the people of southern Sydney.</para></talk.start><para>The story begins during World War II when a property in Gymea, a suburb of the shire, was purchased by Mr Ben Broadhurst. In 1946, Mr Broadhurst constructed a cottage on that property, together with some wonderful gardens. In 1976, Mr Ben Broadhurst and Hazel Broadhurst transferred their property to the Sutherland Shire Council as a gift, and a trust was established. A condition of that trust was that the property should be used for community facilities and that it be referred to in future as the Hazelhurst Retreat. In September 1994, the Sutherland Shire Council, under the wise guidance of the then Labor councillors, set up a subcommittee to manage the development of the site. It was proposed that a community arts centre and regional gallery be constructed on the site. Over a number of years, many people throughout the communityâmembers of the council, people who joined an organisation called Friends of Hazelhurstâas well as representatives of business in the shire worked towards establishing an arts centre and regional gallery. Support was forthcoming from the New South Wales government and the first stage of the project involved restoration of the cottage, which was opened in August 1997. That building on the site is used for a number of activities. In particular, very recently it was used for an exhibition of artworks that had been painted or produced by HSC students within the shire. </para><para>On 26 February this year, the regional gallery and arts centre on the property was officially opened by the mayor of the Sutherland shire. In attendance was the director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Mr Edmund Capon. In adding his comments to the opening, he reflected upon the fact that this is a unique facilityâthat this is not just an art gallery where people could come to see works of art but also a thriving arts centre. Edmund Capon referred to the fact that there are facilities there such as lecture theatres and workshops for budding and established artists throughout southern Sydney and the shire to come and not only display their works but also be involved in lecturing students and providing facilities and guidance for the various community arts groups within the shire.</para><para>I have to be a little bit political here. It was interesting that the representative of the Prime Minister on the occasion of the opening was Mr Bruce Baird, the member for Cook. Mr Baird reflected upon the support that the federal government and local Liberal members in the shire had given to this project. That was very interesting because those who know the real history of the development of this facilityâwhich runs into many millions of dollars raised over the years by the state government, by the council, by the local community and belatedly by the federal governmentâknow that at just about every stage along the way the whole proposition was opposed by the Liberal members of the Sutherland Shire Council and, indeed, by some of the local Liberal members themselves. We have learned in this place that it is not unusual for members of the coalitionâthe Liberal Party particularlyâto rewrite history, and this was another occasion. In any event, the fact that this facility has now been provided to the Sutherland Shire and the broader area of southern Sydney is a great achievement. It is unique; it is the only regional gallery in Australia that comprises both an art gallery and facilities for art students and members of community groups, et cetera, to utilise on those premises.</para><para>Within the shire we have some notable artists, and one of those is Mr George Gittoes. George Gittoes is a renowned Australian artist. Indeed, he was involved in the founding of The Yellow House with Martin Sharp back in the 1970s. In his illustrious career he has won the Wynne Prize and the Blake Prize and has achieved great fame both nationally and internationally for his work, particularly depicting industrial scenes and also for work with our overseas armed forces in peacekeeping missions. For a number of years, he was commissioned by the Australian Army to produce paintings and other works of art such as photography in areas where the Australian armed forces have operated in peacekeeping missions, such as in Somalia, Cambodia, Mozambique, the Middle East and Bosnia. George has a huge reputation and continues to make a major contribution to art within Australiaâso much so that this Friday an exhibition of his work, particularly reflecting the work he performed during his visits and assignments in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, South Africa, Northern Ireland and Somalia, will be opened at the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery in the Sutherland Shire. It is called <inline font-style="italic">World Diary</inline> by George Gittoes. Following that opening, it will be on tour throughout Australia.</para><para>Some may ask what all this has to do with the Senate. The important thing is that it is an example of where a community has struggled over many years not to build a nuclear reactor, not to build an airport, not to build or argue about a freeway but to build a unique cultural centre that will be of lasting benefit to hundreds of thousands of people in the Sutherland Shire in southern Sydney for many years. It will particularly be of benefit when it brings to a wider audience the great work of artists such as George Gittoes who, as I have said, has contributed much to reflecting our involvement in peacekeeping missions overseas and the great work done by our armed forces in that regard. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Anzacs and the Unknown Soldier</title><page.no>13738</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>13738</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn a farm out past Rosewood in the Lockyer Valley west of Brisbane, there is a small grove of poplar trees and nestled nearby is a bunch of wattle trees. Their golden brush stands out a mileâthough they look a little bit out of place among the dairy cattle that wander by. The grove of poplars was planted in 1915 by my mother's great-uncle Bill Barrett. Volunteering for the First World War, he told everyone that he wanted to leave something behind just in case he did not come back. But he did come back, and he died only a few years ago, one of the last diggers left from the Great War. The last thing he would ever have wanted to be described as was a hero. Like so many of his mates, he never expected much and, perhaps, by today's standards he did not get very much. In his diary he said, `No person is ever truly honoured for what they receive in life. Honour is the reward for what people give.' And Bill Barrett gave his all. I use this story as a backdrop to what I want to say this evening because I think we all need heroes and heroines in our lives. Heroes are very important because they show us what we are capable of. They stand for us. They represent our capacity to prevail. They defend us against our own tendency to be sucked down into despair, depression or even boredom. They raise our hopes and they raise our spirits. They open up new frontiers, even if only within our imagination. They inspire us.</para></talk.start><para>I remember recently watching Peter Luck's series on television called <inline font-style="italic">This Fabulous Century</inline>. He had an episode on heroes. While conceding that traditionally heroism is about war, he asked, `Who really remembers military heroes?' `In fact,' said Peter Luck, `our truly unforgettable heroes come from a variety of unsoldierly vocations, particularly sport and'âsorry, everyone!â`never politics.' First in Peter Luck's list was a horse, Phar Lap, an opera singer, Dame Nellie Melba, the great cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, the legendary aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and the famed Antarctic explorer Sir Donald Mawson. Peter Luck's list at least acknowledged that a worthwhile life and excellence can be achieved outside the sporting field. But even Peter Luck's list painfully lacked what I consider to be the essence of heroism and of a heroic contribution to society: the ideas of civic achievement, and inspiration born of personal sacrifice and courage in the face of even overwhelming odds. I believe that there is somebody who deserves the laurels of Australia's national hero. I believe this somebody is the Unknown Soldier. The Unknown Soldier embodies all those things we Australians see as being best about us: selflessness, sacrifice, courage in the face of adversity, loyalty, be it to his mates or his country, and a stoic attitude to life and its hardships. The Unknown Soldier did not play rugby or cricket for Australia. He was not a rock star. His importance lies in the fact that anyone might have been the Unknown Soldier. He is one of us.</para><para>His story is sad but it inspires us. Let me briefly share it with you. Some time after the armistice of 11 November 1918, bits of a body identifiable as Australian by his equipmentâmaybe boots, badges or shreds of uniformâwere put into a grave near Villers-Brettoneux in France in one of the many cemeteries created by the Imperial War Graves Commission, with a headstone inscribed `An Australian soldier of the Great War known to God'. In November 1993, whatever remained of the man's body was dug up, sealed into a Tasmanian blackwood coffin, flown by Qantas to Sydney and the RAAF to Canberra, exhibited in the Kings Hall of the Old Parliament House, then drawn on a gun carriage across Kings Avenue bridge and up Anzac Parade in a ceremony modelled on the funeral of a field marshal, and then carried to the cloisters to be buried at the centre of the Australian War Memorial's Hall of Memory. Seventy-five years to the day after the guns of the Great War went silent, a firing party on the parapet signalled that the coffin was being lowered into the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. A Great War veteran helped by a young soldier dropped into the tomb pieces of soil from Pozieres, France. Fifty thousand people filed through the hall in the next three days, depositing their own flowers and messages before the tomb was sealed by marble slabs. </para><para>Of course, all great traditions look back, but they must also show the way forward. The great achievement of the Unknown Soldier and the Anzacs is that the sentiment that emerged from Gallipoli, the Western Front and the Middle East in the First World War does live on. Our nation has not forgotten. I am quite certain that the tradition of Anzac will inspire and unite us through our new century no less than it has in the past. Celebrations every year testify to the strength of the Gallipoli legend as the building block of our Australian nationhood. They also testify that, in the world of `15 seconds of fame', there is still hope that something more lasting and worth while can capture our hearts and stimulate our minds. The true beauty of `hero' is that it is an equal opportunity calling. Heroes have generally been regarded as remarkable people who do remarkable things. Not so with the Anzacs and not so with the Unknown Soldier. Their true greatness lies in their message that ordinary people can make the rest of us all feel more remarkable, to encourage us to share in their achievements, their challenges and their triumphs.</para><para>The Anzacs teach us other important lessons. In today's outcome oriented world, the status of a hero more often than not is dependent on winning, be it a trophy, a number one or a high ranking. What the Anzacs show us is that heroism lies not so much in the outcome as in the performance. You can lose but you can still be a hero. This is what the Anzacs showed to us and to the world. I think it was only when I read the great historian Bill Gammage's work on the Anzacs that I started to understand the meaning of `hero' and the meaning of sacrificeâthat I started to understand my great-uncle Bill Barrett. As Bill Gammage says, the Anzac legacy can teach us that how we live truly matters. Men and women may be frail, but their example can inspire their fellows and set standards and ideals for them to follow. For while individuals must suffer doubt and trouble all their days, those who conduct themselves well pass on a torch to all generations showing the human spirit shining and unquenchable, forever.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nursing Homes: Young Disabled People</title><page.no>13739</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>13739</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to speak, once again, about the failure of the federal and state governments to address the serious problem of accommodating young people with disabilities, particularly with acquired brain impairment, or ABI, in nursing homes. A week ago a rally was organised in Melbourne by Headway, a group which is campaigning to have young people who are affected by ABI taken out of nursing homes and provided with care that better suits their needsâhoused, I might say, with people much closer to their own age.</para></talk.start><para>It was disappointing that the message to the rally from the state minister was that the state government recognised the problem but had not yet developed a plan to address it and that state ministers for disabilities would soon be getting together and this issue would be on the agenda. The message from Minister Bishop was that the issue of young people in nursing homes was essentially a state responsibility and that the recent increase in aged care funding and the Commonwealth's $150 million offer in disability services ought to assist in developing a solution. I hope it does, but we have seen very little progress so far. I think that the families of these young people in nursing homes who were at the rally last week had every reason to be disappointed by those responses. The figures supplied by the federal government suggest that there are some 1,100 people under 65 in nursing homes, many of whom have ABI. However, according to the study undertaken by the Australian Institute of Welfare Studies in June 1998, that figure is closer to 6,000. They say there are 160,000 people with a disability related to acquired brain injury in this country.</para><para>The vast majority of nursing homes are quite unsuitable for younger people. They are often places where very frail people live out their last few months of life or where dementia is a common condition. One speaker described his experience of living for four years in nursing homes where the screaming at night and the smell of faeces and urine made the experience almost unbearable. He was highly critical of this nursing home. He was refused analgesics, dressings for burns were not changed regularly, he was often kept waiting for assistance with toileting, staff were rude and abrupt and drugs were incorrectly administered. He said that rough and careless treatment caused him much physical pain. He said, `I couldn't even begin to describe the horror of living at close quarters with people who have lost control of their minds and bodies whilst at the same time suffering the disinterest of administration and cruelty of staff.' His cognitive ability slowly returned, despite the conditions in which he was living. He recovered to a point where, although now in a wheelchair and with only a very limited capacity to use one arm, he has been able to return to teaching mathematics and science. I might add that he is not being paid for his work even though the school that he works in acknowledges that his work with individual students is very valuable. </para><para>In some ways this man is fortunate. Many others with ABI linger on in nursing homes with very little hope of progress. In Victoria, my home state, the Melbourne City Mission northern case management service for people with ABI has been going for the past six years. It estimates that only around five per cent of people with ABI are receiving case management support. It says that cognitive impairment is generally overlooked. Children generally miss out altogether on case management support unless they have a physical disability or are referred by hospital staff. The state government funds a Making the Difference program, but in one area only six children are involved and none are on the list in another area. Brain injured children are not even allocated disability criteria when applying for teacher aid assistance in Victorian schools.</para><para>For traffic related injury, the Traffic Accident Commission provides all of life support, from the time of the road accident or as the person needs it. But there is little support available for others. Other than what is provided through linkages and alcohol and drug programs, the Melbourne City Mission is the only organisation providing case management for people with ABI that is not traffic related. Some limited services are provided through Health and Community Care, but it should be noted that there is an average 18-month wait to access this service.</para><para>Twenty-five of the current 84 clients within the Melbourne City Mission's ABI service are under the age of 65 and living in nursing homes. Late last year the Melbourne City Mission group conducted a study into the accommodation needs and options for young people with high support needs and the appropriateness of accommodating them in nursing homes. Some of the things this study established as important when caring for young people with ABI were access to acute care, a team approach and provision of qualified and experienced nursing staff. Access to funding for rehabilitation and ongoing support through the Victorian Department of Human Services' Slow to Recover/Long-term Maintenance program was also said to be necessary because many people with ABI continue to heal slowly over many years. The involvement of family and friends in service reviews is also very important. Of course, very few aged care facilities can offer these services. For some reason many residents with ABI do not have social workers or case managers.</para><para>The Melbourne City Mission study also revealed that, regardless of the standard of care received in nursing homes, young people with significant cognitive impairment and associated physical disabilities have relatively few opportunities to participate in or be integrated into the community. They have limited choices about how they live their daily lives and many suffer loss of privacy and dignity. They are isolated by age from the predominate group of residents with very little opportunity to access necessary ongoing rehabilitation or recreational activities suitable for their age group.</para><para>Melbourne City Mission did identify some models within nursing homes that are better at meeting the needs of young people. One of those was accommodation in a separate wing of a nursing home and others were based on smaller units integrated into the community. They suggest that four pilot accommodation projects for people needing different levels of care be developed using a combination of Commonwealth, state and private funding. The first would be a group home or accommodation facility in an inner urban region housing up to five young people with very high nursing needs. The second would be a hostel, based in the southern suburbs, accommodating 12 young people with lower level nursing needs. The third would be a specialist unit for 10 people with challenging behaviours based in the eastern suburbs. The fourth option was for 20 individualised packages as a state-wide initiative allowing young people to continue to live in community settings or in their own homes. Each of the four service delivery models would give equal emphasis to the three identified key service model components, which are provision of care, living arrangements and support systems. </para><para>All service models developed would include research and education and be rigorously evaluated with a view to expansion and replication. The Traffic Accident Commission and Victorian Workcover could be expected to provide funding to supplement state and federal money. I would urge federal and state governments to look seriously at providing funding for these pilot projects.</para><para>In 1995 the Western Australian government commenced its Young People in Nursing Homes Project. However, this project will cease later this year. The project was achieved via the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement by closing 95 nursing home beds and transferring the funding to community based accommodation for young people with ABI or lower motor neurone disease. Capital funding was made available through Homewest and the health department to provide buildings and therapeutic equipment. A number of interagency committees coordinated the project, which has developed a range of accommodation options.</para><para>There are three purpose-built houses in different sites for people with cerebral palsy, and a series of small units accommodating people with Huntington's disease. The Western Australian project has managed to move 95 people out of nursing homes. Some clients will actually go back into the wider community with support services. This will of course free up places for the frail aged entering nursing homes. The whole notion of this project is to move people through the system. They are rehabilitation based as opposed to maintenance based typical of nursing home care. The people involved in this project will continue living in the accommodation provided, which will be supported by continued funding. I was not able to find out what will happen to the 20 young people a year who enter Western Australian nursing homes when the funding for this project ceases. Like so many good initiatives, governments like to close them down so that they can announce a brand new scheme down the track.</para><para>The Western Australian project and the Melbourne City Mission are offering alternatives to nursing home accommodation for young people with acquired brain injury. I urge the government to note these alternatives and to make sure that they are included when next drawing up the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. The Department of Health and Aged Care's policy says that nursing homes for young people should only be used if, and only if, they need the intensity, type and model of care provided in such facilities and no other more appropriate service is available. The policy acknowledges that nursing homes rarely, if ever, enhance the qualityâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Water</title><page.no>13741</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>13741</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the new `gold' of the twenty-first century: waterâthe basic source of life, settlement and civilisation. World history will bear out this grandiose statement. Last month in my state of Victoria, the importance of this natural resource was elevated to international concern at the World Water Congress held in Melbourne by the International Water Resources Association. The association was founded as an international forum to promote communication and cooperation in water related areas. Two of the principal objectives of the IWRA are (1) advancement of water resources planning, management, development, technology, research and education at international, regional and national levels and (2) establishment of a multidisciplinary forum for engineers, planners, administrators, managers, scientists, educators and others who are interested in water resources. </para></talk.start><para>Awareness of global water concerns has been discussed and debated in several forums around the world. At the intergovernmental level it is being promoted internationally through the United Nations. International awareness has reached a high level of importance, particularly towards water security in Africa. In Australia the same is so. While it can be said that we have always been aware of the need for water conservation and securityâlook at the Snowy Mountain scheme built in the fiftiesâthe difference now is that, after centuries of land use with ever increasing intensive farming, along with an increasing population, we have today reached a point where our water resources are under stress, which is further exacerbated by frequent droughts.</para><para>As a whole, our infrastructure has not kept up with demand for water. For example, in Victoria, we are only now completing the final stages of the Mallee pipeline. It is worth while to reflect upon the Wimmera-Mallee water supply system as a case in point. The Wimmera-Mallee water supply system is almost a century old and the largest of its type in the world. Essentially, the system provides water for farms and towns through 16,000 kilometres of open channels. But here is the point: there are water losses as high as 80 per cent in some areas. Replacing the open channels in stages with pipes has created a dramatic water saving; however, the work is expensive and yet to be completed. Another case in point is the Great Artesian Basin in Queensland, which covers 20 per cent of Australia. A great deal of the water extracted from the basin has been wasted over the past century because of uncapped bores that have been allowed to flow endlessly. In some cases, bores have been left flowing when the area or the cattle station is no longer inhabited. Current water extraction rates are in excess of recharge rates. It has been only in the past few years that action has been taken to cap the unused bores and to replace open drains with pipe systems. However, again because of the cost, this is being undertaken in stages.</para><para>The main focus of the nation's present and future water conservation concerns is the Murray Darling Basin. The reason is self-evident: it is amongst the world's biggest basins. It is in fact an area the size of France. It has 23 river systems and 65 dams. It receives four per cent of the continent's run-off but provides about 75 per cent of all the water consumed by Australians. On average, 81 per cent of the basin's water is diverted, and more than 95 per cent of that is used for irrigation. It supports agriculture worth $8.5 billion, including irrigated agriculture worth $3 billion, such as the water hungry crops of cotton and rice.</para><para>Adelaide gets half of its drinking water and significant tourism revenue from the Murray River. The Murray Darling Basin has become so seriously degraded that future production is under threat, not least to say that the Adelaide drinking water is certainly not up to standard. More than half of the river is suffering rising salinity levels. Salt levels in the lower reaches have at times exceeded acceptable levels. Water tables in the intensively irrigated areas are rising. Eventually, all the irrigation areas in the southern basin will have high water tables. A recently concluded freshwater fish survey, the most comprehensive undertaken, did not find a single Murray cod in the Murray River system. The researchers found that the system was overrun with introduced carp, which are killing off other species and muddying and polluting the Murray River. The importance of this study is that fish are an excellent indicator of river health. Poor quality water or reliability is bad business for thousands of farmers relying on the Murray Darling River system. The only way to ensure good quality water and reliability in the future is to ensure quality environmental outcomes.</para><para>The difficulty lies in bringing a balance between productive use of the resource and environmental use. History shows that there </para><para>has been a greater weight placed on the productive sector use of the water system over the environmental use. That balance needs to be constantly adjusted according to the circumstances, which, in short, means that some hard-nosed reform is ahead of us. However, the difficulties of reform pale into insignificance when compared with the environmental and economic collapse affecting all of us, unless change is implemented soon. With regard to the Murray Darling Basin, the Murray Darling Basin Commission is the organisation delegated to plan, reform and implement it. The action that needs to be taken is well known and has been well researched. In short, they know what they must do. The difficulties are the competing interests, given that there are no less than four states involved in the basinâreforms such as water restrictions, controlled use, tree planting, closing of drains, piping water and storage, and even land grading. </para><para>Generally speaking, the strategies to tackle salinity problems and blue-green algae are in place, but they are not keeping pace with the problems. The state and federal governments are well aware of the mounting problems and have introduced water reforms to meet the future challenge. For example, in Victoria the previous state government amalgamated and increased commercial management of the myriad state water authorities. The benefits were almost immediate, with improved efficiency and service of the boards as well the achievement of target water and effluent quality standards. This has been possible through economies of scale created by the amalgamations.</para><para>In the federal sphere, the government has dedicated extra funds to salinity projects such as wetland management and to blue-green algae through the Murray Darling Basin Commission, and of course through the Natural Heritage Trust. Nevertheless, the solution relies not only upon a dedicated strategy accepted by all and implemented over the next decade. Above all, it requires an enormousamount of funds. The key to it all is possibly an amount of up $5 billion, plus. This is an enormous strain on the federal budget. To be able to source this money without going further into debt or erasing the surplus, the only available funds seem to be through the further sale of Telstra, estimated to be worth some $50 billion. The sale of Telstra will have the advantage of maintaining the government's budget surplus, reducing the government debt to zero and turning the $7 billion worth of interest payments back into the budget. Most importantly, the sale will provide a once in a lifetime fund to resolve Australia's grave water concerns. Australia cannot just continue to work at the edges in resolving its growing water resources problems. The challenge is to deal with our environment of droughts, floods and a population concentration around our two major river systems. I am convinced that we have the plan to put in place, but we now need to back it up with popular support and acceptance and to divert large sums of government funds towards resolving the issue. I accept that there are strong and genuine views held in relation to the sale of Telstra, but the question has to be answered: where is the money going to come from?</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>13743</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.05 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>13743</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>13743</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry ActâAustralian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Repeal Order 2000 (No. 1).</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâInstruments Nos CASA 113/00 and CASA 119/00.</para><para>Higher Education Funding ActâDetermination under section 15âDetermination No. T21 of 1999.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew ActâDispensation granted under section 20âDispensation  No. 5/000.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>13744</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Norfolk Island: Aerodrome</title><page.no>13744</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1262)</subtitle><id.no>1262</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>13744</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1999:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Does Norfolk Island have only one aerodrome.</para><para>(2) Are the nearest alternative aerodromes to Norfolk Island 431 nautical miles and 591 nautical miles from the island.</para><para>(3) Could a Fokker F28MK4000 or a Fokker F28MK0100 safely reach either of the above alternative aerodromes within 75 minutes at single engine cruising speed.</para><para>(4) Have the Fokker F28MK4000 and the Fokker F28MK0100 been assessed as unsafe for extended range operations greater than 75 minutes at single engine cruising speed; if so: (a) who made that assessment; and (b) has that assessment been endorsed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA); if not: (a) what is the maximum extended range operations of the above aircraft at single engine cruising speed; (b) how was the safe range determined; (c) who determined the safe range at single engine cruising speed; and (d) has that assessment been endorsed by CASA.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>13744</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has provided the following information:</para><para>(1) Norfolk Island has one licensed aerodrome.</para><para>(2) The nearest alternative aerodromes that can be used are Tontouta (431nm) and Auckland (590nm).

In 2000, the Commonwealth will provide an additional $18.7 million annually to State and Territory government and non-government education authorities to help schools and students in rural and geographically isolated areas of Australia. These education authorities have the flexibility to allocate CAP funds according to the priorities identified by them, utilizing their knowledge of local need, provided they comply with CAP guidelines. </para><para>(2) CAP aims to ensure that primary and secondary students in rural and geographically isolated areas continue to have access to education which will assist them to achieve outcomes at least equal to students in urban or less isolated areas.

These education authorities have the flexibility to allocate CAP funds according to the priorities identified by them, utilising their knowledge of local need, provided they comply with CAP guidelines. Schools are advised of their funding allocation by their education authority.</para><para>(6) CAP funds are allocated to education authorities based on the utilisation of an allocative mechanism which includes student numbers in small settlements (population centres of less than 1000 and less than 5000) and student remoteness distances of 100 km to 150 km and 150 km from a larger centre of 10000 people). This allocative mechanism was updated to include the most recent ABS Census data in 1997 and in 1999. It will be updated further following the release of the next ABS Census data. The education authorities have the flexibility to allocate CAP funds according to the priorities identified by them, utilizing their knowledge of local need, provided they comply with CAP guidelines. The method of allocating funds to schools may vary, some education authorities require schools to present submissions and other authorities allocate funds according to a distance index enabling individual schools to decide how funds are to be distributed. The Commonwealth does not require advice of schools receiving funding under CAP.</para><para>EDUCATION CENTRES</para><para>(1) Funding under the grant for the Australian Council of Education Centres (ACEC) is provided from the Quality Outcomes Programme and the Literacy and Numeracy Programme.
