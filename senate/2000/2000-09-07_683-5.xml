The bill establishes the framework for setting national standards.  The second step will be the progressive setting of standards for a range of fuels that are used in Australia.  The first standards, for petrol and automotive diesel, will be on the books shortly after this bill is enacted.</para><para>This is important legislation for Australia.  The enactment of the Fuel Quality Standards Bill 2000 will permit the first mandatory, national fuel quality standards for Australia. Standards do exist already. However, they are not mandatory or seriously monitored, and, in the case of petrol, they have not been reviewed in 10 years. If Australia is to reap the environmental benefits of evolving emission control and fuel efficiency technologies, fuel standards need to keep pace with vehicle standards.</para><para>This legislation arose from commitments, which were made by the Prime Minister as part of the Measures for a Better Environment (MBE) component of the new tax system.  In May 1999, the Prime Minister announced a package of incentives to encourage the switch to lower sulfur diesel fuels, and to facilitate the harmonisation of diesel vehicle emission standards with international standards.  The package also included a commitment to bring forward the introduction of new petrol vehicle standards.  Changes to petrol standards would also be needed, to support new engine technology.</para><para>Changes to fuel quality to support new emission standards are only a part of the story, however.  The Commonwealth commissioned a review of the fuel quality requirements for Australian transport to assess the benefits to be gained by introducing fuel quality standards.  The Fuel Quality Review took a number of fuel quality scenarios and modelled the changes in emissions of pollutants, air toxics and greenhouse gases from 2000 to 2010 and 2020. </para><para>In short, the Review found that the combined effect of cleaner fuel and the progressive tightening of vehicle emission standards would produce dramatic reductions in emissions of pollutants and air toxics from vehicles, over time.  </para><para>This legislation does not take Australia out on a limb.  Australia's move towards higher quality fuel is part of a global push for cleaner, more efficient transport. The findings of the Fuel Quality Review only reinforced the Government's commitment to achieve Prime Minister John Howard's goal of harmonisation of Australian vehicle emission standards with international standards by 2006. </para><para>It is pleasing to be able to say that Australia has relatively good air quality on average, even in our major cities.  This is, however, no reason for complacency.  We have episodes where levels of pollutants in the major eastern cities and Perth exceed pollutant levels in London, Toronto and similar cities.  If we are to meet the air quality standards specified in the National Environment Protection Measure for ambient air quality, particularly the ozone standard, we need to address motor vehicle emissions.</para><para>The Fuel Quality Standards legislation is also intended to assist with the abatement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.  It is now widely recognised that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming, with serious long-term and worldwide implications for urban and rural infrastructure, health, land management and agriculture.  Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Government has a target of limiting Australian greenhouse emissions to 8% above 1990 levels by 2008-2012  - this represents a 30% reduction against current business as usual projections for 2008-2012.  By 1998, the transport sector was responsible for about 16% (72.6 million tonnes) of total greenhouse gas emissions, of which about 89% of emissions were from road transport.  Projections indicate that, without significant and sustained abatement measures, transport emissions will increase by 50% (to 110 million tonnes) of 1990 levels by 2015.  This is of serious concern to the Government.  </para><para>Although the task of reducing greenhouse emissions from road transport is difficult, particularly in view of Australia's high dependence on motor vehicle transport, it is one that the Government is tackling through a package of strategic measures.  One element of our approach is to improve the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles.  The Fuel Quality Standards legislation will pave the way for ensuring the provision nationwide of cleaner fuels that not only reduce air pollution but also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles.  Legislated fuel quality enhancements, such as higher octane and lower sulfur content, will provide the certainty required for the deployment of advanced engine and vehicle technologies by automotive manufacturers and their uptake by consumers.  Advanced engine technologies will result in improved fuel consumption, which in turn will translate to greenhouse benefits.  The Fuel Quality Standards legislation will help realise the maximum potential greenhouse benefit from fuel use in vehicles by complementing fuel quality and vehicle technology.  </para><para>Further, this bill provides the framework for determining the fuel specifications of alternative and renewable fuels, thereby paving the way for these fuels to take a bigger share of the transport task in the future.</para><para>Alternative transport fuels, or fuels beyond the traditional petrol and diesel, are a major priority of this Government.  This is reflected in the Renewable Energy Action Agenda launched in June this year, which includes an initiative to promote the development of the renewable transport fuel industry.  In recognition of the important role that alternative and renewable transport fuels will play in minimising the greenhouse impacts of the transport sector, this Government has provided unprecedented funding for the uptake of these fuels.  The Measures for a Better Environment Statement provided $75 million for the Alternative Fuel Conversion Program over four years, and $9 million for alternative fuels under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme in 2000-01, increasing to $12 million in 2001-02.</para><para>The focus of fuel quality initiatives needs to be broadened to cater for the changes occurring in fuel use.  While we are promoting alternative transport fuels for the benefits they have in terms of the common pollutant and greenhouse emissions, we do not want to create alternative pollution problems. This legislation provides a robust framework on which future fuels - whatever their properties, source or mix - can be regulated in a manner that promotes vehicle safety and performance and benefits the environment.</para><para>While the main driver for the legislation is to achieve improvements in air quality by reducing pollution from motor vehicle use, the legislation will also enable the Commonwealth to achieve a number of other objectives. </para><para>The objects of the bill spell out the intention to enable the effective operation of engines.  During the public consultations on setting petrol and diesel fuel standards, stake-holders have repeatedly called for standards to ensure that fuel sold in Australia is safe and suitable for vehicles.</para><para>Following the finalisation of petrol and diesel standards with an `environmental' focus, the next priority will be to include standards relating to the operability of vehicles using these fuels.</para><para>The Fuel Quality Standards bill is not intended to address consumer protection as such, although it does include substantial penalty provisions. For example:</para><para>the bill creates two fault element offences, punishable by up to 500 penalty units for an individual and 2500 penalty units for a corporation, for the supply of fuel that does not meet a relevant standard under the Act;</para><para>the bill creates a fault element offence prohibiting the alteration of fuel covered by a standard. This carries a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units for an individual and 2500 penalty units for a corporation;</para><para>the bill creates two fault element offences concerning the supply and import of prohibited fuel additives. These carry a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units for an individual and 2500 penalty units for a corporation; and</para><para>a failure to provide documentation certification that fuel being on-supplied complies with relevant fuel standards carries a maximum penalty of 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 penalty units for a corporation. </para><para>These offences and significant penalties are consistent with Commonwealth criminal law policy and are entirely justified by the adverse effects of motor vehicle emissions on urban air quality, human health and enhanced greenhouse effect. </para><para>Most recent cases of large-scale fuel adulteration have been about excise evasion or cost cutting, and there is legislation in place to address tax evasion. The Fuel Quality Standards legislation will, when it commences, provide an additional means to address deliberate or reckless supply of fuel that does not meet the standards.</para><para>Clearly the Commonwealth legislation is limited in scope.  Constitutionally, the Commonwealth has no direct control of fuels.  The focus of this legislation is therefore on corporations who supply fuel in Australia, whether importers or producers.  This will capture the bulk of fuel sold in Australia.  </para><para>Our next step will be to work with the States and Territories.  The national standards will provide a benchmark for fuel quality, a starting point from which State consumer protection agencies can work. The Commonwealth will continue to involve the States in the development of fuel standards with a view to achieving a seamless national regime.</para><para>Vehicle manufacturers and refineries have been generally enthusiastic about creating single, uniform national standards.  They have legitimate concerns about the potential compliance costs if different standards proliferate in the absence of national fuel standards. </para><para>Some states have, or are in the process of developing state regulations for petrol and diesel.  This is a positive step, and has benefits as an interim measure leading up to the commencement of the Commonwealth standards.  The vehicle and fuel markets are, however, essentially national. There should be no uncertainty about when a standard applies. It is also irrational for refineries to produce differently for different states, unless there is a strong justification.</para><para>The bill is therefore intended to override a State standard on the same matter.  The Commonwealth recognises that there may be circumstances in which a more stringent standard is desirable for a particular area.  For example, elevated levels of a particular pollutant which threaten environmental or health quality may be best addressed through a stricter fuel standard.  The process for setting such an area-specific standard must, however, be objective and transparent.  The bill provides for this by permitting standards to apply differentially, provided they do not breach the Australian Constitution by discriminating in favour of a region, or impeding interstate trade.  Under the bill, the Minister responsible would be required to publish guidelines to be followed in making such a standard.  </para><para>The bill creates a consultative committee made up of representatives of each State and Territory, the Commonwealth, fuel industry representatives, environment and consumer representatives.  The Minister may add further members as there is a need, for example to cover the interests linked to a type of fuel being regulated.</para><para>The Committee will advise the Minister before he or she creates a standard.  This mechanism will ensure that the Minister has available to him/her the views of the major stakeholders.</para><para>The Fuel Quality Standards Bill has been drafted with the intention of providing the flexibility necessary to address fuel quality issues arising in relation to any fuel supplied in Australia, for any use.  Fuels used in road transport are the obvious initial target, because of the significant role that vehicle emissions play as a source of pollution, and the increasing concern that fuels are available which don't meet the operational requirements of vehicles. The legislation has the potential, however, to be used to manage the environmental, health or performance characteristics of fuels used for domestic, marine, industrial or other purposes.    </para><para>This will be the first national legislation designed to make fuel suppliers legally responsible for the quality of fuel that they provide.</para><para>The new fuels legislation should not be considered as a measure being taken in isolation from the Government's industry policy objectives as they relate to the refining sector.  Rather, it provides a mechanism for continuing the move to cleaner fuels that the industry itself recognises as necessary and to which it has already begun to contribute.</para><para>The Downstream Petroleum Products Action Agenda launched last November by Senator Minchin, has as its vision a strong and efficient refining industry that is environmentally responsible and supplies the majority of the nations refined petroleum product needs.  This legislation is consistent with that vision.</para><para>In the process of delivering Australians cleaner fuels it is important, however, to ensure that the refining sector is provided with sufficient options to restructure their activities.  The provision of flexibility in the transition to mandated fuel standards is therefore being given careful consideration in the standard setting consultative process currently under way for petrol and automotive diesel. </para><para>The Government wants to have a local refining industry that can supply high quality, clean fuels to Australia at the lowest possible cost.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><quote><para>Passage of the Fuel Quality Standards Bill 2000 will play a significant role in giving effect to the Government's commitment to improve the environmental and greenhouse performance of the transport sector. </para><para>The bill will allow the Commonwealth to set the benchmark for fuel quality in Australia, and provide national leadership as fuel quality issues emerge.</para><para>Passage of the bill will also remove uncertainty, equity and trade concerns that may arise from different fuel standards applying in different States.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2000 summer sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL THREATENED SPECIES DAY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>17530</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes that:</para><para>	(i)	7 September is National Threatened Species Day;</para><para>	(ii)	the new <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</inline> provides significantly enhanced powers to the Minister for the En-viron-ment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to protect threatened species, and</para><para>	(iii)	six categories of species are now listed in the Act in line with IUCN categories, which include: extinct, ex-tinct in the wild, critically en-dan-gered, endangered, vulnerable, and con-servation dependent;

The new innovation patent system will provide a more accessible and effective protection for lower level or incremental inventions.</para><para>This bill also meets two further objectives.  The first is to facilitate streamlining the mechanisms available for payment of fees under the Patents Act and the second is to provide a number of minor amendments to correct unintended ambiguities in the Patents Act.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">The innovation patent</inline></para><quote><para>In 1979 the Government introduced the petty patent system to assist Australian small to medium business enterprises.  The Government intended the system to provide a quicker and cheaper form of patent right for inventions with a short commercial life.  However the petty patent system has had limited success in meeting its objectives and has not been well used.</para><para>In 1994 the Government commissioned the Advisory Council on Industrial Property (ACIP) to conduct a review of the Australian patent system.  The objective of the review was to assess the coverage provided by Australia's current intellectual property regimes for incremental and lower level inventions.</para><para>ACIP's report <inline font-style="italic">Review of the Petty Patent System</inline> was released in August 1995.  The review identified a `gap' in the protection provided by current intellectual property regimes.  This `gap' related to incremental innovations that did not meet the inventive threshold requirements of the current standard or petty patent systems and were not appropriate for protection under the registered designs system.  Many of the innovations developed by small to medium business enterprises fall within this gap.  These innovations are often directed at improving, adapting and refining existing technology and although they may not represent major inventive advances they do have commercial value and play an important part in the commercialisation and application of technology.</para><para>In addition, although a single innovation may not equate to a significant inventive advance, over time a series of innovations may comprise the essential steps culminating in a major breakthrough.  A system that protects lower level inven-tions enables small and medium business enterprises to realise the value of their contributions in an on-going inventive process and also rewards innovative developments as they occur, without imposing the long lead-times often associated with major breakthroughs.</para><para>The ACIP report recommended the implementation of a new “second tier” patent system to fill the `gap' in current intellectual property protection regimes.  Following consultation with a range of stakeholders, including the business community and professional groups, ACIP recommended the introduction of the innovation patent system. </para><para>The Government has acted on these recommendations and devised a “second tier” patent system to better address the needs of business, particularly small to medium enterprises.  The innovation patent will be relatively inexpensive, quick and easy to obtain.  It will provide the same scope of protection as the standard patent, however it will require a lower inventive threshold than that required for a standard or a petty patent.  An innovation patent will have a maximum patent term of eight years, compared to a twenty year term for a standard patent.</para><para>A major factor contributing to the reduced cost of obtaining an innovation patent will be the grant of a patent without substantive examination - the time consuming and costly process during which an application is assessed against relevant statutory criteria.  Substantive examination will only occur if directed by the Commissioner of Patents or requested by the patent owner or a third party.  However, to reduce the scope for unsubstantiated threats the owner of an innovation patent may only take action to exercise their rights if their patent has been substantively examined.  This will give innovation patent owners the option of putting their claims on the public record without the need to go through the costly substantive examination process.</para><para>Although innovation patents will be available for most of the types of invention currently covered by standard patents, they will not be available for plants and animals, or biological processes for the generation of plants and animals.  This exclusion does not include microbiological processes and innovation patents will be available for processes such as cheese and wine making and the synthesis of industrial compounds using microorganisms.</para><para>Over forty-eight other industrialised countries, including Japan and Germany, have already introduced second-tier patent systems.  Overseas experience suggests that the innovation patent should provide better access to intellectual property rights and foster innovation by local enterprises.</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Other amendments to the Patents Act</inline></para><quote><para>This bill will also move many of the fee payment requirements from the Patents Act to the Regulations to enable this administrative function to be handled more efficiently by the Patent Office.  This will enable greater flexibility in handling these administrative functions in the rapidly changing e-commerce environment.</para><para>The final objective of this bill is to introduce a number of minor amendments, some of which are technical in nature.  These amendments remove a number of potential ambiguities and minor inconsistencies in the Act.</para><para>I believe that this bill reflects the Government's commitment to providing Australia with a strong intellectual property system that meets the needs of Australians.  The innovation patent will provide a greater incentive for Australians, particularly individuals and small and medium business enterprises, to invest in innovation and the marketing of their good ideas.  The amendments to the fee payment provisions of the Act will enable the Government to provide a modern fee payment system for users of the patent system.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (UNITED NATIONS AND ASSOCIATED PERSONNEL) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17532</page.no><id.no>R1097</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>17532</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>17532</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17532</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>I am pleased to introduce this bill which will enable Australia to ratify the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.  The object of the Convention is to give greater protection to the men and women who under the auspices of the United Nations put themselves at risk while serving the international community.  Recent events overseas have unfortunately once again demonstrated the significant dangers which can face the men and women associated with UN operations. </para><para>While violent attacks against UN personnel in Australia are unlikely, the bill is clearly a desirable measure.  Domestic laws of this kind underline the determination by a significant part of the international community to deter such attacks and to do everything possible to bring offenders to justice.  The bill assists the attainment of these ends by strengthening the ability of Australian authorities to take action against alleged offenders.</para><para>This bill deals with the individual criminal responsibility of persons who attack UN and associated personnel.  It adds a new division, Division 71, to the Commonwealth Criminal Code which makes the crimes set out in the Convention offences in Australian domestic law.</para><para>Proposed section 71.16 describes the circumstances in which Australia will be able to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the offences established by the bill.  The offences will apply to attacks against UN and associated persons occurring outside Australia where there is an Australian connection, for example if the victim or the alleged offender is an Australian.  Subject to a provision which prevents Division 71 overlapping with State and Territory criminal laws, the bill will also apply to attacks committed in Australia.</para><para>I might point out that, in accordance with provisions of the Convention, the proposed offences will not apply where the UN or associated persons are connected with authorised enforcement operations in which UN personnel are engaged in combat against organised armed forces and to which the law of international armed conflict applies.</para><para>I am pleased to say that the governments of the States and Territories have been consulted about the Convention and that there is general support for Australia becoming a party.  The bill reflects this cooperative approach by expressly preserving State and Territory criminal laws.  In addition, it will not be possible to convict a person in a State or Territory court for an offence under Division 71 if the relevant conduct is the subject of a criminal penalty under a law of that State or Territory.  This means, in effect, that the offences created by this law will not operate in relation to conduct that occurs in Australia where the relevant State and Territory law implements Australia's convention obligations.  The Commonwealth law will operate primarily in relation to conduct outside Australia as well as being available to cover any gap in local criminal laws.  </para><para>I hope that the proposed legislation will receive broad support.  The Convention was signed for Australia under the former Government.  I am pleased that the present Government is able to complete the steps necessary for Australia to become a party to the Convention.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2000 summer sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17533</page.no><id.no>R1122</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>17533</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 6 September.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Jim (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McKiernan)</inline>—Order!

By making that change, the amendment is now absolutely clear. The amendment would make operative the Democrats' recall of parliament within two days if the defence forces were called out in relation to any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. We would remember from yesterday that the Labor Party had some difficulty with the potential of a call-out for terrorists being flagged. This gets around that difficulty, but it also provides for the very important role of parliament to be brought into session as expeditiously as possible to deal with a call-out by the executive of the armed services against Australian civilians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17534</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to compare the amendments that were moved initially by the Democrats, taking into account Senator Brown's amendment to them, with an amendment that will be put forward by the opposition in relation to this same section of the bill. Labor's amendment No. 4 on the running sheet says that, within 24 hours of a declaration being made, notification will be given to the Presiding Officer of each house of parliament for tabling in that house. I support the essence of Labor's amendment, but I foresee a problem in that, if the houses are not sitting, that notice is merely forwarded to the Presiding Officer and there is no action whatsoever to recall the parliament. That is why I prefer the amendment that has been put forward by the Democrats, because it clearly articulates and covers the situation if parliament is not sitting—that is, it must be summonsed within two days of making the order. We know that there are periods when both houses of parliament can rise for up to six weeks, and two or three weeks is not uncommon. So if there is a situation within Australia that is severe enough to require the calling out of the troops to support the state police, then I believe it is equally important that the parliaments are recalled to assess that issue. </para></talk.start><para>There are two reasons to recall parliament. Firstly, it would very quickly provide support for the minister's actions if the order were passed by both houses. So it would shift the responsibility from the ministers or the Governor-General or whoever made the order to parliament. Secondly, it would expose the decision to debate in both chambers. We have to look at this particular amendment in light of the development of this bill. As the bill has progressed and has been amended, the issue we have been continually raising is the rights of the states. So the amendments that have been agreed to by both the government and the opposition have, in essence, removed the rights of the states to object. Therefore, the only other option now available is for the federal parliament to take the role in place and in support of the states. This is particularly relevant to the Senate, because senators are elected to this house on the basis that they are here to represent the states from which they are elected. The reason I find this particular amendment so pivotal in the development of this bill is that I believe it is the last chance in this legislation to put in place a mechanism for the states, through their representatives in this chamber, to assess the decisions of the executive government. I commend the Democrat amendments and also Senator Brown's amendment to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>17534</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is the opposition's intention to circulate a further amendment, which I have just given to the clerks and which deals with the same issue that is addressed by Senator Brown's amendment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name></talker><para>—Is this an amendment to Senator Brown's amendment or to my amendments?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—No, Senator Bourne.

So we are pressing that amendment and we will be moving a further amendment, which I have just finalised and I am circulating to senators in the chamber now. That amendment has been handed to the clerk and other senators, and obviously you will receive that as soon as possible.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition have looked long and hard at the question that is before the chair, the issues raised by Senator Bourne in her substantive amendment, and the proposal that stands in Senator Brown's name. The opposition are concerned about the drafting of the amendment that stands in Senator Brown's name. I do believe that it is a little confused and would not in fact achieve Senator Brown's objective. I appreciate that I missed the first part of Senator Brown's contribution, but I believe he might have also proposed a change to the amendment that currently stands in his name. I will have a close look at that in very short order.</para><para>Given the preconditions that must be satisfied prior to a call-out order lawfully being made—that is, that a state or territory is unable to protect itself against extreme violence—a call-out, as I think the committee is aware, could only occur in the most extreme circumstances of violence. A situation of extreme domestic violence justifying a call-out would be of such moment that it is inconceivable that parliament should not be recalled. The opposition believes categorically that parliament would have an important role in these extraordinary and highly unusual circumstances. There would be an obligation on the parliament to reassure the Australian public that matters justifying the call-out were being appropriately dealt with. You would recall, Mr Temporary Chairman McKiernan, that parliament was recalled for a special sitting of two days when the decision was made to send troops to the Gulf War. The deployment of the defence forces domestically to assist civilian authorities in situations of grave emergency would be at least as significant a matter for the parliament's consideration as sending troops to the Gulf War, if not of greater import. </para><para>As I have said, the wording of the agreed amendment to the Democrat amendments, with respect to parliamentary recall and oversight, is unacceptable and unworkable. The Labor amendment that I have had circulated and will move at the appropriate time would ensure that parliamentary recall is triggered by a very clear event—that is, the declaration of a general security area made by the authorising ministers under division 3. I think Senator Bourne would recall the sorts of comments that I made earlier in the committee stage debate about Labor's concerns with the amendments she has moved. Labor accept the force of a number of the arguments that have been presented to the committee. I think the spirit or the intention of the amendments that Senator Bourne and Senator Brown have moved in relation to the recall of parliament is one that we share, but we, of course, do not want to find ourselves in a position of supporting what we think are flawed amendments and a flawed approach.</para><para>Parliamentary recall should not be required for the exercise of powers under division 2. I have said before—but let me make it clear again for the record—that for operational and strategic reasons we recognise that it would be counterproductive, or it may be counterproductive, to put terrorists on notice that a Defence Force call-out has occurred, and that in some circumstances Defence Force personnel, such as SAS officers, have been mobilised to respond to a terrorist threat. The approach of the opposition, which is contained in the amendment that I have now circulated, would provide the reassurance that is needed in relation to the exercise by Defence Force personnel of the Commonwealth's constitutional powers in this particular area.</para><para>The opposition have tried to respond in a very sensible and purposeful way to an important issue that has arisen during the committee stage debate of this bill. We think our approach is very balanced and strong. In our view, an absolutely essential accountability measure is the prompt recall of the Australian parliament in the appropriate circumstance—namely, a call-out under division 3 of this act. </para><para>In taking this step to move this amendment in response to the arguments that have been mounted in the chamber I want to make this point on behalf of the opposition, and it is a very important one that I think would be accepted around the chamber, but let me make it absolutely clear for this committee and the Senate. The opposition do not contemplate, and would not give the parliament any responsibility for, operational control over the defence forces. I think that would be generally accepted, but I think it is an important point that, as far as the opposition are concerned, I want to see in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record.</para><para>I indicate the opposition's approach here in debate on Senator Bourne's and Senator Brown's amendments, because this means a further opposition amendment will be moved at a later stage. In indicating that the opposition do not favour the approach that is currently advocated by Senator Bourne and Senator Brown, I want to place on record what the opposition's alternative approach is, understanding the spirit of the amendments that have been moved in this committee. As far as the opposition are concerned, we accept that, with a division 3 call-out—or, in other words, let us be clear, a major domestic conflagration but not terrorist threats or terrorist incidents, which is the distinction we are making—when, of course, parliament is not sitting, which I think senators understand, the parliament would be recalled and must sit within a period of six days after the Presiding Officers receive a statement that is forwarded in accordance with paragraph 2F. </para><para>I believe that this is an important amendment. It outlines a new approach that the opposition is taking in relation to this important element of the bill. We believe it means that there will be, in the circumstances of a division 3 call-out, appropriate, proper and immediate parliamentary accountability. I would commend the time frame that I have spoken about. I think it is more sensible in the circumstances. I think it is achievable. I think it is fair to say that the opposition embraces—I think I used these words before—the `spirit' of the amendments that have been moved by Senator Bourne and Senator Brown. I think we have come up here with a formulation that is watertight and is worthy of support by the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17536</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While we are discussing my amendment and an amended version of Senator Brown's amendment to amend mine, I should make a few points about the amendment of the opposition's which has just been distributed.

My amendment does not do that. It gives operational control in essence to the parliament over the executive—and not even the executive, and not even the cabinet: over the Prime Minister, the defence minister and the Attorney-General, if they sign that call-out warrant.</para></talk.start><para>I understand your problems with division 2. I do not think that they are actually the problem you think they are. But I understand that you have a legitimate problem with that. I therefore think that Senator Brown's amendment is a good one and, subject to having another look at it, I am quite happy to accept it to my amendment. I am not happy, however, to accept the opposition's alternative. I do not know what sort of water it is tight from: maybe it is watertight if you are in the executive. But, if you are in the parliament, the whole ocean could get into this.</para><para>It says that each house must sit within six days—that is a long time. It does not say that the houses have to discuss this: they can just sit and do ordinary business. It does not say the houses have to agree. So I do not know why we are even sitting, really. And it is badly drafted, I have to say, because there was a major problem with my own, which I had to have fixed, which was about what happens in the event of prorogation of the parliament. This does not address that at all—which is why mine is so long. If you have a look at the three amendments that I am moving, they are huge; and this is two lines. The reason they are huge is that there are problems with the drafting that had to be fixed, and those problems exist with this. Pathetic as this is, the problems still exist with it: in the event of prorogation of the parliament, there is no provision in here. So we have drafting problems; and I can understand that, because it has been done so quickly. And that is the problem, basically, with the entire bill. We have huge problems because it has been done so quickly.</para><para>This bill is watertight if you are the Prime Minister, the defence minister or the Attorney-General. It is watertight for them, all right; and this will make it even more watertight for them. But, if you are anybody else in the entire country, it is a problem. There are drafting problems with this, because it has been done so quickly. There are drafting problems with the whole bill, because it has been done so quickly. There are huge problems with the whole bill, because it has been done so quickly. I am not getting phone calls for nothing to my office from people in the defence forces and people in the Labor Party—but they were not in the defence forces—saying, `Please do what you can about this.' We had calls yesterday. I keep getting emails about it: `We do not want to be put in this position.'</para><para>There is a reason I am getting those calls: the population of Australia is not coming along with this. The population of Australia likes the constraints that are on the calling out of the defence forces now; they like the fact that they are constrained by the fact that they do not know how far they could go. They like the fact that the constraint is that, if the defence forces take out a weapon and shoot anybody, they are very likely, under the Constitution, to be charged with assault, with murder—very likely to be. That is why it has never happened in the past. They like that constraint. They want that constraint to continue. Everybody agrees that there has to be something that gives the defence forces codification of what they should do in a terrorist attack: division 2. Everybody agrees with that. I think you would get the whole of Australia agreeing with that. But the Labor Party must realise—because, if I am getting calls and emails from members of the Labor Party, so are they—that their own members and, more importantly, the Australian population do not agree that this bill should go through as it is. Any time we do that sort of thing it is a problem. This potentially involves people dying. That is where the big problem is. That is what should have been taken a lot more notice of by both the government and the opposition. </para><para>I appeal to the opposition and to the government not to agree to this amendment of the opposition's—which does virtually nothing—at the expense of my own. Senator Faulkner can say all he likes how good his is in relation to mine. It is not. Look at it: `six days'—we do not have to discuss it and do not have to agree to it. And what happens in the prorogation of parliament? Really, the best thing to do with this is to vote the thing down on the third reading or to put it off for a couple of months—which, goodness knows, we do with enough bills—until we can amend it properly; until the Australian parliament agrees that what is in this bill is the way they want to be protected. You have a bill that potentially allows three members of the executive to call out the defence forces—this is the potential, the worst case; but it allows it—and allows them to shoot Australians dead. That is what it allows.</para><para>This is where the constraint is right now, in that they could be charged. But, once this is through, if it is constitutional, they cannot be charged. If it allows that, the Australian people should be on-side and should agree that is what they want—and they do not. They are not on-side; they do not want it. They want it done properly. It is not being done properly. This is not an adequate substitution for my amendment—absolutely not. I cannot possibly vote for that. I would be interested to see what the government does, but I urge everybody in the chamber to please go and read your emails and ask who is ringing your office and what they are saying about this. Have another look at these amendments; have another look at all the amendments. Think really closely—really closely—after you have done all that, about whether you in fact want to vote for the third reading of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>17537</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bourne is right, and Senator Faulkner is wrong. He says that Labor's amendment is watertight. If that is the case, I hope Labor is never in control of the Navy, or they will all end up on the seabed.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bourne has given an outline of the flaws, as far as the recall of parliament itself is concerned. But I want to talk about how this Labor amendment fails to even have a recall of parliament under a wide range of circumstances, under division 2, where Australian civilians are involved. You do not get a recall of parliament unless there has been a general security area declared; this is an operational procedure. So one of the ways to avoid a recall of parliament is: do not declare the security area; just go ahead with the operation. Under division 2 where you do not have a general security area declared, for example under the heading of `Recapturing premises etc.' it states:</para><quote><para>(1) Subject to this section, a member of the Defence Force—</para></quote><para>that is, a soldier—</para><quote><para>who is being utilised in accordance with section 51D may, under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force:</para><para>(a)	recapture premises, a place, a means of transport or other thing—</para></quote><para>and, in connection with that—</para><quote><para>(i) free any hostage from the subject premises etc.; </para><para>(ii) if the member finds in the subject premises etc. a person whom the member believes on reasonable grounds has committed an offence ... detain the person ...</para></quote><para>It does not go on to say it but, inherent in that, if the person is escaping and they are believed to have committed an offence, they can be shot. It goes on:</para><quote><para>(iii) evacuate persons found in the subject premises etc. to a place of safety;</para><para>(iv) search the subject premises etc. for dangerous things ...</para></quote><para>When you look at the definition, that means anything that could be used as a weapon. It continues:</para><quote><para>(v) seize any dangerous thing ...</para></quote><para>and so on. Let us look at this. Let us get back to real situations that the government and the opposition never discuss. What happens if protesters occupy government buildings? That has happened often enough in the past.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Bourne happily shares office space, I think, with the Prime Minister in Sydney. She has just said that building has been occupied a number of times. So the troops can be sent in to a situation like that and this recall provision does not pertain. There could be a prolonged use of troops in that circumstance which could also affect transport facilities—and we think immediately of the wharves. With a prolonged strike on the wharf, the troops could be sent in to a situation like that to `recapture a means of transport'—that is what it says here. But, under the Labor amendment, there would be no need for a recall of parliament, despite a long and agonising confrontation between troops and Australian citizens, because the amendment misses that. There could be a protest about Pangea. I bring that up again, because the troops can be sent in to recapture premises that effectively have become immobilised or captured by being surrounded by thousands of protesters, and there is no recall of parliament under this provision.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Again, the problem is that there is no division in this legislation; there is no differentiation between terrorists, which Labor and everybody else is worried about, and civilians, which it seems the crossbenches are worried about—and that is the flaw. The amendment that Senator Bourne has brought forward—the one I have modified because Labor had concerns about terrorists—is the right one. It says that there should be a recall of parliament if the troops are sent out in relation to any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. That is the right one. It says, `Recall parliament if civilians are involved in this—if this use of the armed services is to put down a public protest or a strike.' It is Labor that is muddled about this. It is Labor that is confused. It is Labor that has an unsatisfactory and far from watertight amendment. The legislation is tragically flawed. Labor has tried to fiddle around the edges with it. It is trying to do that again. But I ask Labor to look at the flaws in the argument and look at the flaws in its amendment.</para><para>I had drawn up a similar amendment to Labor's as a backstop because I thought this might happen. I thought that Labor could come up with a very weak amendment, an unsatisfactory amendment, as an excuse for not voting for Senator Bourne's amendment, which is the right way to go. But I miscalculated, because Labor has managed to come up with something even weaker. Instead of having parliament recalled within two days of the unthinkable—the troops being brought out against Australian civilians—it has brought that back to six days. So a call-out of the troops to go to the Gulf or to East Timor can get a more rapid recall of parliament than a call-out of troops to be used against Australian civilians, and that is quite unsatisfactory. These are real arguments, these are cogent arguments, these are commonsense arguments. Labor's amendment does not stand up to scrutiny. Labor's amendment does not ensure that parliament is brought into play where the defence forces are brought out against civilians. </para><para>Finally, I want to comment on Senator Faulkner's concern that parliament is not being given operational control. Division 2, section 51I(2), `Ministerial authorisation', which is about the call-out of troops in circumstances where parliament would not be recalled under Labor's amendment, says: </para><quote><para>However, the member—</para></quote><para>that is, the member of the defence forces, a soldier—</para><quote><para>must not recapture the subject premises etc—</para></quote><para>that is, must not go in against protesters who are occupying a building somewhere, a field, or anywhere at all—</para><quote><para>or do any of the things mentioned in paragraphs (1)(b) or (c) in connection with any recapture of the subject premises etc., unless the authorising Ministers, or a Minister (whether or not one of the authorising Ministers)—</para></quote><para>any one of them, in other words—</para><quote><para>authorised in writing by them, has in writing authorised the recapture.</para></quote><para>So we have direct ministerial control, by any one of three ministers, of what the Army is doing, but Labor says, `Let's not have parliament involved.' I believe that where you give ministers authority like that, you very much need parliament to be a watchdog. Otherwise we are setting up a situation for an authoritarian group of ministers—quite contrary to the expectations of those who cherish Australia's democracy—to take massive control of the defence forces against Australian civilians.</para><para>I appeal to the Labor Party, as Senator Bourne has, to see the flaw in the direction they are going and to at least bring back into play this check: that parliament should be used where the armed forces are brought out against Australian civilians. I might add that it is not just a case of bringing parliament back to look at what is going on; it is a case of ensuring that those who would call out the Army know that parliament is about to be brought into play. It is a very important check on the abuse of power by the executive wanting to grab control of the armed forces for a political matter against political dissent, and none of us is so foolish as to believe that cannot happen. This is an extremely important check. </para><para>The amendment that Senator Bourne has brought forward, with the subsequent amendment I have added, is cogent, it clearly delineates the need for parliament to be recalled if the armed services are brought out against civilians, and it should be adopted. If Labor vote against this, they are voting against the authority of parliament, they are voting for the authority of an executive—a minister or two—to use the defence forces in a wide range of circumstances against Australian civilians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>17539</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Both Senator Bourne and Senator Brown have highlighted some of the inadequacies in Labor's amendment that has just been circulated in the chamber, but there is another issue that I wish to canvass. In doing so, I will highlight the differences between Senator Bourne's amendment and the Labor Party's. Senator Bourne's amendment is specifically directed to section 51A, and that is an order about utilising the defence forces to protect Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. It also refers to section 51B, which is an order about utilising defence forces to protect states against domestic violence. So if we are looking for clarity in this bill, and I believe that we need to, Senator Bourne's amendment brings much more clarity to the issue. If we then consider Senator Brown's amendment that parliament would not be recalled unless there were Australian citizens involved, I believe that brings together the best essence of what Senator Bourne is attempting to do, and that is that the house can be recalled if there is any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action.</para></talk.start><para>The other deficiency I see in Labor's amendment, as Senator Brown has clearly set out, is that it only speaks to division 3 of the bill, which relates to the granting of a general security area. Senator Brown highlighted that you can get around the whole of Labor's amendment if you do not declare the general security area. I believe there is another flaw in the amendment that Labor has failed to take into consideration, and I now seek some clarification from the minister. Can the minister indicate where in the bill it states the time that should pass between the issuing of a general security area notice and that notice being presented to the Presiding Officers? I believe that is another missing link. The general security area could be declared, but I do not believe there is anything in the bill that sets out how much time is to expire between that general security area being declared and the Presiding Officers receiving a copy of the notice. If I am incorrect and the minister can direct me to a section of the bill that shows that there is a time requirement for that notification to be given, that will go a long way to allaying some of my fears. </para><para>The second difference between Labor's amendment and Senator Bourne's is the difference between when each house of parliament is required to sit. Senator Bourne's amendment states that the parliament must be recalled in two days, and Labor's amendment allows for parliament not to have to be recalled for up to six days. We are led to believe by the government that these orders will be given only in cases of extreme provocation, civil unrest or industrial action. I do not believe it is acceptable for that to be allowed to continue for six days. Could the minister indicate clearly to us the period of time between a general security area being declared and notification of that coming to the Presiding Officers of the parliament?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>17540</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To answer that question, I would direct Senator Harris's attention to opposition amendment No.4, which talks of forwarding the general security area notice, within 24 hours of the declaration being made, to the Presiding Officer of each house of parliament for tabling in that house. That order is made, within 24 hours it goes to the Presiding Officers and then, in accordance with the opposition amendment that Senator Faulkner has been talking to, parliament must sit within six days of the Presiding Officers receiving that notice. There is a time frame there, Senator Harris, and quite an appropriate one. </para></talk.start><para>The government will be supporting the amendment put forward by the opposition for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a workable proposition. It is to be preferred to the amendments proposed by the Democrats and the Greens. It is workable because it refers only to division 3 powers. The opposition has outlined the difference between division 2 and division 3: division 2 concerns the operational type of situation, where you would be dealing with antiterrorist measures; and division 3 deals with declaring general security areas, where you are more likely to deal with a wider group of people in the community. Senator Faulkner outlined that division 2 sits in a different category. We do not want to see parliament having operational control over security matters which require instant response and, of course, confidentiality. You do not want to flag to the world at large or to international terrorists that, should they want to take any action in Australia, there will be a convoluted process involving parliament. They would see a great opportunity.</para><para>Senator Brown has conceded that point in his proposed amendment. The problem is that the amendment proposed by Senator Brown, coupled with the Democrats', is not as workable as the one proposed by the opposition. I would cite another reason against the time constriction of two days proposed in the amendment by the Democrats. In 1991, parliament was given four days notice when the Gulf War was being considered. I would invite those three senators, Senators Brown, Bourne and Harris, who do not come from Western Australia, to consider those who do come from Western Australia. They have to travel very much further than people from most of the eastern states. Try it—I have been doing it for seven years. Two days is very short notice to give to people who have to come from the other end of the continent to Canberra to sit. The opposition's proposal of six days is much more workable. As the government have said, we are open to constructive suggestions, and the opposition has put forward a constructive proposal for the workability of this.</para><para>The question of parliament being prorogued was raised by Senator Bourne. The advice that I have in relation to that query is that of course the Senate would be available to sit even if the House of Representatives were prorogued. You will note that opposition amendment No. 1 on sheet 1926 says:</para><quote><para>Each House of the Parliament must sit within 6 days after its Presiding Officer receives the statement ...</para></quote><para>We would envisage that you would have both houses available but, if the parliament had been prorogued, the Senate could sit. That is the advice that I have received. You still have that parliamentary involvement, you still have the accountability and you still have that balance of an operational capacity, and for all those reasons the government are persuaded to support the amendment proposed by the opposition. It is a constructive one, one which I think has a balance about it, safeguarding the interests of the Australian people, both in a security sense and in an accountability sense. The drafting is to be much preferred. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>17541</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot believe the last statement by the minister that the drafting is to be much preferred. I suppose it is preferred because it is very short. Senator Ellison made three points that I think I should answer. If the House of Representatives is prorogued, that does not mean that the Senate will not be. If there is a double dissolution, the Senate will be. You have to worry about that. On the 1991 recall, I was here in 1991 and I remember the recall. If you think two days is not adequate—and keep in mind that, out of our nine senators, two are from Western Australia—amend it to three. I will accept an amendment to three.</para></talk.start><para>The point of the recall is that you cannot leave it for a long time, because goodness knows what is being done. It should be left to the absolute minimum time to enable the maximum number of members of parliament to come back here to discuss it and decide whether or not what has been agreed to by three members of the cabinet is agreed to by the majority of the representatives of the Australian people. That, of course, includes the opposition. As I said when I moved this, the point of this whole thing is that the opposition would have to be consulted. Even if we were not, the opposition would have to be. The Labor Party are in opposition now, but they might be in government then and they might not want to consult the opposition. That is fine, but they are in opposition now. What if this happens during the Olympics? I do not think it will, but what if it does? And this is a good one: what if something happens on the waterfront again? What if that sort of thing happens? Do the opposition not want to be consulted? Of course they want to be consulted. I just find this absolutely outrageous.</para><para>The other thing that Senator Ellison said is that the government are open to suggestion. I have made lots of suggestions. Senator Brown has made lots of suggestions. Senator Harris has made lots of suggestions. The favourite suggestion of all three of us is the sunset clause. The government were not open to that suggestion. But, hang on a minute, the government were open to every single suggestion from the opposition. This could be just a matter of those at that end of the chamber getting together and being open to each other's suggestions, because I suggest that the opposition will vote for every one of the government's amendments and the government will probably vote for every one of the opposition's amendments. They are open to suggestion from each other all right, but they are absolutely closed to any suggestion from anywhere else. I do not care what that suggestion is. I could put up a suggestion that all members of the Defence Force should be given rice pudding on Tuesdays and they would not even think about it. They would find some reason to say that it was absolutely ridiculous. I could put up any suggestion at all—I do not care what the suggestion. It might be the best suggestion on the face of this earth and they would not listen.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—If you put up an amendment about rice pudding—</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>—Not only would they not listen, Senator Faulkner is refusing to listen now.

The next time a waterfront situation happens and the troops are called out, I know who is going to be blamed. It is going to be very unpleasant for them. I hope that never happens. I pray that never happens. But this bill takes off constraints. That is exactly what it does. If the Defence Force go out there with guns, it will take off the constraints—if it is constitutional, and we are not even sure of that yet. If that happens and anything goes wrong—and I hope to God that it does not—I do not think it will be the government that will be blamed. I suspect it will be the Labor Party, because people thought better of them. People thought they could get this right. People thought they should have got this right. I think there are a lot of Australians who have given up on the government getting things right. Really, the way this bill has been dealt with is such a disgrace.

With the structure of the bill now, as it has been amended, there is no redress for a state, and that is the important issue we need to look at today. A decision to call out the troops would be made by, at best, three ministers and, at worst, one minister—or there could be a call-out by the Governor-General in total isolation. A situation could arise where a state has no say in that process at all. A situation could also very easily arise where a state is totally in opposition to the order being given. Senator Bourne's amendment is so important because it allows representatives of a state to assess the decision of, at best, three ministers and, at worst, one minister—or, possibly, the Governor-General.

I think I have indicated to the committee before why the opposition amendments relate to division 3 powers. We take the view that to include division 2 powers, which are the specific counterterrorism powers, would mean the terrorists could be forewarned through the publication of the order that the ADF was going to undertake, say, operations to free hostages, or whatever might be planned. Our view is that would put lives at risk. It is for those reasons that we have made this notification apply to division 3 powers.</para><para>But we do believe it is important that the government's actions are brought to the parliament's attention as soon as an order for a call-out is given. We support the government amendments with regard to presenting the order and a report on the call-out to parliament at the end of the call-out, so the government's and the ADF's actions can be scrutinised by the parliament. However, we do believe that parliament should be immediately notified if the government is calling out the troops so that it is in a position to assess for itself whether the action is necessary and, of course, so parliament can respond. As senators would be aware, I will be moving a further amendment about the recall of parliament in certain circumstances. There has been some considerable debate on that issue this morning. This amendment in relation to notification of parliament is, in the view of the opposition, again an important amendment, another opposition sponsored improvement to the bill, and I commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>17543</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the committee that I will support this opposition amendment. I will not vote it down, as Labor and the government have done repeatedly to amendments which I believe would be far more effective in ensuring clarity with this bill. Labor's amendment that has just been moved only speaks to the issue of a general security area. I believe that is the enormous deficiency of this amendment and why we articulated the argument so strongly for the Democrat amendment as amended by Senator Brown.</para></talk.start><para>If we look at section 51A—which Labor's amendment has no correlation with whatsoever—we see it is about the defence forces being able to be called out to protect Commonwealth interests against domestic violence. The whole tenor of this debate all of the way through has been that if this bill delineated between terrorist activities and lawful opposition of Australian citizens we would not be having this extended debate. But it is clearly indicated by the government and by the opposition that they intend to leave the two entwined. So, effectively, the government and Labor have created the situation where the defence forces can be called out in any state against the wishes of that state and there is no assessment or redress in relation to an order issued under section 51A. </para><para>Then we have the even more ridiculous situation where an order is issued under 51B; that is, an order utilising defence forces to protect states against domestic violence. So we are no longer looking at the Commonwealth's responsibility to protect its own property; we are now looking at the situation where the Commonwealth can walk in and say, `We're here because we've decided that we need to protect your property or people.' There is no redress for the state. It can object until the cows come home, but under this bill the Commonwealth will have the facility. Labor is saying, `We're going to recall parliament.' They are not going to recall parliament under 51A, and they are not going to recall parliament under 51B. And, as we have so clearly said before, if a general security area is not declared they do not have to recall parliament then either. So what is the purpose of Labor's amendment? We will leave that for Labor to articulate, because I think they are going to have a very difficult job doing that.</para><para>Yes, I will vote for the amendment, because if—and I stress if—a general security area is declared, yes, the parliament will be brought in. But it is a very sad option. I believe that an option that would have the parliament assess the decision of the ministers in all cases is what this committee should recommend. It is not going to be that way, and it is not because of a lack of argument or a lack of clarity in the argument that we have put forward; it is because the government and Labor are viewing this from the same position. I have had put to me recently: what is the difference between the government and Labor? So, what is the difference between the Liberal Party, the National Party and Labor? Only the spelling.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17544</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In light of the amendment that Labor just voted down, with the government, this amendment is manifestly unsatisfactory. This amendment does allow for the Presiding Officers to be notified and, with a further amendment, we will be seeing provision for the recall of parliament within six days, given some of the potential uses for the military under the executive. But Senator Faulkner says, `Labor's improving this bill as it goes along.' Labor are passively negotiating with the Liberals to see what changes they can make and accepting that as the boundary. They are ignoring the very serious democratic considerations which are at the heart of this legislation now, and the right of the elected parliament to be the authority which has the say over any call-out of the armed services, by the executive, for use against civilians. This Labor amendment does not do that. There are a whole range of call-out provisions that would enable the executive to send the troops in against protesters and strikers in Australia that will not see a notification occur or parliament recalled.</para></talk.start><para>Labor should have got this right. Labor knows what the difference is, but Labor is dissembling on its obligation and duty to uphold democracy. There is a drift to authoritarianism written into this legislation and these weak comeback provisions that Labor is engendering here, with the permission, always, of the government. The generating force there is not the Labor Party; it let this through the House of Representatives as is. It was not going to make even these paltry amendments. But it has come under fire from the Greens, from the Democrats and from One Nation, and it has come under fire from its own constituency. The phones are running hot. We have Labor supporters and members ringing our office saying, `We've just resigned' or, `We're going to resign. We do not want to be part of this party that sells out on democracy like this; that opens the door for the executive—not just the executive of a Labor government in the future, but the executive of a conservative government or a government of any ilk—to send in the troops against Australian civilians.' And Labor says that an amendment like this means it is improving the legislation! But that is spin, and it does not wash. Labor has the hand of the government visibly upon it. I asked Senator Faulkner earlier in this debate if he would acquaint the committee with who has lobbied Labor on the matter. Has the US embassy? Has any other foreign embassy? Have the armed services and, if so, which?

I know a number of senators have already expressed views on it, and I have certainly indicated to the committee that I believe this amendment sponsored by the opposition is a very important improvement to the bill. I would commend the amendment to the committee. </para><para>This amendment will mean that there is a new requirement for parliamentary recall—that is, an additional requirement in the bill—which will lift the bar when a call-out is contemplated. That is why the opposition has taken this initiative, and it is why I think the committee should embrace the amend-ment. If this amendment passes, the execu-tive government of the day will be making a call-out order in the full knowledge that parliament will be recalled promptly to consider the circumstances—which must be extraordinary circumstances—that have given rise to the call-out. The amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Labor Party will ensure that each house of the parliament is recalled within six days of the tabling in each house of parliament of the declaration of a general security area. </para><para>Under the amendment that we have just carried, this must be done within 24 hours of a dec-laration being made. If this amendment is carried, it will ensure, in effect, that parliament will sit within seven days of such a declaration being made. If the parliament is sitting at the time a call-out order is made, par-liament would be free to consider and debate the call-out immediately. Labor's amendment means that, if the parliament is not sitting when a call-out order is made, parliament would be free to consider and debate the call-out immediately. That is obviously very important. </para><para>There is going to be a bit of an argument about whether it is two or three days, and this amendment says six days. The point is that this is very prompt. It is contemporaneous with any call-out. I am happy to use the word `immediate', and I think that is a very reasonable approach in these sorts of circumstances. I do not want to spend a great deal of time arguing the case about what travel plans various senators may or may not have. This particular amendment specifies that the parliament must sit within six days of the Presiding Officer receiving a statement that is forwarded in accordance with paragraph 2(f). A senator can make the case that, effectively, that might mean seven days after a call-out. That is true, but that is prompt, that is contemporaneous and, in effect, that is immediate. As a call-out order lasts for up to 20 days unless it is extended, parliamentary debate will occur either during the currency of an order or, in the case of a short order which ceases to have effect within seven days, immediately thereafter. This does allow the parliament to scrutinise the actions of the government of the day while the issue is current. It does enable parliamentary accountability. Parliamentary recall is in addition to the notification procedures already in place, which include the publicising of the order, the gazetting of the order and the tabling of the order in the parliament, as I have indicated. </para><para>We would say, quite simply, that it is inconceivable that parliament should not be recalled in the highly unusual circumstances of extreme domestic violence justifying a call-out. I do not want to canvass the ground again in relation to the point that I think was made that this is for powers under the declaration of a general security area made by the authorising ministers under division 3. We have indicated our approach to division 2 powers and we have, I think, mounted a very strong and unarguable case that for operational and strategic reasons it is not appropriate to put this mechanism for the exercise of powers in place under division 2. I think there is a grudging acceptance by all in the committee that that is the case. Perhaps some do not even grudgingly accept that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>— No, you're wrong as far as I'm concerned.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—All right.

We are left with these paltry bits and pieces with which to try to amend the bill, which, at the end of the day, I will oppose simply because Labor did not fix it up. Labor will not fix it up; it will go over and vote with the government—that is what is going to happen later today at the end of this harrowing debate. This is not about some trite matter. This ought not be about political point scoring. It is about the failure of politics on one of the most important pieces of legislation that you could imagine being brought before this place. This deals with the heart of our democracy. This deals with the time-honoured situation in Australia whereby the police keep domestic peace in the states and territories and the Army keeps us protected from external threat. This bill mixes that all up. There is no clear dividing line after this legislation, and Labor is part of the problem in that.</para><para>Senator Faulkner said that it is inconceivable that parliament should not be recalled after a troop call-out. Well, it is not inconceivable because Labor has allowed for that to happen. It allows that to happen when the troops are called out but there is no declaration of a general security area. As I said earlier—I am not going to go through it again—that can involve a multitude of situations, such as when civilians are protesting against something the government is doing or when something has gone wrong within the country. That is what is wrong with this legislation. That is why the opposition benches are almost as bereft as the government benches because there is not much heart in this legislation. There is not much support amongst the rank and file of the party for this legislation, and there is certainly a lot of antipathy amongst supporters once you get outside this place.</para><para>This amendment says there will be a recall after six days if there has been a declaration of a general security area which extends the powers of troops once they are sent in to fix up some domestic problem here in Australia. That will cover some situations. It totally fails to cover a whole range of other situations, whether that be people occupying the Lodge, a truck drivers blockade of the Hume Highway, a re-run of the Franklin River blockade, a protest against uranium mining in the desert, indigenous people protesting for their lands or a strike on the waterfront. Under those circumstances, if the ministers do not want to do so, there is no need to declare a general security area. The troops are called out but parliament is not—thanks to Labor. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>17548</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Labor's second amendment that they have just moved is again directed only to section 51K(2) of the bill.

Labor's amendment allows for a further six days to pass before the matter must come before the parliament. That is where it stops—full stop. A notification could be brought into this chamber and that would be the total effect. We could have a situation where a state government could be objecting profusely to the order, but there would be no debate in this house because Labor's amendment does not require it.

I believe the government would have received an amount of correspondence, as would have the opposition. The concerns that have been raised have been escalating throughout the debate on this bill. In our correspondence we are now receiving an indication from Defence Force personnel that they will consider terminating their deployment with the Australian Defence Force. I believe the government has not addressed one of the major issues in relation to this bill, that is, the psychology behind having to stand up and shoot your fellow Australian. I indicate to the committee that I will be moving an amendment in the latter part of this debate that will actually be a cry from the wilderness, so that the government and Labor stop and think about what they are doing to Australian Defence Force personnel.</para><para>It is all right for a minister to sign an order and say, `Go out, troops, and do your job!' To a large degree, with all acts of war—and I am now not speaking about the bill—if we had the situation where a couple of generals wanted to go out to war and were put in a football field and given a couple of machine guns, it would be decided really quickly. That is the mentality of the government and the opposition. They are unleashing something that they have not considered the psychological effects of on the people whom they are ordering to carry out the directives. We have only to look at the Vietnam veterans who have come back with horrendous psychological problems as a result of that war. If the government does call out the troops in Australia, that war will have been a walk in the park in comparison with what the psychological effects will be on the people that they are going to call out. Yes, I will support the amendment; but I only support it because it is, in one section of the bill, going to give this chamber the ability to assess the decisions that are made by the executive government.

The question we have here is really one of consistency, and I dare say those senators who have opposed this previously would no doubt oppose the thrust of this. However, this particular amendment is technical in nature and makes the wording consistent throughout all of those sections. But I appreciate that there are senators who would in any event oppose the general thrust of the substance.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>17549</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 12 (lines 1 to 4), omit “unless the Minister, after consulting the Chief of the Defence Force, is satisfied that sufficient numbers of the Permanent Forces are not available”.</para></quote><para>The essence of the amendment is to strike from the bill the ability to use the emergency forces or the reserve forces. The bill itself, in section 51G subsection (b), requires the Chief of the Defence Force to consult with the minister, to be satisfied that there are insufficient numbers in the permanent forces.</para><para>I believe that the government is not taking into consideration what I briefly indicated a few moments ago. I have refrained, in the debate on this bill so far, from putting up scenarios but I am actually going to put one up now. This is a reality. We have two workers in North Queensland working in an engineering firm. One of them is the union rep in that firm and the other one is a member of the North Queensland reserves, in 51st Battalion stationed in Cairns. If the situation that the Australian defence forces are called out for is sufficiently widespread and the permanent forces are insufficient to actually cope with that situation, what we can effectively find is these two guys, who work side by side on machines in their engineering firm, standing on opposite sides in the dispute. One of them, as I said, is the union rep at the engineering firm, and the other is a member of the reserve forces surveillance unit. What a predicament to be put into! I do not believe that any government should have the ability to effectively take the two citizens in this scenario and put them in such a situation where one has to contemplate killing the other.</para><para>That also raises an issue that I raised earlier: where is the training? How does the minister intend to train his reserve forces in the skills that they are going to need: the ability to arrest a person, or the ability to preserve a site where there is evidence? How is he going to train them to apprehend somebody, when all of their military training has been purposely for the neutralisation of an enemy? Yes, they are a surveillance unit; that is what they are trained for. They are not trained to be a crowd control unit; they are not trained to go into areas where there are industrial disputes—and they can be called out, under the bill, under the two sections that we were speaking of earlier, 51A and 51B.</para><para>So this amendment proposes to delete from the bill the ability of the executive or the Governor-General to use reserve forces or—let us put it in its real context—to use civilians to shoot at civilians; that is what it is proposed they do. We may unkindly in North Queensland, in a jovial manner, refer to them as the `cut-lunch cowboys'. But they are an effective unit, they are a dedicated unit—and they are a unit that most certainly should not be used for the purpose that the government intends to bring in with this legislation: being pitted against their fellow citizens, possibly even in their own area. Or are the government going to do what the Chinese did in Tiananmen Square when they found that they could not get their armed forces to remove student dissidents because they could not speak the same dialect? Are they going to then move somebody from a distant part of Australia to North Queensland so that they will be remote from any emotional association with the people they are supposed to be detaining or, in the worst case, shooting?</para><para>The government itself, I believe, needs to look very, very seriously at this issue. It also needs to take on board some of the comments that we are receiving now. As I have indicated before, people are saying, `I believe that I will be leaving the forces if this bill is passed.' I would commend to the government and to the opposition that they stop and think of the psychological pressures that they will put on these reserves. The psychological problems that the Vietnam veterans have found themselves suffering from will pale—I repeat, pale—into insignificance when compared with the psychological problems that will eventuate from these pressures. If any person in this chamber can stand up and deny that soldiers who serve their country do not have emotional problems, then I think this debate has got to a very low ebb. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>17550</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly, Senator Harris put a proposal or a query in relation to the reserves. This proposed legislation states that the reserves would only be used where the numbers of permanent personnel, those members of the regular services, were insufficient to meet the demand. The government would envisage the reserves only being used under division 3 powers. The government would not envisage them being used in the first instance, because we believe that our regular services could do the job But, if an unforeseen circumstance arose, only in exceptional circumstances would the reserves then be used—and only then, we would say, in division 3 matters, and that is in things like the general security area.</para></talk.start><para>But, through the chair, I would say to Senator Harris that the reserves are currently training with the New South Wales police force in exercises involving cordons, searches and checkpoints, so they are undergoing training at the moment. I think that the reserves in this country have quite a high standard. Let us just take the medical area, for example. I know doctors who are in the reserves, and you would not say that they are any less qualified than doctors in the regular services. I know of people who are engineers, people with IT qualifications and people with a range of qualifications which are essential to the reserves; they have very high qualifications in civvy street, if you like, and they translate those to the reserves. That is where we get the benefit of a good reserve force, such as the one we have in Australia.</para><para>So I think to just dismiss it and say that the reserves have not got the training is perhaps inappropriate, because you need to look a bit further than that. But, notwithstanding that, the government clearly has the intention that permanent forces would be used, and only in exceptional circumstances where numbers were not sufficient would reserves be used. I would say that you are only looking at division 3 powers, as opposed to division 2 powers. Division 2 is more for antiterrorists, which would require specialist forces. Obviously, if you had a terrorist situation, you would look to the SAS or a unit of that capability. It would be ludicrous to suggest that you would send in reserves in an instance where they were not qualified, because you have a body of people who are well qualified in the permanent forces that you would use in the first instance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>17550</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the amendment; I support it because of the potential for bringing out the reserves against Australian citizens. I do not want to ever, ever see that happen. If there is a requirement, in the event of an invasion, for the Army to bring out the reserves to help ward that off, that is provided for. We are not talking about that. We are talking about a civil situation here, and I support the amendment that says the reserves should not be used in that situation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17550</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister, in replying to me, gave an assurance that the reserves would be used only under division 3. But when you look at the structure of section 51G, `Restriction on certain utilisation of Defence Force', it says, `In utilising the Defence Force in accordance with section 51D, the Chief of the Defence Force must not ...' and then it goes into paragraph (a). That has now been amended by Labor's amendment. But it goes on, and there is nothing in the section, that I can see, that limits the Chief of the Defence Force to restricting the reserve forces to a division 3 operation. So I ask the minister whether he is willing—and I realise this is on the run—to move an amendment that would put that in the body of the bill. I would also like to very clearly state that in no way do I cast aspersions on the dedication, the qualifications or the ability of the reserve forces or the Australian Defence Force—not in any way—and I totally reject any insinuation that I was casting aspersions on them. What I am trying to raise in this debate is the psychological effects that this bill is going to bring for the people who are going to be required to carry out the actions. So I ask the minister if he would amend section 51G(b) to add the words `providing the reserve forces are used only in connection with division 3 of the bill'. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>17551</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The trouble is that you would have a possible situation where division 3 and division 2 are linked, and it may be that a division 3 situation would be an adjunct to a division 2 situation. Let me give you an example. There might be a siege at an airport where you have specialist forces dealing with terrorism, but there has to be a huge general security area around the airport. We could go into detail—and you would all want to argue about the detail of this example; that is why I hate using them—but the fact remains that you may well need that flexibility in exceptional circumstances where you do need reserves to be there. They might not be the ones going into the hot spot to retrieve hostages, but they may well have a supporting role, and the government believes your amendment would take away the flexibility which might be needed in exceptional circumstances.

This amendment will again write into this legislation the philosophy that the defence forces should not be used against civilians. In this case, he is explicitly saying that the reserve forces—the emergency forces—should not be used against strikers or against people who are protesting in Australia. The permanent forces are available to be, and will be, used at some future time against Australian civilians due to this legislation which Labor and the Liberals are putting through. At least we should have the decency here to say to any future executive that wants to use the reserve forces in this situation: `No, you can't.' It is inconceivable that the executive, having called out the defence forces of Australia against civilians, would then want to call out the reserves as well. You would be in a situation of civil war if that were the case. This legislation is not about that. This legislation is meant to contain terrorist activities, and it has been jumbled up by the two big parties so that it can also be used against civilian protesters. This is a very reasonable amendment. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>17552</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be agreeing with the amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>17552</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the committee for its indulgence in facilitating the circulation of that amendment on the run.

It also brings the call-out powers, where the troops become active in forcefully doing something, in line with the powers that state police have. It effectively requires a warrant to be able to take over a building, to search it and to detain any people inside. It is a very reasonable precaution. It goes towards redressing the gap in powers that this legislation gives to the military as compared with the police. The existing legislation says that, when you have a call-out of the troops in Australia, a magistrate has to go with them. That was written in 1903, but it ensures that the judiciary are there. We are keeping that stipulation in the legislation, but we are updating it. Without this amendment, the bill gives certain ministers of the executive the power to authorise the troops to open fire and to use whatever force is necessary to capture whatever it is they are concerned about. We believe that, under those circumstances, it is protection for the Defence Force personnel—as much as for the citizenry itself—to stipulate that there be a written warrant from a judge of the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of the state or territory that is involved. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>17554</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the Greens amendment which will in effect require consent of the judiciary. Again we are attempting to raise the issues that we see the passage of this bill will bring into effect. The government and the opposition keep on stressing that there are no rules or regulations in place at the moment—far be it from the case. I would like to raise an issue that has been very clearly articulated by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Their recommendation in relation to this bill is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>All searches and seizures should lawful unless made pursuant either to a court order or warrant or, if made without a warrant, in response to circumstances of such seriousness and urgency as to require and justify immediate action without the authority of such an order or warrant, or pursuant to specially designated statutory authorities.</para></quote><para>They go on to say:</para><quote><para>Clearly the general position is that search warrants require concrete information. Moreover, in issuing a search warrant a judge must balance at arms-length the competing interest in the light of this situation. He or she must stand between the police and the citizen and give real attention to the question of whether the information proffered by the police does justify the intrusion they desire to make into the privacy of the citizen.</para></quote><para>There are several issues there that we need to consider in the committee stage of this bill. The first issue I believe they have raised concerns that notion of `at arms-length'. If we have a situation where an order is made and the troops are called out, as we all know there would be escalating emotions involved in that call-out. First of all, you would have to have a substantially provocative situation where the people involved were highly emotional or motivated. Then you would bring out the troops. In that instance it would be very difficult for the troops, even though well-trained, not to be emotionally aroused in relation to the call-out order. So you have two groups of people whose emotions and excitement are escalating in relation to what is happening. In other words, the blood would be fairly pumping.</para><para>I believe it would be prudent to have at that time somebody who is set aside—somebody who is out of the emotional turmoil that necessitated the call-out of the troops. I believe our judiciary perform that function extremely well. They are not required to base their judgment on the emotion in the heat of the disturbance; they are at arms-length to make a decision based on the information that has been put before them by either the police officer or the Australian Defence Force member who applies for—should apply for—the warrant. I believe there are processes for the judiciary to be called out to provide these warrants. It would not introduce undue delay into the process. What it would do, I believe, is to introduce somebody who is at arms-length from the emotion and the escalation to make a realistic and balanced assessment of the situation. I commend the Greens amendment to the committee.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>17554</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Routine of Business</title><page.no>17554</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><motion><para>That—</para><para>(1) consideration of general business and consideration of committee reports, government responses and Auditor-General's reports be postponed till a later hour;</para><para>(2) government business be called on no later than 3.45 pm today; and</para><para>(3) if the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000 is read a third time before 8 pm today, then the routine of business from the completion of the third reading to the adjournment being proposed at 8 pm shall be the routine of business for that period of time as set out in standing order 57. </para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17555</page.no><id.no>R1122</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>17555</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>17555</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Democrats amendment No. 1 on sheet 1927:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 13 (line 23), after “area” insert “(other than the parliamentary precincts within the meaning of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988</inline>)”.</para></quote><para>In moving this amendment I am wondering if it might not be best called the `George Speight amendment'.

Let no-one be in doubt that this bill, with the inclusion and arbitrary nature of the declared security zone, can and does include this parliament. Considering the terrible events that have just recently transpired in Fiji and in East Timor, do the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition really want to enact what is effectively George Speight style legislation? If the events in Fiji have taught us a lesson in democracy, it is that democracy is a fragile thing. It may surprise many in the committee to know that half of the world's inhabitants do not live under democratic regimes.</para><para>It occurred to me that in moving this amendment it might be suggested that if parliamentarians themselves were perhaps in a situation of threat or danger within Parliament House the troops would not be able to be sent in to some form of rescue. That, of course, would not be the case. There are more than adequate existing laws dealing with terrorism that could very effectively accommodate that scenario. That is all I wish to say on that.

Dealing with parliamentary precincts does form part of the national antiterrorist plan, and that is something which has been developed in consultation with state governments. We would say that this really could have the consequences which Senator Greig does not really want—that is, that people could attack Parliament House and the government would not have recourse to this legislation, if it were needed, and only if it were needed.

The first category might be described as a number of minor amendments to the act introduced on 23 June this year. The second category is the introduction of a legislative framework for the electronic clearance of imported goods. The bill also proposes amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. This amendment would align the voting arrangements at the AGM of the corporation for payers of the wine export charge with those arrangements for payers of the wine grape levy. The proposed amendment that relates to the electronic clearances is in response to a recommendation from the Nairn quarantine review, which was an initiative of the former Labor government. It was in fact recommendation No. 63 in that report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australian quarantine: a shared responsibility</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Quarantine is a very difficult issue for any government to deal with. One difficulty that this government has faced is the issue of consistency. The government needs its various policies to deal with industries on a consistent basis, so it needs to deal with the quarantine issue as it deals with the trade issue. I do not think there is any doubt about that in terms of the government's agencies determining the appropriate level of protection available to us under the WTO conventions and international quarantine agreements which we are a party to in relation to sanitary and phytosanitary agreements. As I said, trade impinges on our quarantine policy in that regard, and that raises the issue of a consistent approach by members of the government on that issue. </para><para>It is unacceptable, for example, for members of the government to be aggressive supporters of protection for the Australian car industry while at the same time saying to the pork industry in Australia, `It's in the interests of the nation that your industry be exposed to cheap subsidised exports.' It is for that reason that I was somewhat alarmed by an interview given by Senator Chapman on the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">The World Today</inline> on 10 August. Senator Chapman was being interviewed about the importation of cheap, second-hand cars from Japan. He was asked:</para><quote><para>So you're saying in a sense it's a distorted market and therefore an unfair advantage bringing those cars in.</para></quote><para>Senator Chapman said:</para><quote><para>Absolutely, because on the Japanese market, those cars are virtually worthless and so they can be bought very cheaply by people who want to import them into Australia.</para></quote><para>He was then asked by Philip Williams:</para><quote><para>From the consumers' point of view though, why shouldn't we get the benefit of that? Why shouldn't we get the cheapest possible cars?</para></quote><para>Senator Chapman said:</para><quote><para>Well there are two points there. The first point is these cars don't meet the design standards and in particular the safety standards required of vehicles in Australia. And secondly, we have an industry policy that's established. It's been accepted in the Australian community to maintain motor vehicle manufacturing in Australia, and this rapid escalation in numbers seriously undermines that policy.</para></quote><para>Mr Williams then asked him:</para><quote><para>We're only looking at less than one per cent, I think half a percent of the entire car market made up of these sort of imports.</para></quote><para>Senator Chapman said:</para><quote><para>Well over the last six years, the number of imports increased from about 7,000 a year to about 30,000 a year. So if that rate of increase continues and it has been exponential over that period, if that rate of increase continues, then it is going to be a serious threat.</para></quote><para>Senator Chapman argues that, because of the cost of the imported cars in that case, the domestic market will be distorted with imports and will be unfairly advantaged. Exactly the same could have been said for the South Australian pork industry in 1998. But my staff's search of the database has failed to find a word from Senator Chapman on that matter. According to the parliamentary database, Senator Chapman chose not to run the same argument in support of an industry that I believe is an important job generator in regional South Australia. He argued that it was accepted in the Australian community that we maintain a motor vehicle manufacturing industry. With a large number of people living in regional Australia, we on this side of the chamber believe that Australia needs a viable pork industry. But the database does not show that Senator Chapman was a keen supporter of that argument; he certainly did not put it on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> if he was. </para><para>In response to the suggestion that a number of imported cars would amount to only half a per cent of the entire car market, Senator Chapman said that it was the rate of increase that was of concern, not the absolute number. He said that if the rate of increase continues, then it would become a serious threat to the domestic manufacturing industry. That is exactly the same situation the South Australian pork producers faced. We support the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry. It is a key industry in South Australia. We are also strong supporters of the Australian pork industry. It is a key employer and an income generator throughout regional Australia, and it has faced a number of arguments, some of which have related to issues of quarantine, and I have raised some of those in this chamber.</para><para>If Senator Chapman and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber had accepted their responsibility—if Senator Chapman had accepted his responsibility, in particular, to represent the pork producers in South Australia and other intensive rural industries, as he has been on the record in support of the car manufacturers—that industry would have received better assistance from the government and it would have been received in a more timely manner. After all, it was the government who provided support in what I would describe as dribs and drabs, and reluctantly it was dragged kicking and screaming to its gradual enhancement of support programs for that industry. I suppose one might say that, if it weren't for that, Senator Chapman would not have the argument on his hands in relation to the preselection battle that he is now facing. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>17559</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="R1125">Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> brings up to speed the government's support for the development and increased use of electronic information systems by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which will speed up the clearance of cargo.

The bill is designed to amend the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill 2000 to (1) broaden existing arrangements which require ships to maintain insurance cover in respect of marine oil pollution damage; (2) clarify the liability limit of shipowners in relation to clean-up costs; and (3) clarify the ability of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, to recover costs associated with combating oil pollution threats. This is an important bill designed to protect our seas and our coastal environment from pollution. It is important because the biggest threat to our coastline is pollution, particularly oil pollution. Not only that, but the potential costs to clean up from oil pollution are also extremely high.</para></talk.start><para>The bill amends the protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 to increase protection of the sea from pollution by imposing further regulatory constraints on recalcitrant ship operators. It will broaden existing arrangements that require ships to maintain insurance cover in respect of clean-up costs for marine oil pollution. The bill will also make clearer the liability limit of shipowners with regard to clean-up costs and clarify AMSA's role to recover costs associated with oil pollution. It implements the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. That convention provides that the owner of an oil tanker is strictly liable for pollution damage in a territory or exclusive economic zone of a party to the convention. It also provides that the owner must maintain insurance to specified limits to cover pollution damage. Labor supports this bill because it partially addresses these deficiencies by requiring insurance to be held by all ships of 400 or more gross tonnes—whether or not registered in a convention country—which carry oil as cargo or bunker and are leaving or entering an Australian port.</para><para>Implementation of this bill, such as the checking of documentation to demonstrate insurance is held, will be the responsibility of the Australian Customs Service and AMSA surveyors. Ambiguity has existed about AMSA's power to recover costs incurred where there has been a threat of but not an actual discharge or disposal from a ship and AMSA has taken action to combat this threat. An example is where the ship has gone aground. This bill removes the ambiguity by enabling AMSA to recover costs in these circumstances. </para><para>This bill is important when one considers that AMSA receives about 300 oil spill sighting reports each year. Of these, 22 incidents each year are considered serious enough to warrant some type of response. To date, all ships involved in major spills in Australian waters have had insurance coverage and the costs of the oil spill response have been reimbursed to AMSA and state or territory response agencies. There are, however, no guarantees that all ships visiting Australian waters will have the necessary insurance coverage. A recent incident in New Zealand involving an uninsured ship has reinforced these concerns. </para><para>This bill is consistent with the landmark 1992 House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline> report that uncovered a litany of rorts, environmental disasters and criminal practices plaguing the international shipping industry. That report revealed massive problems with ships that were docking in Australian ports.

The <inline font-style="italic">Digest</inline> uses these words:</para></talk.start><quote><para>On its face, the Bill is a timely response to concerns regarding marine pollution. The various conventions developed by the International Maritime Organisation provide a clear framework for prevention and indemnification in relation to major pollution threats. However, the indemnification regime is limited in its application. It only extends to vessels carrying 2000 tonnes of oil as cargo registered in a Contracting State. It does not extend to empty oil tankers or other vessels carrying less than 2000 tonnes of cargo oil. Nor does it apply in relation to bunker oil or to vessels registered in countries that are not State parties to the Civil Liability Convention. </para><para>The Bill addresses these issues by focusing on the presence of ships within the `internal waters'. It captures all vessels over 400 tonnes gross, wherever they are registered.</para><para>The Bill is intended to implement the terms of the Draft Bunker Oil Convention. However, that convention is not expected to be finalised before March 2001 and may not come into operation until 2002. As indicated above, there may be scope to legislate in respect of draft conventions. But, if there is doubt, some novel arguments may be required for the Bill. </para><para>First, the Bill may be viewed as an exercise of the trade and commerce power, in anticipation of being supported by international law. Second, it may be seen as an exercise of the external affairs power, either in terms of its offshore application or by virtue of its connection with international conventions. One argument is that the existence of the Draft Bunker Oil Convention demonstrates that insurance cover in respect of bunker oil damage is an `issue of international concern'.

Whilst this bill obviously takes a step towards the measures which are necessary, given the fact that we have had some terrible accidents around the world, particularly involving vessels carrying large amounts of fuel oil—and we have had some incidents in Australian waters but, thankfully, no incidents which have been extreme calamities such as the <inline font-style="italic">Exxon Valdez</inline> occurrence, for example—the regime that applies to vessels entering Australian waters needs to be looked at very carefully. </para><para>There are a number of issues the opposition have with this government's policy which, effectively, is attracting not just tankers but a whole range of foreign vessels to the Australian coast. It has created an environment where Australian owned shipping will become a museum piece, in the sense that there is no incentive for businesses to maintain their shipping fleets. We have an ageing Australian fleet. If the current policy parameters continue, it is certain that we will have almost no Australian owned fleet operating for export and import purposes or, indeed, ultimately for coastal trade purposes. That is another issue that I will take up at another time. Whilst the opposition are supporting this bill, we will be looking very closely at the matters that have been raised—when we have an opportunity to do so, if indeed the government does not take the opportunity to do just that—and at fixing what appear to be some potential problems with this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>17561</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the opposition for their support for this bill.

The bill proposes the following amendments to part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974. One, exemptions limited to liner shipping activities covering loading and operations at cargo terminals are clarified to include inland terminals used for assembling export cargo for delivery to a port or delivering cargo to importers. Two, the existing practice of allowing shipping conferences to negotiate collectively with stevedores will be confirmed. Three, the provision prohibiting discrimination between shippers is repealed on recommendation from the Productivity Commission on the basis that it is their view that it could be harmful if it discourages efficient price discrimination. Four, a national interest test is included in the assessment of conduct by parties to an outwards liner shipping agreement that might unreasonably hinder Australian flag shipping. </para></talk.start><para>Five, the minister and the ACCC will be empowered to accept court enforceable undertakings from shipping lines, aimed at ensuring a net public benefit. Six, the protection afforded to exporters under part X is to be extended to importers. Seven, the minister and the ACCC are given increased powers to deal with conduct likely to result in an unreasonable increase in freight rates and/or an unreasonable decrease in services. Eight, conferences will not be permitted to unreasonably restrict entry of new parties. Finally, the objects of part X are amended to cover the inclusion in the part of inwards liner cargo shipping services and Australian flag shipping. </para><para>Labor has also been advised of additional government amendments to the bill to remove any ambiguity about the requirement that liner shipping companies must have a conference agreement registered under part X before the part X exemptions relating to agreements on freight rates come into effect. The Australian Government Solicitor has advised of the possibility for ambiguity in this area, in sections 10.17A and 10.18A. I foreshadow also that Labor does not oppose those additional amendments.</para><para>The NFF and the ACCC had, in fact, called for the removal of part X and Treasury had argued that the exemptions represented an unnecessary anomaly in Australia's competition policy. However, the Productivity Commission agreed with the submissions of shipping companies, the peak Cargo Owners Association and the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The latter groups argued that the part X exemptions benefited exporters by ensuring that regular shipping services were available from Australia. </para><para>To a very limited extent, this bill assists Australian shipping. The objects of part X have always had that principle enshrined. This is welcomed by the opposition and Labor supports the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>17562</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wanted to speak briefly about this amendment and, as Senator Mackay has just indicated, the opposition will be supporting this legislation as it goes a very small step towards measures which are essential to assist the users of shipping and stevedoring industries within Australia.</para></talk.start><para>I remind the Senate that this government has presided over a very distressful and disruptive dispute on the waterfront which culminated in an arrangement whereby $178 million was spent, following a period of great disruption, to shed labour from the stevedoring industry. That money, together with certain other funds, is being recovered by a levy on container traffic and that levy is expected to continue for around nine years. I guess that is subject to how interest rates go and I guess they must be locked in by now, hopefully, for a shorter period than that.</para><para>What has to be said, of course, is that what this government has presided over is not a reduction in shipping costs, not an improvement in turnaround times and not, indeed, a great improvement in container handling rates—all of the benchmarks that this government, through Minister Reith, set down as the tests of its achievement in waterfront reform. We have seen that shipping rates have gone up, meaning, therefore, that the cost to users of Australian ports—to importers and exporters, to our rural industries, and to our manufacturing industries—has been increased. This government has presided over what it described as a reform process, which, as I said, was at great cost to the industry in terms of the disruption that it caused. It certainly did not draw the community together. Ultimately, redundancies were achieved and a package involving $178 million in redundancy payments was put through this parliament. So, we are talking about an amendment to the Trade Practices Act which the opposition is prepared to support. </para><para>It is a pity that, on matters of real reform, this government was not at an earlier stage interested in seeking to obtain a bipartisan approach to reform of the waterfront. I remind the Senate that, for example, the parties to the stevedoring industry dispute, the Maritime Union and Patricks, had been in discussions prior to that great dispute. Indeed, the evidence given to a Senate committee about the reason they could not go any further was that they did not have any money for redundancies available to them. Funnily, those moneys all became available after the great dispute and with the fanfare that these reforms—achieved with confrontation—were going to achieve the seven benchmarks that Minister Reith laid down. What a failure. What a total failure.</para><para>Is it any wonder then that Minister Reith is seen as falling a long way short in his aspiration to one day lead the coalition, which I expect will be to aspire to lead them in opposition because that is where they will be after the next election? Is it also any wonder that he has lost credibility with the Australian public? I think the opposition is very pleased to hear the stories about Minister Reith being set to take a new portfolio.

When we came into government, we had spent 13 years in opposition with a plan to reform the waterfront. And we implemented it. For Senator O'Brien to get up and say that the seven benchmarks have not been met is either self-delusion or misrepresentation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Just visit the Melbourne waterfront, for example.

On a good day previously, I can tell Senator Sherry, they would have been lucky to have lifted 22. The average in Melbourne was down towards 16 or 18. That is where the fight was centred, that is where the fight has been won and that is where the improvements are so obvious.</para><para>I know the Sydney waterfront is a different story altogether.

Ironically, out of all these improvements down on the waterfront, the payments to the workers have greatly improved because they are based on incentive, which is pretty basic to human nature. Now we have a case where the waterside workers have improved conditions. There are no more of the rorts, the smokos, the days off, the coming late and knocking off early and coming late, and everything else that the MUA used to institutionalise. The workers are better off than they have ever been. This is the irony of it all, because all the payments now are based on incentive.

In relation to those savings that Senator Sherry is talking about, we are on track for the savings of $1 billion that we estimated. In fact, from cluster 3, group 5—the Australian Taxation Office, the health group and group 8 contracts—over their initial five-year term, we have $265 million worth of savings. That is good news for Australian taxpayers. That is a significant achievement for this government, particularly when you take into account the significant industry development that goes along with it.

We also have more savings: in addition to the three agencies that I mentioned, three more agencies—the Department of Finance and Administration, the Australian Customs Service and the Department of Veterans' Affairs—have projected savings of approximately $100 million over the initial five-year period of their contracts. The Auditor's report was looking at this initial phase of implementation. When you look at our savings over a longer period and realise that we are just under halfway through—the $1 billion that I mentioned is projected over seven years—we are on track for these savings, and they are savings which benefit the Australian taxpayers.

This week we have been debating the alternative policy, the roll-back policy, in this chamber. And not once this week—and not once, actually, since 1 July—has a Labor senator stood up and used the dreaded R word, `roll-back'. And no wonder, because the policy is simply unpopular in the wider community. It causes great uncertainty, and people do not want Labor to proceed with roll-back. In contrast to the quietness of Labor on roll-back in recent weeks, before 1 July every time their leader got up and spoke on the radio or TV roll-back was mentioned.

As to affecting operational performance, forgive me, but I feel like I am in an SBS movie. The seizure rates for the Federal Police are so far in excess of anything ever achieved under Labor, so far in excess of anything ever achieved with the lousy funding that Labor gave them, that I cannot believe someone would have the nerve to stand up and say, `Maybe you are not doing as well.'

Then they signed up a whole lot of them on 10-year contracts which had—guess what?—an incentive to leave for those people with a mortgage and with kids at school.

Quite clearly, there is a qualification attached to that, and that is that we want to be sure that it is still achieving the objectives that were put in place at the time. My understanding is that this was always part of the NCP review process. It is quite clearly appropriate for the government to ensure that everything is competitive. It has got a bit too competitive for you, Senator Schacht, and it is very sad that you will be off to that retirement village shortly. Nonetheless, competition is a very important aspect of many parts of life, and we think it has its place in this area as well. We know Senator Woodley would much prefer cosy little arrangements that never saw the light of day.

I know he is very interested in innovation, unlike those opposite. One of Australia's most creative and innovative industries is indeed the biotechnology industry. A recent report by the CSIRO and the Australian Research Council showed that Australian biotechnology patents taken out in the US have increased 249 per cent in recent years—more than double the rate of increase of such patents from the rest of the world. Australia's biotechnology industry employs 4,000 highly skilled Australians in over 200 companies and last year earned about $1 billion, half of which was from exports. It is an industry with a great potential to generate jobs in, and wealth for, this country. </para></talk.start><para>The government are giving Australia's biotechnology industry very strong support. We are contributing about $250 million per annum to fund R&amp;D in this industry, including doubling grants to the NHMRC. We have established Biotechnology Australia in my department, and we have launched a comprehensive national biotechnology strategy, with initial funding of $30 million. Some $20 million of that will go to a new biotechnology innovation fund to help bridge the commercialisation gap in this industry. We are also working closely with the states, including joint funding for the Institute for Molecular Bioscience in Queensland and Bio21 in Victoria. We also helped 35 small biotech companies participate in Biotechnica Germany '99, which helped put our industry on the world stage. So we have a very strong commitment to this industry.</para><para>You would think the opposition's new shadow minister for industry, innovation and technology, Dr Lawrence, would be a strong advocate for new knowledge based industries like biotechnology. But it is already very clear that Dr Lawrence is strongly opposed to the burgeoning biotech industry. Her recent speech on this subject, on gene technology—which I encourage all senators to read—showed that she is a strong opponent of this industry and a strong advocate against it. She is clearly a real enemy of companies in this sector of the economy. In her speech in the House of Representatives, she openly attacked gene technology innovation as more often `driven by a profit than by need'. Dr Lawrence, in this quite infamous speech—which I also encourage everybody in the biotechnology industry to read—condemned the biotechnology industry by saying:</para><quote><para>The real thrust of the genetic engineering industry is not to make Third World agriculture more productive but rather to generate profits.</para></quote><para>Well, shock, horror! How dreadful of these companies to want to generate profits. It is obvious from her speech and from everything in her record that Dr Lawrence hates companies that want to make profits. She clearly has no idea that what is absolutely essential to investment in innovation, particularly in the biotechnology industry, is the profit motive. If there is no outcome for profits, there will be no investment; if you do not have a profit motive, you do not have the investment. But it is obvious that socialists like Dr Lawrence simply do not understand that. She is entitled to hold what are clearly socialist views, because she attacks companies that want to make profits, but she is obviously ill-equipped to be the ALP spokesperson on industry, innovation and technology. That is an absolute joke, and I say to Australia's biotechnology industry: be very worried about this new shadow minister. She clearly is strongly opposed to advances in biotechnology; she is an enemy of advances in gene technology.

The competitive selection process, which involved consultancy firms from Australia and around the world, identified Shaw Pittman as the best firm for the job.

The death rate from infectious and parasitic infections is falling, the incidence and severity of diarrhoeal diseases are reducing due to improvements in environmental living conditions and socioeconomic circumstances, and the rate of indigenous infant deaths has dropped significantly since the 1970s. </para></talk.start><para>Today I would like to report another exciting initiative. This morning my colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, launched a five-minute video titled <inline font-style="italic">Making a Difference</inline> to encourage sponsorship of the masters degree program in applied epidemiology and Aboriginal health at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health at the Australian National University. Since coming to office this government has contributed $1.6 million to the development and delivery of this program. It is an exciting program, and today I had the pleasure of meeting four of the first eight graduates who will receive their degrees tomorrow. All of those who entered the program have completed the degree.</para><para>The Howard government is proud of its commitment to this program and would like to encourage the corporate and charitable sectors to match its funding. This is just a further example of the government's commitment to practical reconciliation and an indication of the seriousness with which we take the issue of indigenous affairs. The opposition have clearly demonstrated their view on indigenous affairs this week with the debacle that occurred in relation to the resignation of the previous shadow minister, the offensive toilet brush remark and the way they were falling over each other running away from taking up the portfolio.</para><para>Another good event occurred today. I had a message from Ged Williams, the director of nursing at the Alice Springs hospital, who wrote saying that the government's structured training and employment project program has resulted in three of an original seven indigenous nurses obtaining employment and permanent full-time jobs in the Territory health system. They are the very practical on the ground things that have to be done if we are going to reverse the problems that have occurred over 200 years.</para><para>The masters degree in applied epidemiology and Aboriginal health is another successful program developed in consultation with indigenous communities and officials. I would like to congratulate Professor Bob Douglas, Dr Rennie D'Souza, and Suzanne Blogg for their hard work and dedication to this program. It is a direct response to the low levels of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander graduates working in the health system. It successfully provides indigenous students with skills in epidemiology, health evaluation, project and time management, negotiation and public speaking.</para><para>The program is already proving its effectiveness. One graduate, Daniel McAullay, has conducted research on a new diabetes screening program, and as a result of his research better targeted screening programs were proposed and effective follow-up strategies were implemented. Another graduate, Christine Franks, examined a gastroenteritis outbreak among visitors to a central Australian Aboriginal community. Her research pointed to cultural and ethical issues that must be addressed in the future. The program is significant for its potential to produce graduates able to address the complexities of indigenous public health issues and promote research and evaluation in a cross-cultural context.

I stress that: it was the second commissioner from the Taxation Office who has raised the issues about employee benefits and the possible avoidance of up to $2 billion a year in tax. Apparently, in giving evidence to a federal parliamentary committee Mr D'Ascenzo outlined the problems of tax avoidance in this area. He pointed out that in the guise of employee benefit arrangements a number of high income earners are able to avoid fringe benefits tax and a range of superannuation taxes and are able to permanently defer tax by profit stripping and by what is known as total tax wipe-outs. These forms of abuse of the tax system and very serious tax minimisation and avoidance—up to $2 billion a year—need to be distinguished from what are known as division 13A share plans, which allow tax deferral for up to 10 years and are seen as legitimate.</para><para>What is of concern to the Labor opposition is that there is potential for further growth in the probable $2 billion a year tax avoidance in this area, because recently a parliamentary inquiry chaired by the Liberal member of parliament, Dr Nelson, in the other place has apparently recommended an extension of these schemes. This, of course, would lead to an absolute bonanza for the promoters of these schemes. Effectively, you have a prominent Liberal backbencher recommending an extension, rather than a crack down, on these schemes.</para><para>In 1994, proposals were first mooted by Treasury to crack down on tax minimisation in this area. The Acting Treasurer, Senator Kemp, sought to avoid the answers to the questions today by reflecting incorrectly on Senator Cook and Senator Cook's time as a minister. Senator Kemp apparently forgot the role of the now Treasurer, Mr Costello, in the context of those reforms in 1994. It was Mr Costello who very strongly opposed reforms in this area to attempt to wipe out the very major tax avoidance that is occurring—tax avoidance, I might say, that has been highlighted by the evidence of none other than a senior officer, the tax office's second commissioner, Mr D'Ascenzo.</para><para>In his response, the Acting Treasurer, Senator Kemp, could really only make two relevant points. One was that he maintained that the current law is effective to strike down abusive schemes. Then why isn't it happening? If the current law is effective, why is this massive abuse of up to $2 billion a year occurring? And apparently it is growing. But the response of the Treasurer and the response in the chamber today by the Acting Treasurer, Senator Kemp, stand in stark contrast to Mr D'Ascenzo's recommendations. Mr D'Ascenzo, who is in a position to know, has said that systematic solutions are the best. He was asked at the parliamentary committee inquiry whether this meant legislation, and he said: </para><quote><para>Good legislation which provides the policy intent is always the best vehicle to have a good tax system.</para></quote><para>But apparently the Treasurer and the Acting Treasurer, Senator Kemp, believe that there is no need to legislate in this area, when up to $2 billion in revenue is being lost.

These are the people who I recall, back in 1982-83, created an issue out of the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. They were elected in 1983. I want to talk about their policy going into the 1983 election. Madam Deputy President, you probably go to Labor Party conferences and, like all of us, are waiting to see the tax policy. Senator Sherry has said on a number of occasions in this place over the last couple of years, `You'll see a tax policy next year' or, `You'll see a policy at the Hobart conference.' The Hobart conference has come and gone; Mr Della Bosca has come and gone; Senator Sherry is still here, and the tax policy is yet to emerge. We had 13 years of Labor. In 1983 they went to an election. They were elected with Mr Hawke and Mr Keating. After nearly 100 years of federation, they then set about 13 years of the worst economic management in Australian history, designing budgets that had the effect of, on average, $10 billion deficits, year on year, for nine out of 13 years. And they did nothing at all about tax avoidance—an enormous failure. What did they do? What was their tax policy going into the 1983 election? They had the same tax policy they have now. They sort of said, `We'll just wait. We'll wait until the next conference or the next conference.' But they had what Mr Beazley tends to have as a substitute for policy. It is a copy of the old Bob Hawke policy approach; that is, `Let's have a meeting. Let's have a conference. Let's have a summit,' whatever the nomenclature was at that era in the political cycle. Now, if we are talking about native title, Mr Beazley says, `We'll put everyone in a room and see if you can come up with a policy.'</para></talk.start><para>Back in 1984 they had the tax summit. To Mr Keating's great and enduring credit, he designed a comprehensive reform of the tax system, which he and his supporters at that time called the BBCT—the broad based consumption tax. What did Mr Keating say was one of the great benefits of the broad based consumption tax which would have, to the great embarrassment of the Australian Labor Party, reduced the excise on fuel? What would it have done, Mr Whip? It would have put a BBCT on top of the excise. That is exactly what they are getting their knickers in a knot about now: the way in which tax reform was introduced in Australia in relation to the excise on petrol. What Mr Keating wanted to do in 1984 was reduce the excise on fuel and put the broad based consumption tax—the VAT or the GST, as it is known now—on top of the excise. </para><para>Another thing they did in 1984 was to bring in indexation. We do not know where they stand in relation to indexation now. That was their policy then. They said, `Let's have a broad based consumption tax.' What was one of the great achievements to be gained from broad based consumption tax reform, proudly championed for month after month by former Prime Minister, then Treasurer, Paul Keating—undermined by the Luddites of the union movement? It was stifled. It fell at the last hurdle, to Mr Keating's great aggravation and anger at the time. The great advance of the broad based consumption tax, proposed by Mr Keating at the tax summit, was to have done what? It was to cut out tax evasion. That was their one policy platform; it was the one leg of the policy that could have attacked tax evasion. But they did not have the ticker then to get the policy in. Mr Keating did not have the numbers. Mr Hawke did not have the ticker. It is one of the things that he has handed down: he has handed the torch on to Mr Beazley. There are two things that Mr Beazley and Mr Hawke have in common: instead of having a policy, they have a meeting; and instead of having a backbone, they have jelly. They have got no policies now. Senator Sherry must be humiliated that there is no tax policy. Mr Beazley has now said he has got some policies, but he is going to keep them in the bottom drawer and not show them to anybody. He is either embarrassed about their lack of quality, their lack of substance, or he is scared to show them to people because they might be too scary, like the tax on four-wheel drives. Show us your tax policy, Senator Sherry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>17582</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was another amazing contribution. I have heard Senator Ian Campbell give some reasonable contributions in this place, but that certainly was not one of them. We are taking note of the answer by the Acting Treasurer, Senator Kemp, to a question from Senator Cook. One of the interesting comments that Senator Kemp made was about Senator Cook's ability in terms of the limbo and putting the bar so low, et cetera. I say to the Acting Treasurer that he has put the bar so low for tax avoiders—those wealthy, fat executives—in terms of tax evasion that they are stepping right over it. These real smart tax planners are stepping over the bar. They do not have to go over it; they just step right over it and keep on going. When you compare that government action with how they are treating the general population of this country, it is a stark comparison. On the one hand, you are whacking them around the ears with your new GST on anything and everything, and you have upped the price of petrol. You claim to have given them a bit back in a tax deduction but, in general, in terms of people paying their fair share of tax, what have you done? Very little. </para></talk.start><para>If we look at the record—and this goes to the heart of Senator Campbell's contribution—back in 1994-95 we proposed legislation to stamp out tax avoidance, but who opposed it? Well, you would not know it, but it was the good old Treasurer of today—not the Acting Treasurer, although he would have been in there boots and all opposing it as well. When they won office, the bill that we had introduced was sitting there. What did they do with it? They dropped it. They let it go. They then further watered down our anti-avoidance trust loss measures and they have failed to crack down on any of that sort of thing since. Let us not forget the GST exemption that you gave high rollers such as your Crown Casino mates. They are your contributions.</para><para>We always hear from the government of the day about what they think we did when we were in government. They need to be reminded that they are the government of the day, they have the responsibility, they are the decision making body, and they are the ones who are allowing billions of dollars in tax to be avoided. Senator Sherry pointed out a very good article on page 34 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review </inline>titled `Deja vu' with a photo of the Treasurer sitting there with his head in his hands. Of course the tax office is under a significant amount of pressure, and Michael D'Ascenzo raised the issue that there is a clear need for appropriate legislation. Legislative measures will always solve these sorts of problems. Even John Ralph made recommendations. Despite the fact that the government gave a commitment to the opposition that they would implement the Ralph reforms in full, they have not. They have clearly failed to do that. They reneged on a commitment that they gave to the shadow Treasurer and to us as the opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—It is a limbo dance solution.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—It very much is, Senator Sherry; it is the limbo dance solution. But, as I said, the bar is so low here for smart tax promoters that they are just stepping clearly over it. It is not just in the area of EBAs; it is also in the area of other mass marketed schemes. It has been put by some experts that, in the agribusiness area alone, over $1 billion a year is lost to revenue. That is just in that area, let alone what is happening in the EBA area. Then you go to the private binding ruling system. Of course some legislative changes that the government have made might deal with future problems, but they will not deal with those that have already been given a private binding ruling. That is what the government are trying to protect; they are trying to protect their mates who are in RPC. It would be very interesting to find out just how much of the RPC dollars go into financing the Liberal Party and the coalition parties.

That did not turn the tide at all. It simply looked like what it was: nothing more than an election stunt. The Labor government tried to convince the people of Australia in that 1996 election—which they lost in a landslide—that after 13 years they were finally going to get on to the tax avoidance industry, and it is an industry, without doubt. There are tax avoiders out there who make their living out of giving advice. When we were elected, we took up Mr Willis's list of those top 500 trust companies and the tax department have audited, as far as I can tell, just about every name Mr Willis produced on that list. Every single one of them was followed up by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. It was no stunt, and we did raise several hundred million dollars.

It is also interesting to note that that was discovered by the pursuit of the pet hate of people on the other side—the trade union movement—when they pursued a union through the royal commission and found that all the crooks were on the other side of the fence. They were not the Painters and Dockers; all the crooks were running around in white shoes on the Gold Coast making all sorts of rorts out of the tax system because of all the loopholes that were there. That happened under that Liberal government. </para></talk.start></continue><para>What has happened under this government? The article is true when it says that the current Treasurer has done nothing about these schemes. Not only has he done nothing, but he has also resisted taking any action in respect of them. He has done nothing about trusts and tax evasion and avoidance. He has done nothing about the alienation of personal services. As Senator Murphy says, the government introduced business tax reforms. But all of the commitments about limiting and wiping out evasion were all modified at the last moment, making those business tax reforms revenue neutral in terms of their impact upon the economy. You have never, ever had the courage as a government or as a party to stand up to those people in our community who basically support your side of the chamber and who do engage in an industry of ripping off this country every day, seven days a week, its rightful share of the tax take. There are people who get succour from the fact that your government will not use its legislative measures in order to challenge what they do. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Am I allowed to have another go?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—No you are not, Senator McGauran.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>17585</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title><page.no>17585</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>17585</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>17585</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled <inline font-style="italic">World debt: report on the proceedings of a seminar, Canberra, 27 August 1999</inline>, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JCFDAT) Report: World Debt - A report on the proceedings of a seminar 27 August 1999</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 1</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends the Government's continued support for the HIPC Initiative and Review.</inline></para><para>ACCEPTED.  </para><para>The Australian Government has consistently supported the HIPC Initiative as the most credible way of providing lasting debt relief to the world's poorest countries pursuing sound economic and social policies.

After a short transition period, all HIPCs will be required to have PRSPs in place before they qualify for relief under the Initiative. </para><para>1 Since the Government's pledges/contributions to the HIPC Initiative are denominated in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and US dollars, their value in Australian dollar terms will vary with exchange rate changes.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>17586</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Auditor-General's Reports</title><page.no>17586</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 8 of 2000-01</title><page.no>17586</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—In accordance with the provisions of the Auditor-General Act 1997, I present the following report of the Auditor-General: Report No. 8 of 2000-01—<inline font-style="italic">Performance Audit—Amphibious Transport Ship Program: Department of Defence.</inline></para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN WORKPLACE AGREEMENTS PROCEDURES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17587</page.no><id.no>R1107</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1106</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TALLIES AND PICNIC DAYS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1104</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1105</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee</title><page.no>17587</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>17587</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Tierney, I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Workplace Agreements Procedures) Bill 2000 and three related bills, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>17587</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17587</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a personal explanation under standing order 190.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—During question time, Senator Crowley in a question to Senator Robert Hill stated that I had been a member of another political party at some time in my life.

amendment (5) on sheet 1910:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 21 (lines 5 to 7), omit “such force against persons and things as is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances”, substitute “only such force against persons and things as is necessary to prevent an immediate threat of death or serious injury and where less extreme means are insufficient to achieve those objectives”.</para><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 21 (after line 23), at the end of section 51T, add:</para><para>	(4)	To avoid doubt, a member of the Defence Force must not use lethal force against any person unless the member believes that he or she is in immediate danger of death or serious injury and has utilized all other practical methods to deal with the situation.</para></quote><para>The purpose of proposing these two amendments is to try to bring into line the practices in the civil area, so that they will have an influence on what the government is intending to do with this legislation; that is, to take the defence forces and use them in what should be primarily a civil jurisdiction. There has been considerable debate in the chamber regarding the lack of regulations, in that the government has clearly indicated that the present regulations will be withdrawn and replaced with another set of regulations. The minister has made a commitment to make those available to the chamber. However, one of the major reasons that the government is saying that this bill needs to go through in such haste is to be available for the Olympic Games. So, either the minister has them in his back pocket and he will bring them out tomorrow, or there will be no opportunity for this chamber to review those regulations prior to the Olympic Games. This is what makes the last few amendments that have been put up by Pauline Hanson's One Nation so critical.</para><para>The essence of the first amendment to schedule 1, item 4, page 21, is to establish the situation where, no matter what action the defence forces find themselves in, they can only use force that is reasonable and necessary in relation to the circumstances. So, if we have a situation where a crowd is dispersing, the passing of this amendment would prohibit a member of the defence forces using anything other than a reasonable amount of force to apprehend that person.</para><para>The other thing that the amendment I am speaking about also brings into play is that the Defence Force can only use lethal force against a person where they themselves are under immediate threat of death or serious injury and where less extreme means are insufficient to achieve the objectives. So it does not stop a member of the defence forces protecting themselves in a case where they are under threat of their own life. It does not prohibit the defence forces from using lethal force if another person is in danger of serious injury. What it does is to very clearly put restrictions on members of the Defence Force from using excessive force in any area. The second of the amendments, item 5, on sheet 1910, says:</para><quote><para>To avoid doubt, a member of the Defence Force must not use lethal force against any person unless the member believes that he or she is in immediate danger of death or serious injury and has utilized all other practical methods to deal with the situation.</para></quote><para>As well as having the restriction of only being able to use reasonable force, lethal force is restricted until the point where all other means of carrying out the action have been exhausted. Yes, it does bring a responsibility onto the member of the defence forces, but we have to remember where this person is carrying out the action. They are carrying it out in civil life in Australia—not in another country, not against an invading threat. They have the ability to carry out this lethal force against another Australian citizen. I believe that it is very reprehensible of this committee—in the light of the fact that we have not seen any regulations relating to this bill—and absolutely unacceptable that we pass the bill in the form that it is in at this point in time, bearing in mind that the bill has been substantially altered in the progress of this committee stage. </para><para>In closing—through you, Chair—the responsibility of the Defence Force personnel under these circumstances is enormous. We need to provide to them a clear set of constraints that they must work to. The bill most certainly does not do that in its present form. It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the constraints that are placed upon our state police or the Australian Federal Police. As I said earlier, the Australian Federal Police are constrained from using lethal force against a felon who is fleeing. This bill carries no such restriction on the defence forces. I believe it should. It is for that purpose that I commend the amendments to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>17589</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree to these amendments by One Nation. The amendments provide for a clearer directive than the one in the bill to members of the armed services, when they are brought out against civilians, as to when they can kill those civilians. That is what this bill provides for. The government has, behind the desk over there, a manual that will give instructions to the armed services on how to kill Australian civilians in an emergency.

In that situation, the amendments that Senator Harris has brought forward here are at least a little bit of a direction for the worst situation imaginable—that is, where the armed services have their guns trained on Australian civilians. Senator Harris has explained the caveat that his amendments put on that situation, and that is more satisfactory than anything the government have put before us.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17589</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just for the record: the government opposes this.

The committee also recommended that, if a house is not sitting at the time the report is ready for publication, the documents be presented to the Presiding Officer of that house for circulation to members of that house. The suggested wording of any amendment to the bill to cover these two recommendations was set out in appendix 6.</para><para>These amendments expand on the publication requirements that were required by the previous provisions of the legislation. The new subsection (3), which the government intends to have introduced, will detail the requirements for reporting to parliament. It will provide that presentation to parliament of the report on the use of the Defence Force will be in accordance with the section if the report is:</para><quote><para>... forwarded to the Presiding Officer of each House:</para><para>	(a)	if that House sits before the end of 7 days after the order ... ceases to be in force—for tabling in that House before the end of that 7 days; or</para><para>	(b)	if not—before the end of that 7 days for distribution to all Senators or Members of the House of Representatives, as the case may be.</para></quote><para>That, of course, is in the case where the House or the Senate is not sitting.</para><para>Amendment No. 1 will include a definition of `Presiding Officer'. It is defined to mean the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Amendment No. 7, which deals with section 51X as well, requires the minister to arrange for publication of the orders, declarations and reports on the utilisation of the Defence Force. It provides that publication must take place in a number of ways, including tabling in parliament. That really facilitates the amendments that I have mentioned in relation to wider publication, if you like. Amendment No. 8 mirrors amendment No. 7, replacing the words `publication to take place' with `presentation to parliament'.</para><para>I commend these amendments to the chamber. They reflect the sentiments of the committee, I would submit. It is a sensible suggestion of the committee; it increases transparency and openness of process.

It would allow to some degree for that to be scrutinised by the parliament. What we are talking about now could be an extremely sombre period. We could have a situation where people have expressed their dissent to the government and the government has taken whatever action it had to in order to quell that. I believe this report will be very little recompense to a parent, a brother or a sister who has gone through the agony of having the life of somebody they love terminated—if that is the effect this bill will have, and I believe it has that potential. It may be all right for senators to use rhetoric to berate whoever ordered the troops out, but that will do very little to console anybody who has fallen foul of it.

My amendment actually changes that again to say: `laid before each house of the parliament, and published on the department's web site, or otherwise publicly released'. So this amendment ensures that it is published on the web site. While I take the government's assurance that that is something they are interested in, I think in the new age of innovation and technology, which the Labor Party has found a new commitment to, it would be very sensible to ensure that it is published on a web site. Apart from that, it also puts in a couple of extra paragraphs which would outline how the report could be published if we were in the middle of, or if it was just after, an election. It says what would happen if the House had been dissolved and a newly elected House had not met. It takes that into account and then says what the Presiding Officer can do to avoid doubt.</para><para>Basically, it is a matter of drafting.

It adds on that the report is required to be published on the web site. It says you can otherwise publicly release it—I take their point about that—but it also adds those other clauses that say what to do in the event of parliament not rolling along as we usually do. Of course, every three years something happens that interrupts us—rudely. I am not looking forward to the next time we are interrupted, but it will happen.

It is the option of the committee to accept or reject any information that is put before it. A report brought down by a committee does not necessarily have to reflect the input of whoever puts arguments to that committee. I am not implying that the committees go out of their way to ignore the evidence put before them; I am merely highlighting the fact that extremely good recommendations can be made to Senate committees by way of evidence that are not taken up by the committee. Speaking to Senator Bourne's amendment, I believe that it is effective because it speaks of the periods when the house is in recess. I spoke earlier of periods when the house may even be in recess for up to six weeks. The Democrat amendment clearly sets out a process to cope with that.

We are dealing with proposed section 51X of the bill, which deals with the report which is subsequent to any action taken on any call-out. That much is agreed. We are talking about how that comes to be published and whether there is any requirement for it to be tabled in parliament. We say that the committee, which stated in its recommendations that proposed section 51X should be amended to provide for a variety of matters, had it right. The committee stated that proposed section 51X should be amended to provide for the report to be tabled in both houses of parliament within seven days of the cessation of the call-out. That is fairly clear. The committee also recommended that, if a house is not sitting at the time the report is ready for publication, the documents be presented to the Presiding Officer of that house for circulation to members of that house.</para></talk.start><para>As well as that, the committee gave the suggested wording of an amendment to the bill to cover those recommendations and set it out at appendix 6. The government took that recommendation and followed it. If I can refer to its wording, the government said—and we can look at it in context—that this is how proposed section 51X would read: `If an order under this part ceases to be in force, and the order is not one of two or more orders to which subsection (2) applies, the minister must arrange for the presentation to the parliament in accordance with subsection (3).' That part would be the first amendment. Proposed subsection (2) would say, `If two or more orders under this part about the same or related circumstances come into force in succession, without any intervening period when no such order is in force, the minister must arrange for presentation to the parliament in accordance with subsection (3).' Proposed subsection (3) would then set out the manner of presentation to parliament. It would say:</para><quote><para>For the purposes of subsection (1) or (2)—</para></quote><para>and they deal with the presentation to parliament—</para><quote><para>presentation to the Parliament of the copy and report is in accordance with this subsection if the copy and report are forwarded to the Presiding Officer of each House:</para><para>	(a)	if that House sits before the end of 7 days after the order mentioned in subsection (1) or the last of the orders mentioned in subsection (2) ceases to be in force—for tabling in that House before the end of that 7 days; or </para><para>	(b)	if not—before the end of that 7 days for distribution to all Senators or Members of the House of Representatives, as the case may be.</para></quote><para>Of course, what you have at the moment in (a) is `where the house is sitting' and in (b) `where it is not sitting it is distributed to all members and senators'. So you basically have both aspects covered.</para><para>Of course, the Democrats are dealing with a slightly different procedure. Democrat amendment No. 8 says:</para><quote><para>(3)	For the purposes of subsection (1) or (2), publication of the copy and report takes place in accordance with this subsection if, within 7 days after the order mentioned in subsection (1) or the last of the orders mentioned in subsection (2) ceases to be in force, the copy and report are—</para></quote><para>and this is where they get into a different aspect of the procedure—</para><quote><para>	(a)	laid before each House of the Parliament; and</para><para>	(b)	published on the Department's website; or</para><para>	(c)	otherwise publicly released.</para></quote><para>That is the nub of that difference there. The amendment then states:</para><quote><para>(4) If a House of the Parliament does not meet within the period mentioned in subsection (3)—</para></quote><para>which is within seven days—</para><quote><para>or meets within that period but not after the report is ready for publication, for the purposes of that subsection the copy and report are taken to be laid before that House if they are provided to the Presiding Officer of that House for circulation to the members of that House.</para></quote><para>We have already provided that in our proposed subsection, because we say that, if the house is not sitting, the Presiding Officer merely distributes it to the members of the House of Representatives or the members of the Senate. But the other difference with the Democrat amendment is that it goes on to subclauses 4A and 4B. It then says that, if the house is dissolved and if a newly elected house has not met, there should be copies provided to the Presiding Officer, who then distributes them to those members of the parliament. That is another difference.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Members of the former parliament?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—It says here—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—No, it has to be the members of the former parliament.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—Immediately before, yes.

It is easily understandable. So, in effect, Democrat subclause 4A says that you will have circulation to those members and senators who were in the prior parliament. We believe that is covered by our amendment as well, because it would simply say `if not—before the end of that 7 days for distribution to all Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, as the case may be'. But Democrat subclause 4B carries on to say:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>To avoid doubt, the function of a Presiding Officer of receiving and circulating a copy and a report under subsection (4) is a function of the Presiding Officer for the purposes of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965</inline>.</para></quote><para>That covers their having the power, if it is dissolved, to send that out to members and senators.

So it would cover the unlikely event that there is a call-out in that short period.

I do not know that there would be any other alternative. I cannot think of one. Hence, regarding that element of Senator Bourne's amendment, while I understand the general point, in the circumstances I think the government's formulation is a better one. It is an interesting question, of course, as to what happens after an election but before the return of the writs, for example.

But we still have the situation where the Australian Federal Police are then subjected to the Ombudsman's office. If the Australian defence forces are carrying out functions identical to those of the Australian Federal Police, then it is desirable that they also be subjected to the same scrutiny as the Australian Federal Police.

As the structure of this bill has emerged and as the amendments have come through, there have been concerns expressed to me and to my staff, by way of correspondence, phone calls and emails, relating to the enormous pressure that is going to come down on the defence forces. I spoke earlier on about the situation relating to the reserves: that  they are going to find themselves in a less than desirable situation if they are ultimately called out. I most certainly hope that they never are. But if the government did not have an intention of accessing that facility, then why are they putting it in the bill in the first place? The reality of that facility being there means the probability is that it would be used.</para><para>Our defence forces are, as I said earlier on, an extremely dedicated group of people. They are extremely well trained, they are highly efficient, but they are also human beings: they have emotions and they have feelings. If the majority of people in mainstream public or private life come to a situation where we disagree with something that we are asked to do, under normal circumstances we can decline to do it and resign whatever position we fill. That is an option that is available to anybody who, as I said, works in the public or private sector. Our defence forces are, however, in a different situation. They make a commitment to serve this country for a period of time. I would ask the minister to correct me if I am incorrect in my understanding that, if Defence Force personnel have a conscientious objection to an order that they are instructed to carry out, the only option they have is to wilfully disobey that order, which ultimately would result in a dishonourable discharge. I seek clarification from the minister as to whether I am correct in that assertion. </para><para>We are bringing in a bill that will be retrospective for every service person who presently is operating in our defence forces. If  this bill had already been in place and people applied to join whatever portion of the Defence Force they wished to serve in, knowing that one of the duties they could be called upon to perform would be in a domestic violence situation, that would be one situation. They could consciously decide whether they wanted to be part of that force, knowing that there was a possibility of them being called out in a case of domestic violence. But that is not reality; the reality is that we have a functioning defence force. With this bill, this government will impose on those personnel a responsibility that they did not have when they signed up.</para><para>I believe that the only way the government could be honourable in this particular situation—and I stress that it only relates to the situation where the defence forces are called out under this section of the act—is for those personnel who have a conscientious objection to being ordered to stand in line against their own countrymen to be afforded the ability to conscientiously object to that order and remain within the forces. If we do not provide our defence forces with that ability, the only option that I can see is that the government will face a situation where considerably fewer people will sign up for our defence forces. Also, those well-trained personnel who currently are in our defence forces will, at the end of their present terms, not sign up again. I would not blame them if they chose the latter course. I believe that it is incumbent on this government—having brought in this legislation that you could only describe as being retrospective in relation to their service period, bringing on this extremely emotional situation—to change it. This is the reason I have brought this amendment forward. It is not intended to put in place a procedure so that, in time of war, there would be a straight opt-out for a conscientious objector; it is purely for the function of the act, when it is amended by this bill, in relation to the defence forces being called out in a domestic violence process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>17598</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Harris has asked two questions. Firstly, in relation to conscientious objection and time of service, I think Senator Harris was saying that, if a member of the Defence Force is faced with a problem, they are stuck with a set time of service. It is open for a member of the ADF to resign. With officers there is a three-month period of notice required. That set period of service is no longer in place; it is open to a member of the Australian Defence Force to resign—it is a free choice. With respect to conscientious objection, there is provision in time of war, where you have a call-up situation under section 60 of the Defence Act, for there to be a conscientious objection. There is also provision for a Conscientious Objection Tribunal. That is quite clearly set out in the Defence Act, and it is something which the government says is appropriate.</para></talk.start><para>This proposal by Senator Harris goes further. It says that, for a particular task, a person in the ADF might have the ability to object on conscientious grounds to taking part in the call-out. Certainly, the government would say that any unlawful order is not a binding order on a member of the ADF. So you start with that premise: if any member of the ADF is given a manifestly unlawful order, they do not have to follow that, and they are given instruction and training on that. But to extend it to conscientious objection could really open up all sorts of problems if you had an emergency—and call-outs by their very nature relate to emergencies. The government would say that it would not be workable in those circumstances to evaluate or test that conscientious objection. That would not be possible in the circumstances.</para><para>The final aspect relates to the previous question Senator Harris put to me, and I just have to place the answer on record. He referred to those series of orders in 51X, and I refer there to subclause (2), which states:</para><quote><para>If 2 or more orders under this Part about the same or related circumstances come into force in succession, without any intervening period when no such order is in force, the Minister must arrange for publication to take place— </para></quote><para>Senator Harris mentioned three orders being made which related to the same situation. The report would relate to that first order. However, you would not have three separate reports for the three separate orders, and I want to make this clear, through the chair to Senator Harris, because there may have been some misunderstanding earlier on both our parts. Where you have an order which relates to, say, a hijacking, that order remains in force. If that problem is still at hand—for example, the plane might have moved elsewhere—another order is made which refreshes it, if you like, and keeps it going for another 20 days. Another order, in Senator Harris's example, would be a third order being made without an intervening period, so in effect you have 60 days of order. There would be only one reporting to parliament and that would be at the conclusion of the incident. The thinking behind that is that, whilst you are dealing with an ongoing matter—and the government would say that it would be very rare that you would have a situation in existence for that long, but it is not inconceivable in the realm of human affairs—to give a report as to what you are doing might jeopardise the operation. So provided the order is about the same or related circumstances, you would not report until the matter had been concluded. If you had three totally different matters, it is a different story. You would report for each matter. The circumstance that Senator Harris asked about related to matters which were the same or related, so in that case you would have the one report for the lot. I think, Senator Harris, I have answered your questions on the length of tenure and resignation from the services, I have answered your previous question on those orders, and I have put on the record the government's opposition to the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>17599</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—But the minister has failed to give an adequate response to the reasons for this amendment by Senator Harris.

Senator Harris says we need to give young Australians the opportunity to opt out if politicians send them in armed to a situation where they will be potentially shooting their fellow Australians. The minister says, `No, that's all right. We've got a Conscientious Objection Tribunal that's available in time of war.' But as soon as he is tested, we find that that is not available under these circumstances because it will not be a war. The question that Senator Harris's amendment posed for the government is: how dare you leave it open to politicians to send in members of the Australian defence forces against their fellows in this country who are on strike or protesting and not give them the option of conscientious objection?</para></talk.start><para>One thing the minister is right about is that this is not war. This will be, by the nature of it, civil war. This will be where martial law has been declared by one, two or three politicians in this place. The troops will be sent in at the orders of those politicians to be able to shoot to kill Australians, armed or unarmed. We have failed to get protection to the civilians in this case. Senator Harris's amendment is trying to give some protection to the defence forces. I suspect his office, like Senator Bourne's and like mine, has had indications from serving or past members of the defence forces that they do not want to be part of this process. They do not want to be sent in against fellow Australians because some politicians think there is an emergency and somebody's property is at stake. The troops could go in just because some corporate interest believes they should be brought out and he makes a call to these politicians and puts a case which convinces them. That situation for the use of troops is available under this open-door legislation. Does the minister think there will not be a member of the Australian defence forces under those circumstances who will conscientiously object to being used in that way? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17600</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to stop the minister from answering that question, because I want to hear the answer, too. But I want to make a couple of points about Senator Harris's amendment, which I think is a very important amendment and one that we will be supporting. The minister mentioned a couple of things—conscientious objection during times of war, which of course is irrelevant; provision of a board, which is irrelevant. He also mentioned that unlawful orders do not have to be followed. I am glad to hear that, but unfortunately when this bill goes through, if it is constitutional, it will make lawful an order to shoot an Australian dead by a member of the Australian Defence Force under some circumstances. Members of the Defence Force have rung my office and have said that they do not want to do that, that they really hate this bill and they do not want to do it. Members have rung radio stations while I have been doing talkback and have said the same thing. Members of the Australian Defence Force—not just the ones who have rung my office and Senator Brown's office and Senator Harris's office; that would be a tiny percentage of the ones who do not want to do it—do not want to be put in that position. I think it is really important that we do not put a member of the Australian Defence Force in the position that they are forced against their will to shoot dead another Australian. I think that is really important. They should be able to conscientiously object. I am well and truly in favour of Senator Harris's amendment because of that.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>17600</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I made it clear previously that conscientious objection only related to a call-up situation in time of war.

This legislation will not provide a situation where any member of the ADF will have to follow a manifestly unlawful order. That remains, and it is part of the training of members of the ADF that they do not have to follow manifestly unlawful orders. The government believes that these conscientious objection provisions go further than it believes is appropriate, which I have outlined in any event. The government believes that to allow conscientious objection would interfere with the operational aspect of a call-out.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>17600</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It would not get anywhere but, in lieu of the provision under the Defence Act 1903 that a magistrate had to accompany the defence forces into action against civilians, we ought to move an amendment here that says that in those circumstances the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the Minister for Defence, Mr Moore, and the Attorney-General be the three citizens at the front of this column when it is sent in against Australian citizens.

I believe the minister has clearly said to us that previously a three-month period came into play when an officer of the Defence Force chose to resign. I believe the minister clearly has said that that is no longer the case. Can the minister also indicate that all ranks from private through to officer also have the freedom to resign if they do not wish to continue to be members of the defence forces? Senator Bourne picked up on the same issue that I was going to speak on—that is, in reply, the minister clearly indicated that Australian defence personnel were not obliged to follow a manifestly unlawful order. When this rowdy mob is facing a soldier on the corner of a street, where is the soldier going to find his legal adviser who can tell him that the order is manifestly unlawful? Because I cannot see that any QCs would be standing around the corner when someone is shooting at them.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment that I propose has more intent than for Defence Force personnel to conscientiously object. It actually gives them the option to stay in the force, and this is what I am trying to get across to the minister. From this point on, I believe—and the minister can correct me—that if the defence forces, under their duty of care (I emphasise, under their duty of care) do not clearly and succinctly tell every person at the point when they apply to become a member of the Defence Force that it is possible that they could be called out to quell domestic violence or anything in excess of that, the Commonwealth would be failing in its duty of care to those persons, and there should be sufficient retribution by those persons back on the department. After the passing of this bill and its gazettal as an act, if the government, every member of the Defence Force and every person in the Department of Defence do not clearly and succinctly tell these people what their obligations are, they will be in default of their obligation and their duty of care. It is as clear as that. This is what the government is doing, and it had better stop and have a think about it.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harris's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.[ </para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.M.

This major defect in the bill, whilst obviously apparent to the crossbenches, was also apparent to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is famous—not notorious—in the Senate for being an objective, non-partisan and fearlessly diligent committee when looking at the issue of liberties, powers and processes which are inadequate in terms of protecting the community. I want to refer the committee to the 11th Scrutiny of Bills report of 2000, presented on 28 August 2000, and to pages 313 and 314, which held the conclusions. In the penultimate paragraph, they had this to say:</para><quote><para>In this sense, the process of clarification is incomplete. One way in which this process should be continued is for the bill to require that procedures or protocols be developed which address the relationship between the Defence Force and the public for public scrutiny.</para></quote><para>I think those remarks by the committee should be taken to heart by the government and the opposition. Essentially, the committee was saying that legislation can only provide the framework and the authority for Defence Force deployment on our streets. But the way in which the Defence Force behave will be determined by the nature of the training, regulations and procedures that they are provided with.</para><para>It is obviously not the place for legislation to put detailed standing orders into place. It is not the place for legislation to try to foresee all the ways in which training or the use of force should be exercised. It is the proper place for that to be in manuals, protocols and administrative procedures. However, having said that, we were faced with the danger that, in some circumstances, these things justifiably might need to be kept secret. There is absolutely no point in having an antiterrorism plan which is a public document for terrorists to read, nor in having antiterrorist procedures and orders which were public documents. So, whilst this amendment does in fact make, as with all such matters, these proposed administrative procedures and orders disallowable instruments, it specifically excludes those administrative procedures and orders which are developed in connection with the national antiterrorist plan. We think that is an appropriate way to go and an appropriate safeguard. </para><para>So what do these administrative procedures and orders attempt to do? They attempt to address the very real fear that has been expressed again and again over these last four days by the crossbenchers—and, in passing, may I congratulate particularly Senators Bourne, Brown and Harris for carrying the load of that campaign on behalf of all members of the crossbenches. In particular, they have been saying throughout this debate that the culture, the training and the nature of the Defence Force makes them unlikely—and, in fact, dangerous—people to be on the streets of our cities without the appropriate legislative safeguards and without the appropriate safeguards in terms of procedures and orders. Most primarily, as has been said again and again, this is because Defence Force members are not trained to deal with members of the public; they are trained to kill the enemy. Therefore, the way in which they operate should be carefully managed.</para><para>I would draw attention to an area of activity which over the last two or three decades we have all been conscious of, and that is the streets of Northern Ireland. With all the necessity for the troops to be on the streets of Northern Ireland, and with all the backbone and background that the people acting in that capacity have had, there have still been occasions where Defence Force people have behaved utterly improperly, such occasions having resulted in public outrage which has rocked all the way through Northern and Southern Ireland, rocked all the way through the British Isles and outraged the world. That is where Defence Force people have overstepped the mark and behaved improperly. You have to try, through your administrative procedures and orders, your systems and your legislative backing, to limit the occasions when soldiers will behave in the wrong way.</para><para>From the perspective of the crossbenches, we believe that there should be approved administrative procedures and orders for the training of Defence Force members on a call-out; for the relationship between Defence Force members and members of the civilian forces on a call-out; for the use of force by Defence Force members; for the exercise of search and entry powers by Defence Force members; for the issuing of weapons to Defence Force members, and for the use of those weapons by Defence Force members; for the rights and obligations of persons detained by Defence Force members to be spelt out; for the evidentiary use—and I should remind you that that particular clause has been occasioned by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report as well—that may be made of any statements made by persons while held in detention by Defence Force members; and for the content of reports to the parliament following the cessation of a call-out.</para><para>It is my expectation—based on what I have heard the minister say over the last few days, and from what I know of the forces generally—that a number of matters would be covered by them and that they would be doing these things. In our concern at the excessive discretion and authority that are at the heart of this flawed bill, we are asking that these administrative procedures and orders, these manuals and these protocols—where they are not developed in terms of the national antiterrorist plan—be made available to the parliament as disallowable instruments. In that way, we may have regard to their applicability and their suitability for the processes that they are to be used in.</para><para>We believe that this amendment should go without saying. We believe that this is the kind of amendment that a reasonable government would accept; an unreasonable government would not accept it. I say to the government: if you do not accept this legislation and the time comes when we get the opportunity to review it, we will try and make sure that these sorts of provisions are included in it. So with those remarks—and I have tried not to speak at length, because I think a lot of people have heard a lot of words on this bill—I commend the amendment to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>17603</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do think just very briefly a response is warranted on the Democrat amendment on administrative procedures and orders—and I will be brief, but I do not want to not respond to a substantive question that is before the chair.

However, I did pick up what Senator Faulkner had to say, and that was that the Labor Party is agreeing with the government against the public interest yet again on this legislation. This brings us back at the end of these amendments to the core problem with this Labor-Liberal legislation—that is, it is not about antiterrorism per se; it is about having a go at Australian civilians in an unrestricted range of events and the inevitability that that is going to happen for political purposes. We ought to be having two bills. One should be about terrorism, where I believe we would get a much greater degree of consensus in this place, and the other should be about calling the troops out against Australians—Australian civilians who are on strike, who are protesting or who dissent from the government of the day. That is the key word that is in this manual and some of the information that Labor is going to support the government in suppressing by denying this amendment.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrat amendment simply says: where you are going to use the troops against civilians, let us see the guiding order, the guiding hand, on that. Surely you are going to have to tell the troops and, if you are going to tell them, you should be telling everybody. This is a public matter of the highest order and the public deserve to be informed. I do not trust orders that guide troops against Australian civilians which cannot be brought before this place. I do not trust them. Labor do and the Liberals do—it will be one of those two parties that sends in the troops when the time comes. It surely should be a matter of public obligation that the rules that guide the use of troops in those extraordinary circumstances should be subject to scrutiny by the parliament and disallowance. I have read to the parliament sections of the current defence standing orders which we are told will be changed as soon as this legislation is through this place. As I said, the government have got it over there behind the desk, but they are not going to show us.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—How do you know that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Commonsense tells me that, Senator.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—You haven't seen it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Let me put it this way: not even the Howard government could draw up from scratch the complicated new set of regulations that would be required for the troops to be used during the Olympics between now and opening day.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—And the training that has to ensue.

I believe that is incorrect. If the amendment as it stands is passed, the amendment would put in the bill the framework of the regulations that would control and guide the Australian defence forces when operating under this section of the act. I do not believe that any words in the Democrats amendment indicate that the actual content of those different areas has to be put into the public arena. But it does set out—and I think properly—the framework that those regulations must cover. It briefly sets out the requirement that there must be regulations on the use of force. It sets out that there must be clear instructions on the exercise of search and entry powers. It clearly sets out that there must be regulations that pertain to the issuing of weapons to the defence forces. It is very obvious that that same regulation should require very clear and concise instructions on what and how those weapons are to be used. </para></talk.start><para>The amendment would also require the setting out of the rights of Defence Force members. I believe that is as equally important as clearly setting out what their obligations are. Then it moves into an area where I believe the bill is extremely deficient—instructions for the Defence Force on how they are to collect or preserve evidence and statements relating to any persons they hold. So, far from actually putting into the public arena sensitive information, I believe this amendment very concisely sets out the framework that the regulations should follow and it will ensure clarity for the Australian Defence Force should they be required to follow an order under this legislation.</para><para>If the government and the opposition had realistically looked at the amendments that have been put forward this week in relation to this bill and agreed to include in the bill clear and concise instructions relating to these issues, to a degree this amendment would not be as essential as it is at this point. But because of the concerns of the public of Australia, this amendment by the Democrats is absolutely essential. It is essential for the people of Australia who know what conditions will apply relating to domestic violence; it is essential for the Defence Force so that they will know how to act in a fit and proper manner; and it is essential for any judiciary that might be called in to make a decision about any claims of impropriety or excessive force on the part of the Defence Force. The amendment does not in any way require the placement of sensitive information in a public place. What it does very clearly is set out what the regulations must address.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17605</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the record, the government opposes this proposed amendment, which deals with administrative procedures and orders. It can understand the motivation to move this amendment, as stated by Senator Murray, but the government has already given an undertaking that the revised manual dealing with those division 3 powers will be tabled. Division 2 relates more to antiterrorist activity, and that has been discussed on numerous occasions in this committee. We have said that there are some sensitive operational matters which should not be made public. But the manual that, in particular, Senator Brown has canvassed at length will be revised and tabled, and it is appropriate that it be done. As well as that, there is ministerial control over the manual and there is the accountability of the responsible minister to parliament. So there is adequate transparency and accountability in relation to the subject matter of that manual and the formulation of it.</para></talk.start><para>What the government do have some concern about here is that the procedures and orders contained in this amendment relate to a variety of matters which are operational or which could well touch on a range of issues which deal with division 2 powers. The question of security comes into play here because the government would say that we do not want to have a blueprint publicly available which provides to the world at large the training, the weapons and the general modus operandi that would apply in a division 2 situation. We feel that this would be inappropriate. We do say that this amendment really is covered by the manual we have undertaken to table and which will be revised on the passing of this bill. That manual is comprehensive. Senator Brown has quoted from various parts of it. The manual he has referred to will be defunct, and a new one will be drafted insofar as it relates to a call-out, and that is something the minister has control over. For those reasons the government would oppose this amendment and would say that mechanisms are currently in place which have that transparency but which at the same time protect the security or operational matters which are sensitive.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>17605</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister referred to division 2.

The reason I say that we should cut to the chase is that this amendment has been before the government for four days.

One of the most discerning aspects of this proposed piece of legislation that concerns me deeply is the covert subversion of the Australian Constitution. Under section 119, the Commonwealth is directed to only intervene in the protection of the states and territories at the behest of the states and territories. It was never intended in the Australian Constitution to subvert the powers of the states and territories to the Commonwealth, and this bill does just that. The ability of the Commonwealth government to have the Australian people subjected to their own Defence Force was never envisaged by our forefathers. The calling out of the military forces upon our own people reeks of the potential for a military coup by incumbent governments at some point of time.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

The criteria for calling into operation of the bill involve the enforcement of Commonwealth laws to protect Commonwealth property or facilities and persons connected with the Commonwealth. This is the exact charter that brought about the existence of the Australian Federal Police. Considering we already have this institution in place—taking into consideration its understaffing and its handicapping by diminishing funding, and that is thanks largely to this government's obsession with budget surpluses—the question arises as to what the future of the Australian Federal Police is. If it is not to be included in these circumstances, then what is the future for the Australian Federal Police? A more timely question is: why have they been excluded?</para><para>Since 1979, following the Hilton bombing, SAC-PAV—that is, the Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth-State Cooperation for Protection Against Violence—was brought into being to protect Australia from major terrorist incidents. This group comprises representatives from both state and Commonwealth governments, including attorneys-general, the Prime Minister and cabinet, the Australian Federal Police, the military and other committee members. SAC-PAV appears to be a comprehensive representation of those who would be involved, in the event of a major terrorist attack. At no time does this institution downgrade the rights of the states. In actuality, it reinforces them, because the states are involved. SAC-PAV does not degrade the rights of the states and territories and their relevant institutions by imposing other structures above and beyond the existing ones. Why is the government proposing to only partially use SAC-PAV's potential?</para><para>SAC-PAV is already committed to supporting the upcoming Olympics under the guidance of the national antiterrorist plan. Both the state and territory police have agreed to cooperate with SAC-PAV with personnel and equipment should the need arise. As SAC-PAV has been in operation and training for 21 years, I hardly think they would be unable to handle any situation that would arise in the event of a terrorist attack. So why is the government proposing to introduce a third antiterrorist unit?</para><para>Should the situation ever arise under the very dubious definition of `lawful protest or dissent'—whatever that should mean—there already exists, under very strict operational guidelines, the provision to second members of the police force under the operation of the Australian Federal Police in the application of their duties. The same guidelines do not appear to be applicable to the military under this bill, and this concerns me greatly—that one group, the state police, are operating under one regime while the military is exempt from that same regime. There already exists in our history the use of military in assisting the state and federal police forces in times of crisis or emergency situations. This has been very satisfactory use of these personnel under the circumstances, and I see no reason why that should not continue to be adequate.</para><para>The proposed passing of this bill by the government is causing a great deal of concern in the community. I have been bombarded in my office by people who are angry, perplexed, perturbed and irate at the idea that the Australian military should ever be given the opportunity to point arms at its own people and on Australian soil. This bill certainly permits this. Given that the purpose of the military is to terminate or neutralise an enemy, while that of both the state and federal police forces is to protect the community, it is obvious that these two units have been formed with operational agendas that are an antithesis of each other. There are many incidents in history of governments abusing the power of the military to terrorise their people, with Mexico and Tiananmen Square being examples. The Australian people are well aware of these abuses and will not take lightly the imposition of this legislation upon them. The government has yet to adequately explain the reasons why present arrangements for security are inadequate. Why is it necessary to pass this bill, creating a third antiterrorist force? The bill is riddled with uncertainties, some contradictions, excessiveness and unanswered questions, and in no way is its passage justified. </para><para>So far we have heard answers that I believe do not withstand scrutiny. The bill is for domestic violence when it should be exclusively for acts of terrorism. It concentrates power in Canberra. As well as doing that, in the committee stage of this bill we have seen a sunset clause that has been unacceptable. The government and the opposition have chosen not to include the Australian Federal Police. They have not defined or put in the bill a definition of `reasonable force'. The government, with Labor support, have left in the bill the ability to call out reserves, who will be placed against their fellow workers. The government have refused to accept a situation where a person may wish to conscientiously object to being called out and required to fire upon their fellow citizens. The government are saying their only option is to retire or resign from the force. I believe that that is not acceptable. I believe this bill has been introduced in haste. There definitely is not sufficient time to train the personnel who will become subject to this bill between now and when the government are saying that they require to bring them into force; that is, in time for the Olympic Games. We need to be mindful that we are now standing at approximately the same place in time as were those students in Mexico when, 11 days out, the government turned the guns on them. That is a very poignant point. I most certainly sincerely hope, in concluding my comments on this bill, that we never see the day in Australia.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>17610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title><page.no>17610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the order of the Senate of today relating to the hours of meeting and routine of business for today be varied to provide that the Senate continue to sit between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm.</para></motion></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17610</page.no><id.no>R1122</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>17610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>17610</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of Senator Harris's amendment. In my view, a delay of six months would sort out quite a number of problems associated with this bill. I have not spoken on this debate so far, but I am appalled that the Senate will pass this legislation largely unamended. Much has been said about bringing out the troops against Australian citizens. I want to talk tonight about protests and the right to peaceful protests—that I think Australians imagined they had and will be further undermined by this legislation. I have been involved in several major public protests over the years, and I want to talk about how these might have been affected had the legislation been in place.</para></talk.start><para>Back in 1994, the Kennett government decided that Albert Park would be the place for a grand prix, and it set about cutting down 1,000 trees and reshaping the park to accommodate this Formula 1 race. Save Albert Park was formed to protest about the damage wrought in turning this pleasant park, enjoyed in many different ways by the local and wider community, into a park dominated by grand prix tracks, underpasses, massive steel structures and the like. These structures, as well as occupying open space, are permanent reminders that every year, for at least four months—usually it is more like six—much of the park will be taken over in preparation for, or clean up after, this event. I am a member of Save Albert Park, and I was there from day one. I was arrested for attempting to stop the consolidation of this once marshy ground to prepare for the track. Consolidation consisted of the dropping of huge concrete weights from a great height. The effect of this sent tremors underground across to the Victorian houses in Middle Park, many of which shook and were effectively coming apart at the seams. It seemed to me that the damage to these houses should not be allowed to continue just so that the least-cost construction method that had been adopted could continue. Nothing else would stop the work, and legislation put in at the time prevented citizens from taking any sort of legal action. </para><para>Peaceful protest was the only way in which some sort of justice could be provided for these people. The police were called, and people were charged with trespass in a public park and eventually physically removed from the site. Under this legislation, supported by the two major parties, it would have been a simple matter for the federal government to decide that this international event was so important to Australia's standing that it should intervene. The risk of injury could easily have been demonstrated. All that was needed was to start up the cranes and wave these huge concrete blocks around in the air. One compaction alone could have killed at least 10 people.</para><para>The ALP amendment says that protests, dissents, assembly or industrial action are not actions in which the Army can intervene `except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons, or serious damage to property'. These protesters putting themselves into danger could have been moved by defence forces without the niceties of charges being laid and people being taken to the station in an orderly fashion, as pretty much did happen. The charges were also dismissed pretty much in an orderly fashion on the grounds that the police exceeded their authority to make the arrests. The magistrate argued in the case of Mrs Shirley Shackleton's resistance to arrest in 1998 that she was within her legal rights to resist arrest. Back in 1997 a Save Albert Park protester was arrested for setting off a smoke distress flare on the day of the race because the offender did not first obtain permission of the local authority. Again, the magistrate found that there were no restrictions on the use of the flare and permission was not required. My question is: would the defence forces even hesitate in such a circumstance to use violence to stop someone letting off flares? Could they argue that serious injury might actually be the result? It must be remembered that at the time the state government was deploying a huge number of its police force in defending those who were damaging the park. Permission of the states, as I understand it, is not a prerequisite for Defence Force intervention, but I can imagine that the Kennett government at the time would have been quite happy to have had the troops there who would not have to worry about charges and not have to concern themselves with reasonable, non-violent treatment of protesters. </para><para>On the question of damage to property being a reason for calling in the troops—the amendment the government has put up with the support of the ALP—the Albert Park protest would also meet the requirement. The minister has said that property would have to be substantial infrastructure. I am sure it would be quite easy to demonstrate that the road itself and the numerous other structures would be substantial, indeed of international significance. In fact damage to property is what the state government has wrought on the park and therefore the public, however. It could be argued that tying yellow ribbons to these structures constituted damage. Stopping the work of bulldozers could be interpreted as doing damage to property, in that it prevented, in the short term at least, the construction of some important part of the road or the pits.</para><para>The protests at Albert Park have been peaceful—at least on the part of the protesters—and as far as I am aware no deliberate damage was done to property. However, it is not difficult for those who want to see protesters out of the way for set-ups to be organised. This has happened in forest protests, where loggers have spiked trees themselves and then blamed the protesters. At Albert Park, tacks were thrown on the road before a cycling event and Save Albert Park were blamed, even though there was absolutely no evidence to connect members to the incident. In fact, this mindless action has been repeated on other roads elsewhere. So it is quite easy to stitch up a protest group by doing the damage yourself and then putting the blame on whichever group you want to get rid of.</para><para>Again, in my home state of Victoria, charges have been laid against residents and conservationists in so many forest protests and thrown out by magistrate's courts. In 1998 the Geelong Magistrate's Court found that logging authorised by the Department of Natural Resources and Environment was unlawful. In 1997, 11 people were arrested on the Wild Dog Ridge Track because protesters were obstructing logging contractors' clear-fell logging. This is a ridge just north of Apollo Bay that is a popular place for local bushwalking. The magistrate found that the department had illegally authorised the extension of a clear-fell logging coupe into the water supply reserve which supplies Colac with domestic water and is recognised in the Otways Forest Management Plan as a flora and fauna reserve. It is often the case that forestry departments and loggers are extremely gung-ho, and they regard the protesters as an irritation and feel they can do pretty well anything they want to remove them. A protester in 1998 was bashed about the head with an axe handle and made unconscious. He needed five stitches. Would this be enough to bring in the defence forces, and who would they be targeting if they came? </para><para>Earlier this year, protesters in the Otways were attacked by loggers and six were hospitalised. The police did not come for five hours and, when they did, charges were not laid. Apart from the vicious attacks by loggers on protesters, it could reasonably be argued that there was a likelihood of death or serious injury, because the most effective form of protest now in forests is for the protesters to climb into the treetops to prevent them from being chopped down. Sometimes they even camp in the treetops for extended periods. We need to remember that these brave people do this with the support of the vast majority of Victorians who think it is time to end logging in our native forests, particularly in the Otways where little remains of what was once a very large forest. The loggers are not game to cut those trees down when protesters are perched up high, and neither will the police, but what response would the defence forces make in such a situation? A six-month delay might allow us to have those questions answered. It is my understanding of the bill that there are no safeguards against wrongful accusations. There are no rights of appeal against unilateral action taken by the troops. This is a sad day for the right to take part in a peaceful protest, and it is yet another deterrent to ordinary people taking this kind of action when all else seems to have failed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>17612</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be very brief. I assume that the debate on Senator Harris's motion will take place in the debate on the third reading of the bill. I see nodding around the place, very vigorous in some parts. Senator Harris has made a very strong case. He has done this with his amendments that have been put forward to the chamber. I have voted for a number of those amendments—certainly not all—for those that have been put forward by the Democrats through Senator Bourne, Senator Murray and Senator Greig, and for some of Senator Brown's amendments. Some of those attracted my vote, and I am very disappointed that they are not in the bill that we are now faced with voting on for the third reading. I think the whole legislation in this area is diminished by the fact that some of those were not accepted. However, obviously the debate and the convictions of other senators around the place have led to some other amendments which have been quite worth while and have improved the legislation somewhat.</para></talk.start><para>I am in a difficult situation at present. If the Senate votes for the amendment moved by Senator Harris, the legislation will have no effect until six months time. I am a bit worried about that, because there are a couple of events coming up which obviously may trigger the provisions of the legislation. I have thought about this quite a bit. I have to say—and in advance I apologise to some of my colleagues—that it is better to have legislation than no legislation. It is better to have the legislation that is now before us to decide upon than none at all because of the clear legislative protection it would give to not only those persons who are demonstrating but also the defence forces. Under those circumstances, I will be reluctantly voting for the carriage of the third reading.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17613</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It has been a long debate, and I want to add a word of congratulations to Senator Bourne and Senator Harris for the contributions they have made trying to ensure that the <inline ref="R1122">Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000</inline> was in the interests of Australians as a whole. The legislation fails to do that. It set out to deal with the projected problem of terrorism at the Olympics. It had two options: one was to deal with that situation; the other was to come in with a much more far reaching piece of legislation that would cover all eventualities into the future which the imagination of the current government could foresee might attract the use of Australian troops against Australian citizens. Unfortunately, they took the latter option. Even more unfortunately, the opposition has backed them up all the way down the line.  </para></talk.start><para>This should have been a bill against terrorism, and I think it would then have had universal support. But the terror of this bill itself is that it is wide open to abuse in the sending of troops in against Australian protesters or Australian strikers. We have to remember that during the debate on this legislation the Labor Party and the government got together, first of all, to vote down a sunset clause. That made it very clear that this bill was not just for the Olympics; it was for unspecified situations into the future. Indeed, Senator Ellison said as much, that this was to cover all eventualities—that is, all political possibilities as far as future governments might see themselves being advantaged by the Army being brought in.</para><para>Next the opposition combined with the government to vote down the really important caveat that a state or territory had to agree before the troops were brought into that state's domain. In particular, they voted down the necessity for the state government or the state police force involved to give permission before troops were used. That has removed the time honoured convention at least, flowing from the Constitution and the Defence Act of 1903, that the states would be consulted in a way which was very meaningful, which in fact gave permission to the use of troops. That is all on the side now, and in fact there has to be no consultation whatever if the situation is deemed to be urgent enough. </para><para>There ought to have been in this legislation a real restriction on the use of troops against protesters and strikers. But, once again, the opposition combined with the government to vote that down. In fact, for a fragile few hours the opposition said, `Well, we'll allow the troops to be used against strikers but only if there is a real likelihood, in the mind of the commander of the troops who has been sent out, of serious injury or death if that did not happen.' But they then caved into the government's added proviso that the troops could be sent into action against Australian civilians if property was at stake. There is the heart of the thrust of this legislation. Terrorists are very often motivated by some sort of political short-term gain, not property. That very important proviso on property put in the bill by Labor and Liberal says much more about the world we are in today. It says much more about the coming together of the big parties to defend property and the moneyed and powerful interests that there are around the world who more and more want to rule the world without a democratic halter. </para><para>The protests at the World Economic Forum in the coming week are because people feel disempowered. Those Australians who one way or another have had a glimmer of the debate in this parliament on this legislation have every right to feel disempowered. The legislation went through the House of Representatives, supported by both the big parties, without an amendment being flagged. And it has gone through the Senate with some very puny amendments, which come from the tour de force that the crossbench parties have put up in opposition to the use of troops against Australian civilians. But the Labor Party has strikingly shown that at the end of the day it is interested in protecting the property of the already powerful rather than protecting the democratic rights of the average citizens.</para><para>It is an interesting balance that has emerged in this chamber. On the one hand, we have the three big parties—the coalition parties and the opposition—defending the interests of property against the rights of citizens; on the other hand, we have a diversity of small parties growing in strength in a democracy—a phenomenon that is going to be emphasised—standing from their diverse points of view in the interests of the citizens and putting that, not property, first. Nevertheless, Labor has backed the government on that key amendment which said that troops can be called out in defence of property at some future time. </para><para>The other thing that the opposition and government got together to do was to put the executive before democracy, to put the executive before the parliament. The big parties decided that, when it came to the recall of parliament, it would be limited. Under division 2—that is, where the troops are sent into a whole range of situations, short of martial law—there is no recall at all. If martial law is declared under division 3, then there is a recall after six days, but it does not have anywhere near the definition that the Democrats' amendment would have given it.</para><para>We have to note that the government during this debate, without any pressure from the opposition, withheld from the committee advice that it had on the constitutionality of this whole process. It withheld the handbook, that is, the codification of troops action, which will be in place next week and which ought to have been part of the debate on this legislation. And, of course, it withheld any information, as did the opposition, about who, in recent times, the principal lobby has been to have this legislation designed and put through as it is. None of that information was brought before the committee.</para><para>Four centuries ago, there was a major constitutional crisis in Britain, from whom we have inherited common law. The `Petition of the Right', which means `the correct', of course, was brought before Charles I, who was compelled to accept that petition in 1627, which complained:</para><quote><para>... great companies of souldiers and marriners have been dispersed into divers counties of the realme ... against the lawes and customes of this realme and to the great greivance and vexacion of the people.</para></quote><para>The petition demanded:</para><quote><para>... that your Majestie would be pleased to remove the said souldiers and mariners and that your people may not be soe burthened in tyme to come.</para></quote><para>It then went on to demand:</para><quote><para>... that commissions for martial law should be `revoked and annulled', and that `hereafter no commissions of like nature may issue forth to any person or persons whatsoever.'</para></quote><para>Four centuries down the line, we now have a bill which allows their majesties of the future—three ministers in this place—to declare martial law, and, short of that, to send in the troops without declaring martial law and without reporting to parliament. That is what this legislation does. Right from the outset, the politicians involved in designing this legislation have failed this nation. Right from the outset, there should have been two pieces of legislation: one for terrorists and one to deal with civil protests. But right from the outset to now, the government and the opposition have agreed to allow the two to be intertwined and undifferentiated. I cannot, and never would, stand for that. The Greens could not support that and, quite clearly, nor could the Democrats or One Nation. What is it with the Labor Party that it has decided to defend property ahead of the rights of citizens, to have troops available to put down strikes in this country and to have troops available at the disposal of not the parliament nor the government but three members of the executive to send in against Australian citizens in the future?</para><para>There was no difficulty in separating the two matters: terrorism on the one side and public dissent on the other. But in this legislation the Labor Party, along with the government, has deliberately classed acts of civil disobedience in this country as no different from terrorism. There is nowhere in this bill that differentiates them—nowhere. That is what is wrong with it. The Labor Party should be ashamed of itself. The government should be ashamed of itself. This legislation is not in the interests of the average Australian. It may be in the interests of a few big corporations, but it is not in the interests of 19 million Australians. It is a very sad day in this country for democracy, and particularly parliamentary democracy, that this legislation, which drains power away from the parliament and the people and puts it into the hands of the executive and those who have property, should be passed here, as it will. </para><para>I want to again congratulate Senator Bourne for the way in which she has so strongly been a public advocate in this situation and has shown a sensitivity for the rights of Australians, and a fear for the situations which can be the outcome of this legislation. I also want to congratulate Senator Harris. This has been the most formidable input he has had into parliamentary debate since he came here.

I congratulate Senator Harris on moving this amendment to the third reading of the bill, and we will certainly be supporting it. Let us get clear what we have here. If this bill is passed into law and is found to be constitutional, it will mean that Australian troops can be directed, as a lawful order, to shoot dead other Australians under some circumstances. It would be a perfectly lawful order, if this bill is found to be constitutional. There is no opportunity, and there will be no opportunity, for conscientious objection. I cannot believe the Labor Party voted against conscientious objection, but they did.</para></talk.start><para>I hope there is never, ever an occasion upon which this bill is used. But, when I think of the enthusiasm that the workplace relations minister brought to his actions in relation to the waterfront, I fear that this bill may be used. I think that will be a very, very dark day for Australia. If it is used against terrorism, that is fine; and if this had just been about terrorism that would have been fine—but it is not. It is about industrial disputes. It is about protesters. It is now about conscientious objection to shooting other Australians. It is about a lot of things. It is not just about terrorism.</para><para>I am glad you are proud of yourselves up there—I am not. I am not proud of this chamber. I am not proud of what has been going on over the last week. I just find it really very sad. Everyone agrees that we need rules that will codify what the Defence Force can do when it is called in to aid the civil power, but this is not the bill for it. This bill was done in haste, obviously. We found an awful lot of problems with it, and they have been fixed—some of them. The government has had amendments, the opposition has had amendments, and all of those have, I think, been passed. In fact, I agreed with some of them—a lot of them. But Senator Brown had an awful lot of very good amendments. They were excellent amendments. They would have improved the bill no end. Senator Harris had an awful lot of very good amendments that would have improved the bill. In fact, I had a lot of amendments that would have improved the bill. But you would not even listen to them. You were not interested.</para><para>The reason you would not listen and you were not interested was that they were our amendments. That is just such a terrible way to run a country. It is a terrible way to run a country. We might not be as big as you—well, we are not as big as you—but we were still elected, and by an awful lot of people. Senator Faulkner knows, because he is from New South Wales, that you have to get a hell of a lot of votes to get elected in New South Wales. So there are an awful lot of people that we are representing around Australia, and they were not listened to. In fact, I think an awful lot of people that the ALP represents around Australia were not listened to. I find that really very sad—very, very sad. </para><para>As I said, this is not the bill that it should be. I certainly will not be voting for it and I do not know any Democrats who will be voting for it. I can also understand that there are probably a lot of members of the Labor Party—maybe none of those sitting in the chamber at the moment—who will be very unhappy about voting on that side on the third reading. I should say to them that over the last couple of days I have been sending out membership forms to members of the Labor Party—not members from this chamber, but just ordinary old members of the Labor Party. So, if anybody feels like coming around for a plunger coffee or a cup of tea—I know Senator Faulkner does not drink coffee, so we have got herbal tea in the cupboard too—feel free to pop around!</para><para>But, not to take it flippantly, I think this is really a very sad day. This is a very sad day for Australia. I will most certainly be well and truly voting against this bill, because I do not think that it does anything to enhance the rights of Australians. I think it takes away, in many cases, the rights of Australians—really very basic rights. More than anything, when a bill such as this is passed, it ought to be passed with the agreement of a majority of Australians—and this will not be. This does not have the Australian people with it. That is a very sad thing, too. It might have the two major parties, but it does not have the people they represent, and I think that is extremely sad as well. So it is a sad day for Australia, and I think and fear it is going to happen. But certainly we will be testing it and we will be calling a division, and I will most certainly be voting for Senator Harris's excellent amendment and voting against the third reading of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>17616</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have made it very clear throughout this debate—and it has been a very long committee stage debate and, of course, it was a substantial second reading debate as well—to this chamber that the opposition believes that the Commonwealth should not be given any greater powers to use the ADF in domestic security matters than the Constitution currently allows for. In fact, we have made it very clear that we believe the current situation is unsatisfactory and that that situation ought to be addressed.</para></talk.start><para>You see, as we speak, there is no appropriate or effective legislative framework to define or restrict the Commonwealth's powers and actions in using the Australian defence forces in a domestic security situation. And there is no protection of civil liberties, if and when the Commonwealth does decide to use these powers—no procedures, no restrictions, no processes, no guidelines that are stipulated by legislation that the Commonwealth must adhere to if it were to call out the troops. That is the problem that the parliament faces. That is the problem that the Labor Party has tried to address during debate on this bill.</para><para>So we have come to this debate with an open mind. We have come to this debate to try and improve the existing situation; that has guided our approach. What will occur if this bill passes both houses of the Australian parliament is that, for the first time since Federation, we will have in place substantial safeguards and constraints on the use of the Australian defence forces in circumstances of grave civil emergency. Of course, as I have said, currently those restraints do not exist. Frankly, if there are any constraints at all—one or two senators have tried to mount those arguments but have not done so effectively—they are hopelessly inadequate and they offer no real protection. So that is the situation that the opposition looked to address.</para><para>Of course, the government has had problems in passing this bill, and those problems have been of the government's own making. I agree: this bill should have been introduced many months ago—many, many months ago—so that we could have had a full and proper public debate as well as the sort of lengthy parliamentary debate that we have certainly had in this chamber. So what did the opposition do in this circumstance? We tried to remedy that unsatisfactory situation. We tried to ensure proper review and scrutiny on this issue. It was the opposition who first raised concerns over this bill and referred the bill to a Senate inquiry. I note that neither the Australian Democrats nor the Australian Greens bothered to attend the Senate inquiry into this important legislation—neither did Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party attend the Senate inquiry or participate in its work at all. It was Labor's initiative, and Labor's work on that committee was very important in improving this bill. It was Labor's work on the Senate committee that kick-started the public debate on this important legislation. </para><para>It has been Labor all along who has argued to protect civil liberties and responded to the concerns of the broader community—and I agree that they are real concerns—to make sure that this legislation does achieve what it sets out to achieve—that is, to put into legislation clear procedures, clear processes and real restrictions on government in the use of its constitutional powers, and also accountability measures to govern the use of the ADF in domestic security situations. None of those have existed before—none of them.</para><para>There are no new Commonwealth powers here, but there are now restrictions—if this bill passes—on how those powers may be applied. Let us see what has been achieved through the parliamentary process since the government introduced its bill. Through the Senate committee process—particularly due to the work of Senator Hogg, whom I would like to acknowledge in this third reading debate for his outstanding efforts on the Senate committee—we achieved a number of improvements, such as ensuring that there is an obligation on the Commonwealth to notify the state or territory where the call-out is to occur. Also, we were able to extend the proviso that the reserve and emergency forces of the ADF be prohibited from being used in connection with an industrial dispute. We were also able to prevent the delegation of powers under the legislation to a minister other than the authorising ministers. And we were able to ensure approved accountability to this parliament.</para><para>In the lengthy committee stage debate that we have had in this chamber on this bill, the opposition has successfully moved a number of additional important amendments—and I thank the Greens, the Democrats and other senators who have supported those opposition amendments. Those amendments were successfully moved to the government's bill, the most important of which will prevent troops from being used to stop or restrict peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action.</para><para>It is worth remembering what those amendments are. Firstly, that the Commonwealth must consult with the relevant state or territory government before it undertakes any action under this legislation. Secondly, that the parliament must be immediately notified of the use of the Defence Force during a call-out for general security purposes. Thirdly, that the parliament must, if it is not already sitting, be reconvened no more than six days after a call-out for general security purposes to provide the parliament with an opportunity to consider and address the circumstances that have led to the call-out. Fourthly, that it be a statutory requirement that this legislation must be reviewed either within six months of the use of the call-out power or within three years of its enactment. And, fifthly, that the Defence Force will never be used against any peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. That has been achieved in the committee stage debate, as well as those initiatives driven by Labor through the Senate committee process.</para><para>The amendment that deals with peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or industrial disputes does place the tightest possible restrictions on the Commonwealth in using its constitutional powers to call out and use its troops in domestic security situations. Now we say that the government's first attempt to constrain the use of Defence Force personnel was totally inadequate. The bill would only have prevented Defence Force personnel from being deployed to stop or restrict lawful protest or dissent. As the opposition pointed out, this would have allowed troops to be deployed in circumstances of non-violent or peaceful protest provided there was some technical illegality. Labor's amendment is squarely directed at ensuring troops are never used—I repeat that: never used—to restrict protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. That is what we set out to achieve, and I am pleased that we have been able to improve the bill in that regard. </para><para>I have heard a lot during this very long committee stage debate from a number of senators, and on this occasion particularly Senator Brown and Senator Harris who appear to be in strong agreement on this issue. We have heard all sorts of scenarios that could possibly occur under this legislation. Well, I took all those issues seriously. I make this point: whatever scenario has been raised in this chamber, each and every one of them could apply under the current situation, the existing arrangements, where there are no constraints at all. The status quo that we are dealing with at the moment is a situation where there is no protection of civil liberties—none.  </para><para>So the irony here is that those opposing the legislation seem to accept that we have a totally unsatisfactory situation under which their worst nightmares can come true. We acknowledge the current situation is unsatisfactory, we acknowledge there are no constraints, we acknowledge there are imperfections, and we want to improve it. That is the spirit with which we have come to debate this legislation in the parliament, and that is the spirit with which we have moved many amendments. We have argued the case very strongly through the committee stage debate and we have massively improved this bill.</para><para>Let us look at what the situation is as a result of this legislation and what conditions apply for the troops to be called out in a domestic security crisis—that is, the situation that will apply if the third reading of this bill passes this chamber and then the House of Representatives. What you have to do is to compare that situation with the Commonwealth's current unfettered constitutional powers. This is the story: not only domestic violence but violence of a kind that poses a threat to the capacity of the relevant state or territory to protect either itself or the Commonwealth must exist. Then either a request for a call-out by the relevant state or territory government or consultation between the Commonwealth and that state or territory must occur. That must be met. </para><para>The Governor-General must be satisfied, on the unanimous advice of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence, that those conditions have been met. Then, once a call-out has occurred, the Chief of the Defence Force must utilise the Defence Force in a manner that is reasonable and necessary. The Chief of the Defence Force must ensure that, as far as is reasonably practicable, the Defence Force cooperates with the relevant state and territory police force and is not used for any particular task, unless a member of the police force requests in writing that the Defence Force be so used. And in exercising powers relevant to serious damage to property, the authorising ministers must declare a general security area and publicise that fact. Again and again in this debate, we have pointed out that no restrictions currently apply to the use of the Defence Force if it is called out. </para><para>Compare the improved situation under this bill with the current unfettered constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. It is because this bill puts in place some of those safeguards for the very first time that we support the passage of this legislation. We do not do it lightly. The Commonwealth should have legislation in place that outlines proper processes, procedures and restrictions on how, when and why it can use the most serious of its constitutional powers. </para><para>The opposition believe that these inadequacies should be corrected now rather than have a situation occur that highlights the failings of the current framework—in a very practical sense—and forces changes after the event. The absence of strong and effective procedures and processes applying to the use of ADF personnel for internal security matters is the reason the Labor Party believe this bill is warranted. It is not a question in relation just to the Olympics; it is a situation we believe applies more permanently. But much of the concern raised about this legislation results from people not really understanding what the current situation is or what the Senate and the parliament have been grappling with and the fact that there are no restrictions on how the Commonwealth can use its powers. Another very important point is that this is not the end of the debate on this matter; it is not the end of the debate on the use of the Defence Force in situations of grave civil emergency.

Firstly, Senator Faulkner has outlined the absolute deficiency of the current situation relating to any call-outs by the Commonwealth, which the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee recognised in its report. It is not only timely but obligatory for the government to fix this situation. This bill does remedy the situation, and it does have checks and balances in it which serve the Australian people. This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 28 June this year, and no less than two Senate committees have looked at it: the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—of which you are a member, Mr Acting Deputy President, and an active member in relation to this inquiry—and the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. As well as that, there has been a protracted debate on this bill in this very chamber, and there has also been public debate.</para></talk.start><para>The government would say that, over the last two months, the attention that has been given to this bill is way above the normal attention given to legislation. And so it should have been; the call-out of the ADF in aid of civilian authorities is a very serious matter, and the government has taken it very seriously. Because of that the government took on board the recommendations made by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee and adopted those recommendations in government amendments. It was also because of that that the government took seriously the proposals put to it by the opposition and supported opposition amendments. The government would say that this showed the serious regard in which it held this bill and that the attention it gave to it was very necessary. The response by the government has indicated that in the adoption both of opposition amendments and of the recommendations of the committee. I want to place on record that the government has not been cavalier about this at all. Over the last two months intense interest, scrutiny and attention have been given to this bill and there has been a lengthy debate in this chamber. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hogg)</inline>—Senator Harris, the debate has been terminated by the minister in reply.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator Harris</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

It has been identified as a matter of importance for not only political parties in Australia but also governments across the globe. I have canvassed this before in the chamber in relation to how we deal with rapid changes in technology and how they are utilised by members of the community. It has received more attention with some recent publicity, not the least of which was last week's <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> article by Fred Brenchley entitled `Casting the Internet'.</para></talk.start><para>So the words `digital divide' refer to the gap between those who have the access, knowledge and equipment to utilise new information based technologies and those who do not. It is an acknowledgment that equity in that regard is not exactly automatic. In fact NOIE, the National Office for the Information Economy, defines a `digital divide' as:</para><quote><para>... the social implications of unequal access of some sectors of the community to information and communications technology and to the acquisition of necessary skills.</para></quote><para>This presents us, as governments and parliamentarians, with the challenge of ensuring that members of the community do have the capacity to use information technology developments to their advantage in their day-to-day lives. The issues that are mostly bound up in this are about access and education. Access involves obvious matters like the hardware—computers and modems—that enables the usage of information technology, and then on to software. It also involves the provision of the infrastructure necessary to utilise that equipment—for example, simple access to phone lines of a certain capacity. The issue of education, though, is a little less straightforward to quantify and qualify. It includes things like the knowledge of how to actually use a computer and the Internet or email; the capacity to in fact read and write in the language being used—the challenges of literacy; and knowing how to use the technology for the tasks that you need or that you want to undertake. </para><para>The divide can exist at two levels: at a country level, for example, where less developed nations might fall to one side of the divide and more advanced nations to the other, and at a local level where, within communities, different sectors of those communities have varying capacities to both use and access IT. A casual observance of US elections will indicate the importance being placed on IT, and the digital divide that exists in the current US election campaign. I have talked about some of the IT issues involved in presidential and general election campaigns before. But it is obviously not just about IT as a tool for campaigning. This is also an area which has drawn the attention of all the major political parties in the United States. For example, George W Bush and the Republicans have focused on issues of education, looking at the differences in access to IT among schools, using IT as a means of communication between citizens and government, and the challenge of ensuring that people with disabilities, most particularly, can use technology to their advantage.</para><para>The Democrats have had the opportunity to do some work in this area through their current administration. I suspect they still have some way to go. Some of the mechanisms they have put in place, for example, include their recently announced $12.5 million E-Corps program to be run by the Corporation for National Service to recruit mem-bers for projects aimed at bringing digital opportunity to youth, families and communities. Their digital divide web site provides information on the government's efforts through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</para><para>This is also an issue that must go beyond the concern of government. Later this year in Seattle there is an international conference on `Creating digital dividends—applying technology for sustainable development'. It is going to look at issues that surround the expansion of new technologies into regions, industries and applications where they are most needed. The conference has a huge range of speakers, ranging from Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon.com; to Mark Malloch Brown, the administrator of UNDP; to Bill Gates himself. The conference is a recognition that a gap exists globally between those who have access to new technologies and those who do not. There are some very interesting statistics about this in the conference material. For example, there are more telephones in New York City than in all of rural Asia and there are more Internet accounts in London than in all of Africa. The conference indicates obviously that this is a digital divide beyond the United States.</para><para>This is a challenge which is being recognised elsewhere, with steps being undertaken to address those challenges. For example, even the government in Pakistan recently announced a policy to address their digital future; their democratic future, I am not so sure about. Part of that involves providing Internet access at the cost of a local call to 100 cities across the country. In Somalia, of all places, the first ISP recently started operation. They also became the last remaining African country to provide local dial-up access to the Net.</para><para>Turning to perhaps what might be described as the more developed nations, on 28 August the <inline font-style="italic">Washington Post</inline> ran an article about the digital divide in parts of Latin America. They refer to the issue as digital apartheid, meaning that the average Internet user in Latin America is still white, male, urban, university educated and rich or upper middle class. The article cited a highly interesting example of a remote village in Peru where grants from a Lima based NGO, the Canadian government and a telephone company provided equipment and training for the village. This has enabled access to video streaming for education, and the village has now established a web site in Spanish at www.rcp.net.pe/ashaninkal—the name of the village—with information about their folklore. They even have what is described in the article as a tribal cyber cafe. They have used the equipment to sell produce—organic oranges, in fact—to other parts of the country.</para><para>The establishment of that site in the Spanish language raises a whole other issue about the language of the Internet. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, for example, reported this week that the take-up of the Internet in Japan is so rapid that at current rates it will be more connected than the United States within two years. It is not too difficult to find the answer to the question: in what language will these new users want to log on? It will not be English. The OECD figures, though, currently indicate that less than three per cent of the Net uses the Japanese language, with Spanish language use at less than two per cent. This compares with a dominating 78 per cent in English, but that will obviously change.</para><para>That presents an enormous challenge for a nation like ours, which has a strong dominance in one language. Even with our multicultural background, our language base is very low. We run the risk of losing out on access to information and interchange if we do not remedy that. I read an article recently about shifts in language use on the Net—perhaps I should be saying this en francais given the current debate about language and the Olympics—but the shifts to Hindi, Mandarin and Portuguese, in terms of volume on the Net, are going to present dominantly English speaking nations like ours with enormous problems. </para><para>The ABS recently released statistics on the use of the Net in Australian households, and I have spoken about this before. Our trends are similar to other developed nations: 54 per cent of households have a computer and 33 per cent of households have access to the Net. Those are improving figures but still gender, income and geography all impact on the capacity of people to access the Net. We really have to address this; we cannot afford to allow those on one side of the digital divide to lose an opportunity to achieve a place in Australia's growing information based economy. This is not just a new communications tool. It is not like a fax, phone or telex—if anybody remembers those. This is about information and education, without which it is very hard to win the battle. </para><para>So the divide in Australia is not a simple issue. It will not simply be solved through individuals and families paying to go online. It is not only about cost in terms of paying but also about capacity to pay both literally and figuratively—in some parts of Australia, if you are young woman, if you do not speak English, if you live in a smaller rural town, if you do not even know how to use a computer. Money is, therefore, not the only barrier to accessing new technologies.</para><para>The government has taken up some of these challenges. Programs like Networking the Nation, and the efforts of NOIE and the Office of Government Online are good examples. One program which DETYA operates is the Computers for Schools initiative, where surplus computers and equipment from Commonwealth and state governments are donated to schools. In my own area equipment has been donated to St Gregory's Armenian School, which I am sure was very welcome.</para><para>I launched the international computer drivers licence scheme with NOIE in Mount Druitt just recently—in New South Wales through the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE—to enable women to return to the work force with IT skills. I know that, for example, John Paul College in Queensland is also pursuing the international computer drivers licence through their efforts with new technology. They have provided at enormous expense all students and teachers with laptop computers to do this. Just this week Nelson Mandela said:</para><quote><para>Persons of my age and background can but listen in awe and only with a faint sense of understanding to descriptions of how advances in technology will reshape our world and the way we live.</para></quote><para>That demonstrates that the divide is about not just how to access information but how to most effectively use it. It is important that all aspects of government—federal, state and local—are part of enabling access to information through new technology. As members of parliament we have an even more important obligation in that regard. The Commonwealth has achieved a great deal. Even Tony Harris commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 22 August about that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forest Industry</title><page.no>17623</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17623</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to speak about an industry that I have had a long association with, an industry that I think over the years has received a significant degree of political interference. Some of that has been good and some of it has been downright bad. We have a coalition government in place at the moment, whose Minister for Forestry and Conservation is Mr Wilson Tuckey. He has developed what he calls an action agenda to pursue the vision for Australia's forests and wood products industry of maximising sustainable and profitable activity for tree growing, value adding and marketing of Australia's forest and wood products. In terms of looking at impediments and opportunities in the industry he goes to a number of questions that deal with credibility of forest operations and products, and he says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>There is a growing demand for assurances that timber and fibre products are:</para><para>sourced from sustainably managed forests; and</para><para>fit-for-purpose in accordance with defined technical standards.</para></quote><para>In particular I want to deal with the first part of that, because that is true: there is a growing demand for wood products that are sourced from sustainably managed forests. However, in this country that is simply not the case. There is no forest, I would suggest, at this point in time that is being sustainably managed. I say that against my past background of a long involvement with this industry, as a secretary of the former Timber Workers Union, and now as the president of the CFMEU forest division in Tasmania. I say that because if you read the ABARE statistics in terms of forestry you can actually see that. You can see: one, we are not sustainably managing the forests; and, two, we are not managing the forests for the purposes of good downstream processing and maximising of the products that we take out of the forest in terms of downstream processing. I would like to just make a couple of points about that. I quote from a report, which says at page 24: </para><quote><para>In the early 1990s, woodchip exports accounted for 56 per cent of the total value forest products exports. In 1998-99 the value of woodchip exports fell to 45 per cent of the total forest product exports and in the first three quarters of 1999-2000 had fallen to 41 per cent.</para></quote><para>Just taking those figures you would think that is a good thing. But then if we look at the log exports—that is wood exported in log form—the report says:</para><quote><para>Log exports at 789 000 cubic metres so far in 1999-2000 were 44 per cent higher than in the same period in 1998-1999.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—What's gone wrong?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—I take an interjection from the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

I said `any government'—both state and Commonwealth. I have made these points before. But I particularly want to deal with the role of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has over a long period of time had the opportunity to really put in place an appropriate strategy for this industry. It has not. And this proposal by the minister, Mr Tuckey, is not going to achieve that. If you read the entire proposal you could be forgiven for thinking that you were reading something that was developed 10 years ago. That is a major problem. Unfortunately, a lot of commodity industries often need good government direction and that is what is not happening in the case of this industry. Not only is this not happening in the area of downstream processing and better utilisation of the products that we take out of the forests, particularly native forests, but it is also not happening in the area of plantations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I happened to notice a letter from the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> in a full-page ad—paid for, I think, by four particular plantation companies. Mr Tuckey claims that the plantation industry is a good industry—I would agree with that—that it is well-managed and that it is structurally sound, both from the point of view of the economic interests of this country and from the point of view of financial investment. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality for Australia's plantation industry is this: planting is being done at a rate that may be acceptable and may be necessary, but it is being done in such an ad hoc way, with no cohesion and no strategic planning, that it will be a total disaster at the end of the day. For the many thousands of people who are putting their money into these mass market plantation investment schemes it will be a disaster financially, save for the fact that forest plantations, not unlike most other agribusiness mass market investment schemes, are essentially tax driven. What is happening is that essentially the taxpayers of Australia are funding these things. Some individuals who are investing in these schemes do so specifically to reduce their income to allow them to gain benefits—such as access to Austudy and other social security benefits such as family assistance—that they would not otherwise gain. There has been an uncovering of certain arrangements that clearly are tax evasion, and the tax office has jumped on a lot of those. But that really is just the tip of the iceberg, because there are so many problems associated with this that the taxation problems will not become evident for some time.</para><para>Another aspect of this which is critical in terms of good planning for a good forest industry in this country is that you must take account of the global situation; you must take account of what other countries in the world are doing when you are planting whatever you might want to plant for the global market. We must remember, and the figures in ABARE will tell you, that essentially the wood we are growing will be for the export market—for nothing else. And yet, if you were to ask companies in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania if they have any understanding of what the others are doing about the timing of plantings and the maturation of the crops that they are planting, most of them would say no. They would say it is a competitive market. I have to say that, when you look at the number of trees being planted, particularly some species, and when you look at the projections stated in the prospectuses that are hawked around to various investors, you have to say they are totally outrageous. This minister and this government have a responsibility to address these questions. In closing, I would suggest to the minister that it does him no credit to line up with certain companies without first checking the facts. He has an obligation, and I hope at some point in time this government will take it up. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Managed Investments Schemes</title><page.no>17625</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>17625</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take the opportunity this evening to raise concerns that I have in relation to the regime that governs managed investments schemes. That new regime was established by the Managed Investments Act 1998. Back in 1998, during the debate on the Management Investments Bill, this government spoke of the bill in glowing terms, claiming that it would, among other things, improve investor protection. Senators will recall that a major thrust of the reforms was to change the structure of managed investments schemes from one comprising two tiers to one comprising a single responsible entity. Those two tiers were a management company responsible for the day-to-day operations and investment strategy of the scheme and a trustee which distributed scheme income and ensured investments conformed to the trust deed. The new system was only a single entity, responsible for the entirety of the scheme operation. The weakness of this new system was self-evident. Regulatory oversight by trustees and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, was to be replaced by oversight by ASIC alone; a clear diminution of protection.</para></talk.start><para>The loss of a trustee role was supposed to be justified by great cost savings. I always thought those projections optimistic at best and distinctly rubbery at worst. And, on a cost-benefit basis, the benefit of lower costs could be swamped by the cost of investor losses through more schemes collapsing. I and others sounded a warning that eliminating the independent trustee's role would erode investor protection, particularly if the new regulatory and policing regime had insufficient funding, commitment and teeth to protect investors from questionable schemes. Labor and the coalition ignored those warnings. The then Victorian Attorney-General, Jan Wade, in a submission to an inquiry into the Managed Investments Bill, commented:</para><quote><para>There can be no doubt that under the proposed regime there will be greater likelihood of loss to investors and less likelihood that they will recover their losses.</para></quote><para>And, remember, we are talking about more and more ordinary Australians, including mum and dad investors, using managed funds to invest their hard-earned life savings and retirement funds.</para><para>As I have said, the new managed investments regime abolished the role of the independent trustee. Scheme management was placed in the hands of the so-called responsible entity, and ASIC was given responsibility for regulating managed schemes. While ASIC cannot be expected to foresee every scheme that may get into trouble, it does have a minimum responsibility to ensure that schemes comply with the letter and the spirit of the new regulatory regime and to keep a watching brief.</para><para>This regime requires brokers to produce for each investment a prospectus to be registered with ASIC. The loans are to be approved by the responsible entity, which can opt to have an independent custodian check that all is as it should be. While an external body is not required in all cases, the criteria mean that an independent custodian should be used in most cases. So what has happened since? In 1998 there was the Wattle Group affair in which many self-funded retirees, including ex-policepersons, lost their lifesavings or superannuation. During the public debate that followed, the new managed investment regime was accused of falling down on the job in terms of protecting investors. However, trustee systems were still nominally in place due to the transitional arrangements, so that may not be entirely accurate.</para><para>More recently, problems have arisen in some managed investment schemes in my home state of Western Australia. These have resulted in a limited judicial inquiry and all the media coverage and public anguish that ordinary investors rightly generate. A number of people have been charged. In just one recent case that received media coverage, a group of investors faces the very real risk of losing money invested through Nedlands finance broker Clifton Partners Finance. The funds were lent to a developer for a property development that was not completed, and the unfinished development was not of a value to cover the loans. </para><para>In 1998 the Democrats advocated stronger capital adequacy provisions which could have assisted those Western Australian investors, but this scheme has collapsed with insufficient funds backing the property development. I also would have thought that this Western Australian scheme fitted the criteria for requiring an independent custodian, but an independent custodian was not used in this scheme. If it had been, investors' funds would have been better protected. I ask the government and ASIC how this scheme slipped through the net and was able to avoid using an independent custodian. At the very least, ASIC should presumably have thoroughly checked that all was well with the scheme's prospectus. Had it done so, investors could have been forewarned of a prospectus containing anomalies, inconsistencies, misstatements or oversights—warning bells that something is wrong. Investors were led to believe that the new regime would protect them but clearly it did not. No regime will ever completely protect investors, but our point was that the old regime had much greater safeguards. Two years ago I warned of the risks of totally eliminating the independent trustee's role. In the recent Western Australian case, only some of the investment moneys may be recovered. I raise this Western Australian example not in an `I told you so' spirit, but so that the government will recognise that its new regime is inadequate from an investor protection perspective. If the new regime is not strengthened, we may face a repetition of the shonky schemes which flourished in the seventies and eighties and which are now being exposed in Western Australia.</para><para>Hopefully, media coverage will have alerted many of my constituents to the current risks and will have reminded them of the sensible warning `investor beware'. But that is not enough. Legislation, governments and regulators must be ready to improve conditions facing investors. I feel that investors and potential investors have good reason to feel let down by the new managed investments regime. Time and time again when the Managed Investments Bill was being debated and considered, the government assured Australians that the new regime would offer more protection than before, not less. The federal government is required to review the new managed investments regime—to see how it is working in practice—next year. The review needs to be genuine and rigorous. I would like to see this review seriously consider the ability for a managed investments scheme to be required to consider the option of using an independent trustee, something I argued for strongly in 1998. In an act of obduracy, which investors will pay for, Labor and the coalition refused to consider this proposal. The review also needs to consider if ASIC has enough of the right staff and the regulatory and policing teeth to do the job and do it properly. For this, ASIC needs adequate funding and to be backed by a government with a political will to warn of risky schemes and to stamp out shonky ones.</para><para>Even though ASIC's overall funding for 2000-01 was cut by $2 million, more of the ASIC cake is being devoted to investor protection monitoring and regulation than before. Such regulatory ability does not replace the additional oversight provided by trustees. Even at this early stage, when managed investment schemes have just finished transitioning to the new regime, problems are already arising. We may only be seeing the start of these unless the regime is strengthened. I urge the government to consider allowing managed schemes to opt to use an independent trustee; at the very least, I urge the use of an independent custodian be made mandatory and that ASIC be given the resources and teeth to perform its watchdog role properly and to ensure that investor protection is a reality, not just a catchcry. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Queensland</title><page.no>17627</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>17627</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, you may recall that four weeks ago I spoke in this chamber about the studies of society and environment syllabus recently produced by the Queensland School Curriculum Council. In that speech, I raised a number of concerns I had with the way Queensland children in grades 1 to 10 are being indoctrinated with a politically correct mixture of environmentalism, socialism and fashionably anti-Western sentiments—a rather trendy brew with no balance. As I said then, we get:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... democratic process without liberal democracy, social justice without individual justice, ecological and economic sustainability without economic development, and peace without security. </para></quote><para>I pointed out that our children are being forced by education bureaucrats to immerse themselves in all the failed ideologies of the last century under the pretext of studying history and geography.</para><para>I would like to report back to the Senate that, in the past four weeks, the criticism of the curriculum has not stopped back in Queensland. Many more individuals and groups from all walks of life and from all points of the ideological spectrum have been speaking out against this document. In fact, the only people to defend the curriculum were its authors at the Queensland School Curriculum Council. The fact that they have found themselves almost alone defending this deeply flawed piece of educational propaganda should, if anything, tell them something about the wisdom of their position. I say `almost alone' because the Queensland Teachers Union has come out in support of the curriculum, heralding it as a significant step in the right direction for the future of Queensland. It comes as no surprise to the people of Queensland that the Teachers Union is once again more interested in pushing its pet ideologies on to the unsuspecting minds of our children rather than actually teaching them about the world.</para><para>I would like to briefly bring to the Senate's attention some of the recent criticisms of the curriculum as reported in Queensland. In a recent report, Monash University historian Professor Tony Taylor criticised the trend—evident in the Studies of Society and Environment curriculum—towards abolishing history and geography as separate subjects with clearly defined learning objectives. States like New South Wales and Victoria continue to maintain a much clearer delineation between separate component subjects as well as a set of minimum standards and basic facts that have to be absorbed by students. Victorian based curriculum consultant Dr Kevin Donnelly is worried that this shift in teaching young students away from imparting basic knowledge to a skills and outcomes based approach will put our children at a disadvantage internationally. </para><para>Dr Donnelly observes that countries which produce the best educational results, such as Japan, Singapore or the Netherlands, espouse a more traditional approach—they teach children information before they require them to evaluate it, analyse it and think about it critically. In the global village, with its knowledge based economy, anything that puts our children at a future disadvantage against their peers elsewhere in the world amounts to a crime. It is quite ironic that, at a time when other states in Australia as well as other developed countries are moving away from curriculums like the Studies of Society and Environment, the Queensland education establishment is rushing in to embrace it. Even Brisbane's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, which even at the best of times is hardly a friend of conservative causes, has come out against the ideological excesses of the curriculum council. A recent editorial argued:</para><quote><para>The problem with Studies of Society and Environment are quite fundamental: it seems intent on delivering the values of those who wrote it at the expense of delivering useful knowledge for the children to whom it is directed.</para></quote><para>The editors take the curriculum to task for teaching Queensland students pop social science instead of imparting useful historical and geographical knowledge that will prepare them for life and employment in the new, highly competitive and flexible economy. These concerns are echoed by Mr Peter Botsman, from the Labor aligned think tank the Brisbane Institute. Mr Botsman argues that in its approach the curriculum council is stuck in a different time—a time of the welfare state and full employment, when it did not matter what children were taught at schools because, no matter what the knowledge or skills acquired, everyone would be guaranteed a job, even if a low skilled one. This is clearly not true today when enterprise, innovation and flexibility are the qualities that guarantee success. Mr Botsman's concerns echo those of my parliamentary colleague the Labor member for Griffith, Mr Kevin Rudd—an early and consistent critic of this curriculum. </para><para>Not very often can one expect the Labor Party to agree on an issue with industry representatives, but the authors of the curriculum have managed to achieve the impossible. Mr Andrew Craig, the Chief Executive Officer of the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Steve Wilson, stockbroker and business leader, and Mr David Whiting, the Queensland Director of the Australian Industry Group, all criticised the curriculum for its anti-business bias that ill prepares children of today for the challenges of the future. The curriculum provides children with a simplistic perspective: business bad, environmentalism good; development bad, nature good. Where things such as the economy, jobs and people's wellbeing fit into the whole picture is unfortunately unclear. Professor Ken Wiltshire, who in 1994 chaired the review of Queensland school curriculum, echoed these criticisms when he said—and I wholeheartedly endorse his statements:</para><quote><para>You've got to learn about the environment and ecological sustainability. But one of the things we don't teach enough is enterprise and initiative and the average school kid doesn't learn about what makes the economy tick.</para><para>A lot of them grow up being anti-business. They come out of school feeling that business is raping the environment and profits are screwing the workers. They also grow up believing they'll always be an employee. It would never occur to the average kid from a government school that they might be a boss and they might set up their own business.</para></quote><para>The responses to the curriculum I mentioned before give me enormous encouragement because they show that commonsense and concern for our children's future are far from dead and will not be silenced. People of my state can easily see through the educators' obsession with postmodernism, moral relativism and historical revisionism. The academics might find it difficult and confusing to deal with concepts like right and wrong, good and evil and making value judgments, but ordinary people fortunately have not lost their moral compass. People are not the unsophisticated, closed-minded reactionaries the educational establishment imagines them to be—they do not believe in censorship. There is nothing wrong in teaching children about various ideologies and points of view. However, the problem starts when all ideologies are treated as equals—when Menzies' liberal democracy is treated the same way as Mao's communism, which sent 60 million people to their graves, or worse: when Mao's communism is actually given a more favourable treatment than Menzies' liberal democracy—when, as I noted previously, the losers get to write, or rewrite, history.</para><para>The Studies of Society and Environment curriculum is a deeply flawed document that lets our children down very badly. It lets them down because it fails to do what the educational process is supposed to do—prepare children for adult life. The curriculum substitutes propaganda and indoctrination for basic knowledge. It teaches our children the wrong lessons about the past. It teaches our children to be morally blind. As such, it deserves to be condemned. The sooner it is withdrawn from Queensland schools, the better.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Battle of Britain</title><page.no>17628</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>17628</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The month of September marks the 60th commemoration of the Battle of Britain. `Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.' Those immortal words of Winston Churchill spoken in the British parliament on 20 August 1940 reflect so graphically the effect which the fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain had in creating a new spirit of pugnacious opposition to Hitler's military might during those dark days of 1940. It was a new spirit which was to be so important in sustaining the Allied forces through to eventual victory in 1945. </para></talk.start><para>Historians enjoy the exercise of evaluating the most significant turning point in battles and campaigns in world history. Among those listed are the successful defence of the ancient Egyptians against the Hittites, the ancient Greeks against Persia and the Romans against Hannibal. The consequences of defeat in any of these examples would have greatly changed the history of civilisation as we know it. In modern times, there can be no greater example of a turning point than the events of 60 years ago: the first aerial military campaign which led to the prevention of Hitler's occupation of Britain in 1940—the Battle of Britain. No-one can argue that the course of World War II was irrevocably altered by the fact that Hitler was unable to secure Britain and therefore consolidate his complete domination of central and western Europe.</para><para>We lucky ones who did not have to live through those terrible times can only guess at the actual sacrifices and stresses that those people endured. Our deep felt gratitude goes to those who fought so bravely on the other side of the world, including some brave Australians, during those traumatic weeks 60 years ago. So many gave their lives for a vital cause. Their contribution was unique, and they will find an appropriate place when future historians evaluate the battles on which civilisation has been built. It is most appropriate that we remember at this time what they gave us. They were but a few, but their service was outstanding. They inspired a new spirit which turned the course of the war.

This level of categorisation applies to occurrences where the facts suggest neither a significant concern for public safety nor a serious safety deficiency.  </para><para>CASA has advised that it has received numerous letters of complaint over the five-year period, starting in 1995, from three residents on Fraser Island.  The complaints mainly concerned operators' landing and taking off operations on the beach.  One resident in particular has frequently made allegations about landings outside of approved Department of Environment (DOE) landing areas, which allegedly narrowly missed vehicles and pedestrians.

Post-flight investigation confirmed it to be an indication problem, apparently due to some material left in the pressure line during a recent refit.  This was assessed as a category 5 incident.  Later the same day, near the same location, a charter pilot was forced to take action to avoid an oncoming private aircraft.
