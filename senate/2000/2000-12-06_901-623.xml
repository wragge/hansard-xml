Just as museums around the world are rethinking their role and purpose in society as they face the new millennium, the National Museum of Australia has also been defining its role as a museum for the 21st century.</para><para>As a new museum opening in the new millennium, the National Museum of Australia cannot simply be a traditional museum concept with new technology.  Both educational and entertaining, the Museum will employ a fresh and exciting approach to Australian history, culture and the environmentâpresenting its varied subject matter through the blending of exhibits, technology, media, live performance and hands-on activities within dynamic architectural and landscape spaces.</para><para>As a modern cultural institution, the National Museum must be provided with the proper equipment and functionality to enable it to operate successfully within this new environment as a premier cultural heritage resource for the Australian nation.  The National Museum's powers to undertake the range of activities it proposes requires the foundation of an appropriate legal framework.</para><para>The National Museum of Australia Amendment Bill 2000 is an essential part of that framework.  It makes several critical and other desirable amendments to the National Museum of Australia Act 1980 to ensure that the Museum opening in March 2001 has the power to undertake the range of activities it proposes to engage in.</para><para>The Bill has its origins in the need to bring the Act up to date for the opening of the National Museum in March 2001 as the flagship for the Centenary of Federation.  It will clarify that the National Museum can engage fully in its proposed activities.</para><para>Against this background the Bill has as its main objectives:</para></quote><para>Â·	to allow the Museum of exhibit material which relates to Australia's future as well as its past;</para><para>Â·	to clarify that the Museum can undertake a range of fund raising activities;</para><para>Â·	to allow the Museum to establish a Fund;</para><para>Â·	to increase the value of historical material which may be disposed of without Ministerial approval; and</para><para>Â·	to correct a technical error to relate disclosure of pecuniary interest to the relevant sections of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.</para><quote><para>The functions of the Museum include exhibiting historical material and holding temporary exhibitions of other material.  The Museum proposes to exhibit a permanent children's exhibition on the future of cities through a 3D presentation.  To allow the Museum to permanently exhibit material relating to Australia's future as well as its past, a new function has been added to this effect. </para><para>In relation to fund raising, the Act is being amended to better reflect the commercial requirements in relation to the Museum's functions.  While some of the proposed activities are arguably already within power, others are not and any amendments have been modelled on those of other national cultural institutions, in particular the Australian National Maritime Museum Act 1990, as it is more recently drafted and reflects the commercial activities generally expected to be undertaken by modern cultural institutions.  For those proposed activities which are arguably within power, amendments have been made to expressly confirm such powers.</para><para>These functions include the power to charge fees for services provided in relation to its functions.  Such services include guided tours, lectures and audio tours.  They also include the Museum actively seeking to raise funds through the holding of events, acceptance of gifts, devises, bequests or assignments made to the Museum and the raising of money through sponsorships.</para><para>While the Museum has the power to accept such gifts, bequests and money from the disposal of property, devices, bequests and assignments, an amendment is proposed to empower the Museum to establish a Fund in which to deposit these funds.  The clause is based on a similar provision in the National Gallery Act 1975.</para><para>An additional issue that has been addressed is the value of material for which Ministerial approval is required before disposal action can be undertaken.  The value of material for which Ministerial approval is required was set at $20,000 when the Act commenced.  The amendment provides for the limits to be increased to $250,000 and is consistent with the limits set in the National Library Act 1960, to better reflect current values.</para><para>A technical error has also been addressed in the amendments to ensure a correct referral to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 as it relates to disclosure of pecuniary interests by the Council.</para><para>It is critical that amendments be in place before the Museum opens in March 2001.   This will allow the Museum to make a smooth transition from the current arrangements into the more commercial environment in which it will operate after opening.</para></quote><para>âââââ</para><para>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</para><quote><para>This Bill clarifies and improves the operation of the amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that were made by the Broadcasting Services (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000.</para><para>First, the Bill amends the enabling legislation of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service to expressly confer on these national broadcasters the function of providing datacasting services in accordance with datacasting licences allocated by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.</para><para>The digital television amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act passed by the Parliament earlier this year provided for the allocation of datacasting licences by the ABA to commercial free to air television broadcasters, the ABC and SBS and to new service providers.  The amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act also provided for the ABC and SBS to be taken to have the statutory function of providing datacasting services, where they have applied for and been allocated a datacasting licence by the ABA.</para><para>It is appropriate that the statutory powers and functions of the national broadcasters be provided in their enabling legislation.  This Bill therefore amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 respectively to confirm that, where the ABC or SBS have applied for and been allocated a datacasting licence by the ABA, they have the statutory function of providing a datacasting service in accordance with the conditions of their datacasting licence.  Existing provisions in Schedule 6 of the BSA that are made redundant by the amendments to the ABC Act and SBS Act are to be repealed.  ABC and SBS datacasting services will continue to be subject to the licence conditions in Schedule 6 of the BSA.</para><para>Second, the Bill makes a number of  minor amendments to the provisions of the BSA inserted by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000.</para></quote><para>âââââ</para><para>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2000</para><quote><para>The purpose of this Bill is to make consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in legislation administered within the Environment and Heritage portfolio. These amendments are intended to ensure that when Chapter Two of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code) is applied to pre-existing portfolio offence provisions, from 15 December 2001, those provisions will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously. If legislation containing offence provisions were not amended in the ways proposed by this Bill, the Criminal Code may alter the interpretation of existing offence provisions. Chapter Two of the Criminal Code, which contains the General Principles of Criminal Responsibility, has been applied to new offences since 1 January 1997. It will apply to all Commonwealth offences from 15 December 2001.  </para><para>Chapter Two of the Criminal Code adopts the common law approach of subjective fault based principles. It adopts the traditional distinction of dividing offences into actus reus and mens rea but uses the plainer labels of physical elements and fault elements. The general rule is that for each physical element of an offence it is necessary to prove that the defendant had the relevant fault element. The prosecution must prove every physical and fault element of an offence. The physical elements are conduct, result of conduct, and circumstances of conduct. The fault elements specified in the Code are intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence. The default fault elements, which the Criminal Code provides, will apply where a fault element is not specified, and where the offence (or an element of the offence) is not specified to be a strict or absolute liability offence. These default fault elements are intention for a physical element of conduct, and recklessness for a physical element of circumstances or result. A fault element can only be dispensed with in relation to an offence (or in relation to a particular element of an offence) if the offence specifies that it is a strict or absolute liability offence (or that a particular element is a strict or absolute liability element). In the absence of express reference to the fact that an offence is either a strict or absolute liability offence, after the application of the Criminal Code, the offence would not be interpreted in the same way as it would before the application of the Code. In other words a court would be obliged to interpret an offence provision as a fault offence and no longer as a strict liability offence, and would require the proof of fault elements in relation to the physical elements. </para><para>I have also taken the opportunity presented by the harmonisation process to make several additional amendments that bring my portfolio's legislation more closely into accord with the Criminal Code, which is that defendants generally should bear an evidential and not a legal burden. Items 15 to 16 of the Bill change the burden of proof on the defendant in subsection 8(2) of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981 from a legal burden to an evidential burden. Similarly items 37 to 39 of the Bill amend subsection 21A(4) of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 to change the current legal burden on the defendant, which is to `prove' the defence in subsection (4), to an evidential burden. These are desirable amendments because they harmonise the Acts with the Code, and they have been approved by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Justice and Customs.</para><para>This Bill amends the following Acts: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981, the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989, the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Act 1998, and the Ozone Protection Act 1989, the Sea Installations Act 1987, and the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982.</para><para>I commend the Bill.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 autumn sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>20815</page.no><id.no>S258</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>20815</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 5 December.  </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>20815</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy amendment has been encompassed by government amendments (1) and (2).

The name of the billâthe <inline ref="S258">Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000</inline>âis a misnomer. It is not a moratorium bill. It is a bill that will selectively allow some entities which are legally entitled to operate to continue to operate. So how can you call the bill a moratorium? In effect, the bill will bring about a situation where the government is selecting who can and who cannot operate. This has been Pauline Hanson's One Nation's objection to this bill all the way through. If the government intends to enact a moratorium, it should do so right across the board and exclude all Australians from being able to access Internet gambling. That is not the intention of the government. As I said, it is the intention of the government to allow selective companies to operate while excluding others who have a legal licence; they have a right.</para><para>The representative state governments have accepted application fees. In some cases these are as high as $300,000. The federal government is riding roughshod over the rights of the states. The amendment that I have put before the chamber will have the effect of giving that legal right, which has been obtained, to all of those companies before the date the government has selected. It is the federal government that has selected this dateâ19 Mayâas the cut-off point, not the states. It also raises the issue that the federal government, having enacted this bill, then is responsible for the restitution. This is one of the main issues that has motivated Pauline Hanson's One Nation to bring forward this amendment. This amendment would remove what, I believe, is the potential for these operators to take legal action against the federal government. I have some indication that that is what they intend to do if this bill is passed in its unamended form. </para><para>I place it very clearly on record that I voted for this bill to be brought on to be discussed for two reasons. Firstly, we have an industry that has invested something like $350 million in Internet technology. They have been in no-man's land for a period of time. The five or six companies that I am referring to that have their licences but will be shut down by this bill are faced with having to notify their employees that maybe tomorrow they will not have a job. I do not envy them their task. They are providing employment and, in doing that, they are also supporting a considerable number of families. </para><para>I believe this is one time when the Labor Party could justifiably support a Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment because the amendment will ensure the continuation of employment for those employees involved in the Internet gambling industry. The amendment that I bring forward will assist both companies, substantially in Tasmania but also here in the ACT. I commend the Pauline Hanson's One Nation amendment because it will enable those legitimate companies which did have their licences prior to 19 May to continue. It most certainly will assist in removing the possibility of legal challenges as a result of this bill and it will also help the employees within the industry. I commend the amendments to the chamber.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>20817</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, if I could just explain to the chamber a procedural matter.

By my reckoning, looking at the penalty units to be imposed on individuals and firms who are to be guilty of an offence under this act, there are prescribed penalty units of $2,000. So that is $220,000 in respect of each day on which a separate offence is committed. I point out that that means, effectively, that this legislation respectively makes illegal what is currently legal. Those firms that have, in the case of Federal Hotels, invested $15 million in developing a product, obtained a licence and are now operating under a legal regime put in place by the state Liberal government are retrospectively made illegal and subject to a $220,000 a day penalty if they continue to operate. That is serious in itself.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is the minister's view about the way in which commercial investors will observe and make a judgment about a company like Federal Hotels retrospectively having a major product they have developed being declared illegal. I think that will lead to a significant question mark over the probity of a company like Federal Hotelsâquite wrongly. That is a bad hit for Federal Hotels. They have developed a legal product and are a good corporate citizen that currently employs 1,400 peopleâa not insignificant number of peopleâin Tasmania. To effectively prohibit them in this wayâafter they have put $15 million into a product which will significantly impact on their bottom line because they can no longer tradeâis an extraordinary penalty to impose when all the time the boundaries of this legislation are being moved out. </para><para>We have the Senator Brown amendment in respect to the Tasmanian TAB. Whilst I am on my feet, I would like Senator Brown to explain what benefit that confers on the Tasmanian TAB when they have not developed online betting. The effect of Senator Brown's amendment and deal with the government, as I understand, is to support the Tasmanian TAB. In effect, they have not developed online betting. What it does is confer a benefit on those states where the TABs have developed online betting, and that is not Tasmania. I understand it is New South Wales. So I do not understand why Senator Brown has entered into that agreement with the government. The application of the further exemption the government is giving in response to Senator Brown does not apply evenly. I do not understand why Senator Brown has taken the position he has. Perhaps he can explain that to the chamber. </para><para>For the reasons that Senator Lundy and some others have very effectively outlined, this piece of legislation has draconian impacts on legitimate businesses acting under the current law which have invested significant amounts of money. It is monumentally hypocritical of the government to be presenting a piece of legislation like thisâabsolutely hypocriticalâand gamblers are going to move offshore and gamble in jurisdictions where there may or may not be any controls, checks or balances. I know Senator Harris is keen on his amendment; but, even with that amendment, the whole bill is manifestly flawed and should not be passed by this chamber. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>20817</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe first point to make is that this is a moratorium on new services; it is not a moratorium on absolutely everything that moves.

That to me is an acceptable outcome, because we are just drawing a qualitative distinction between sports betting, wagering, and all those other activities that most senators seem to find iniquitous. I simply want to make it clear that, if Senator Harris's amendment were to get up, that effectively guts this whole legislation. It would allow virtually everyone in. The moratorium would be meaningless.

There are six companies that would be allowed to operate, those companies having received their licences prior to the 19 May cut-off. The proliferation of applications after that will not be allowed to operate. For clarity for the chamber, the only companies that would be able to operate if this amendment is passed would be TABCORP, Tattersalls, ecorp, Betworks, Federal Hotels and GOCORP.

Nobody in this chamber, I believe, has objected to the government's amendment that removes wagering. But that is exactly what it does do. It only removes wagering. It has no effect on the entities that have a legal right to carry out Internet gambling. It is time that we put very clearly on the record the self-regulation that these companies are proposing. They are proposing that, to be able to operateâor to `play', for want of a better wordâon their interactive sites, a person will have had to nominate the maximum that they can spend on a monthly basis. They also have to nominate how much they can spend in any one period that they interact with the sites. If they reach the nominated level or limit that they have set for themselves in any one period they are online, they cannot change that; they must go offline and then come back online. They would then be subjected to the limit they have put for themselves on the monthly basis. So with interactive gambling, the Internet interactive gambling industry has far more stringent controls on it than there are, as I said yesterday, relating to a person on Friday night walking into the pub with their pay packet in their hip pocket and being able to feed the entire amount down the throat of a poker machine. The Internet gambling or interactive gambling industry has put in place sufficient steps to ensure that the person is as well aware of what they are doing as the industry can assist them to be. The problem that we have in Australia relating to gambling is not at this point in time related to Internet gambling. </para></talk.start><para>Again, for clarity, I say that the amendment that we propose only relates to gaming. It has no effect whatsoever on wagering, because the government has covered that issue. It will not lead to a proliferation of sites being able to operate; it will only in effect allow the five companies who had a legitimate right up until nowâto this pointâto operate. It would allow them to continue to operate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>20819</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy position on this matter may be understood from the point of view that I think poker machines are invading, more and more, the economic wellbeing of people around the country. I think they are quite different from horseracing, harness racing and dog racing. I think there is a big difference between a poker machine factory and the people it employs and the racing industryâwhich is not, by the way, noted for its green voting background, if you like, but which is nevertheless a big employer and a time-honoured employer in all states of Australia, not least Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>That having been said, I am going to be watching the big event which comes in May next year, when we actually get down to what we are going to do permanently about betting online. This is a stopgap measure here. It does not tie us into what we do next year. Next year we are going to have a choice between prohibition or a tightly regulated national system to which the states and territories have agreed. That is going to be the choice that we have. I reiterate: I see poker machines and their spread right throughout the community as something that needs to be hauled in, and the states have not been effective in doing that. One only has to read the articles in the press recently about the impact of pokies on towns like Bendigo and Wagga Wagga and the amount of money that is being taken out of the communities through these machines, non-productively, to understand that we as legislators are required to do something about it. If the states are not effective insofar as going up the street and betting on poker machines is concerned, then at least we have to see that when this phenomenon comes online it is not going to stay at 0.6 per cent of the betting revenue in this country; it is going to grow rapidly. It makes poker machines, which are truly interactive in a way that horse racing is not, available in the home at any hour of the day. You turn on your computer; you have the poker machines whirring right in front of you at the click of a button, and you can start betting. That is not the case with racesâhorse races, dog races and so onâwhich are not interactive in that way. So there are two breeds of gambling involved here and there are two options: one is prohibition and the other is some form of very tight regulation. Those are the parameters of the big debate coming down the line. </para><para>I have cited the reasons in supporting the government amendment last night. The Western Australian facility for online betting on gamingâthat is, horse races, et ceteraâhas been available since June; the Victorians have sports betting up and are about to have the facility available on racing; and the Tasmanian TAB is developing its facilities for the coming months.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âI don't think that's right.

It affects licences issued in Tasmania. But we are going to make a much harder decision next year, and I am not going to be one who supports open slather availability of poker machine facilities in every home in the country. On the other hand, I am not a prohibitionist. We are going to have to make tough decisions about where we draw that line, and I am going to respect everybody in this place in the matter of where they draw that line. The community is going to be involved in that debate.

Senator Harris, I understand what you are trying to do by this amendment. I think it is clear the numbers are not in your favour. That is the case for a lot of amendments that would not simply enhance what is a poorly thought out bill but might actually protect the government in the event of court cases that may eventuate as a consequence of the retrospective nature of this legislation.

I find the convenient hypocrisy of some of those in the chamber extraordinaryâthat people would actually allow that amendment to go through! `If it quacks like a duck ...' it is gambling, folks. If the government can get its legislation through that way, then obviously it is prepared to do it, and people are prepared to compromise their morals and principles in the process. Can we just get on with this debate, Chair? Let's not pretend this is about our social concern for problem gambling. Everyone shares that concern, but I do not believe that we are doing anything today that is alleviating those concerns.

Let me say in response to Senator Harris that I do not intend to support any extension of gambling whether you dress it up in legal dress or not. The problem is, of course, that self-regulation of gambling outlets is ineffective. Let us have a look at GOCORP, which Senator Harris mentioned. In Queensland, where regulation has been put in place, GOCORP was an absolute scandal. When it was set up, the Treasurer of Queensland allowed three Labor mates to be the principals of the company that established GOCORP. When he was caught out, he had to stand aside until the matter was dealt with. That is the kind of activity that is allowed by self-regulation. It does not work. I certainly support the government. It is the only time in any parliament in this country that any government has tried to do something about limiting gambling. Every other piece of legislation passed by state or federal or any other government in this country has always legitimised the extension of gambling. I will quote from a letter from Reverend Tim Costello, in which he urges us to support the bill today:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Legislation had the unintended consequence of normalising and mainstreaming gambling in a way that has caused social misery.

As I said last night, in the areas where I work I come across the impact of problem gambling quite frequently.</para></talk.start><para>I will briefly broaden the debate slightly beyond Senator Harris's amendment to the issue that gambling is supposedly a part of the Australian psyche. Reverend Costello put out a book just recently attacking that notion. I very much support his view that it is not something particular about the Australian culture. Indeed, it is one of the big areas not just in my work in welfare areas but in my other responsibilities for immigration and multicultural issues. The area of problem gambling and its impacts on ethnic communities has not been given enough attention. Newly arrived or more recently arrived people obviously would not have had time to absorb the so-called Australian special attraction to gambling, but those people also have gambling problems in their communities. It is not a peculiarly Australian trait. In some respects, the problems in some communities of different ethnic backgrounds are more serious than those for the general Australian community because of aspects to do with their culture.</para><para>One thing about the Australian culture is that overall there is no shame attached to gambling. There is obviously shame if you get out of control with it, as with any other addiction, but on the whole there is not the shame that attaches to some ethnic backgrounds where people who do have a gambling problem may be less able to come out about it because of broader social constraints. I raise that issue in the context that statements have been made by people from all sides of this debate who are keen to get greater commitments from governments at all levels to tackle problem gambling issues. This is one area that I think has not been given enough attention. It also shows that it is not a problem that goes down one single line. It is a problem that is multifaceted, and we need to take a multifaceted approach in relation to it.</para><para>I would like to respond to a couple of comments by Senator Brown. I acknowledge that it is a difficult decision for him, but nonetheless I think it is appropriate to respond to a couple of the statements he has made. He was speaking about his concern about the immediacy and the availability of gambling online. Noting that point, it is all the more curious why that immediacy will now be able to continue unfettered for horseracing and other forms of gambling. As I said last night, the even more immediate access in the home relies on phone betting, and that will be able to continue unfettered. Horseracing in particular is there virtually all the time. Particularly if you have pay television, you can pretty much get a steady stream of horseracingânot just Australian horseracing but racing from around the globe. That is an area that we will expand further so that people who have an interest in gambling on horses will be able to do so at home for many, many hours a day, if not close to 24 hours a day. They will be able, through phone betting accounts or online accounts, to continue to gamble in that way. </para><para>Whatever side we are taking in this debate, we have all acknowledged that pokies are the big problem, and this makes it all the more breathtaking that we are supporting legislation that will provide a fillip for the pokie industry. Let's not pretend that horseracing is some squeaky clean thing. Pokies are the big problem, by a long way, but there are a significant number of problem gamblers in the Australian community who express their gambling addiction through horseracing and, to a lesser extent, through other sporting events. While it is nowhere near as big as pokies, it is a significant component, and the suggestion that gambling on horseracing is a noble activity belies the reality for those of us who deal with gambling victims. </para><para>In terms of activities of state governments, I very briefly touched on activities of Mr Michael Moore in the ACT Legislative Assembly. I would like to expand on that and indicate my support for his actions in moving this week to redirect political donations from gaming machines to charities. He outlined that the amount of political donations from the gaming machine lobby and clubs just in the ACT during the last election year was over $1.3 million. The legislation that he is proposing would require a general obligation for every club to donate five per cent of those profits, rising to seven per cent in two years, to the community. Total profits from gaming machinesâthis is just in the ACT, I presumeâgrew from $92.7 million to over $100 million last year, yet donations to the community fell. Of $9 million more in profits, nothing had gone to the community, so Mr Moore is seeking to prescribe that more money flow through to charities. He is specifically looking at trying to ensure that gaming machine operators who make donations to political parties be obliged to make matching donations to charities. That is only one area of activity, and it is obviously not going to address the whole issue of pokie problems but, as is being demonstrated through the outcome of this legislation, the lobbying power of the pokie industry is immense. That is why they will no doubt be so pleased that they have had a successful outcome with this legislation. </para><para>I think I should acknowledge, for those people who have taken the trouble, that a number of emails are coming through from people who are employed in this area. From the look of the emails, it appears to be people particularly from Tasmania. I would imagine that many people have not had the chance, amongst everything else they have had to do, to check their email in the last few hours, but it is worth doing if for no other reason than to acknowledge these people's opinions. They are clearly concerned that their jobs will be at risk as a result of this legislation, and I think that needs to be noted in the context of this particular amendment. This amendment does not go specifically to horseracing but does, as I understand it, recognise people's concern and belief that it is best for this temporary moratorium on new Australian based online gambling services to go ahead and at least try to ensure that it does not have the unintended consequence of impacting on people's existing jobs. I think that is a noble intent, and I think it is worth acknowledging the expression of concern that is out there in terms of those people who are employed. If the minister can assure us all that none of those people's jobs are at risk and that they are unduly concerned, I am sure they would welcome that assurance. Certainly we would all welcome the minister's assurance that that is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>20823</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn that last point, and it is a very important one, I want to remind the committee that the jobs issue is not as simple as it looks. There are estimates that for every job created in the gambling industry two are lost in the retail industry. The money that goes into the poker machines does not go into the retail sector and it does not go into other uses. That is the sort of matter that we need to clarify in the next six months. I also note that one of the letters from Tasmania today said that the gambling that is being established in Tasmania will not be available in Australia; it is for people overseas. I acknowledge that, but people overseas are people. We have a responsibility to consider the impact of gambling on themâwhether they are sitting in Vanuatu, Colorado or Cape Townâas well as on the citizens at home. When we set up an industry which impacts on people elsewhere, we have to look at that impact. Not only do we have a right to do so but I think there is a requirement that we do so. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett said that I had said that gambling on horseracing is a noble pursuit. I would ask him to go back through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and show where I said that. I said nothing of the sort. We have to be careful in this debate to listen to each other and to recognise that everybody is going to have a very hard decision to make, particularly next year. We are not going to agree with each other, because we are dealing with a very complicated and potentially vexatious issue. It will help if we respect each other's difficulties in coming to a decision on the matter. I for one find it extraordinarily difficult, and I am going to be doing a lot of homework on this matter in the coming months. </para><para>Senator Stott Despoja said that people are prepared to compromise their morals and principles in the process of that decision making. I do not think that is the case. I do not think it is the case for her. It is not the case in my situation, and I do not think it applies to any other person in this committee. We have to make decisions which will be impossible for any of us to be entirely satisfied with. They are tough decisions, and we are going to be lobbied by people in the industry as well as people outside it. But, when we talk about the effect on the jobs of people in the online industry which is setting up poker machine facilities, let us not forget that there are people at the other end of that process who are affected as well. The senators who are concerned about thatâand I acknowledge that concern because I share itâshould come to Tasmania with me and sit down with some of those people who have had their lives destroyed by poker machines. They have had their houses, their jobs and their relationships all go through the poker machines. It has devastated not only them but also other people, including their families and friends, and it has affected the way they feel about themselves. They are at the addictive end of the spectrum of the impact of poker machines.</para><para>This legislation is not about people going to a gambling house and coming to grief through poker machines per se, but it is about extending that facility into the living rooms and houses of anybody. It is going to be an increasing component of the gambling turnover in Australia and it is going to add to the total component of the economy. We are at the start of what is going to be universally available access to gambling in a way that there has never been before. I am supporting this moratorium, but I reiterate that our really difficult decision is coming six months down the line. It is going to involve jobs, livelihoods and huge economic, social and environmental factors. It going to be a hard decision to make. I find this one hard today, but I am sticking with the position that I have had all the way through. Nevertheless, my mind will be open to change in the coming six months, and I expect that it the case with everybody else in this chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>20824</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is fascinating that we have been here for nearly an hour this morning and most of the contributions have related in some way to the social harm caused by poker machines.

A distinction has been created by the governmentâa differentiation advocated previously by some members of the crossbench and supported by a majority of senators. So it is a different picture now. But it is not even about online gaming. Timing of the moratorium means that, if you were providing online gaming services before 19 May, you are allowed to keep doing that. I acknowledge the efforts by Senator Harris to identify the peculiar irony that, if this bill actually goes through today, this crucial date of 19 May differentiates between whether you have a legal business or an illegal business. The inconsistencies of this ludicrous retrospectivity and operational date of this moratorium that Senator Harris and Senator Harradine have identified really sheet home why Labor cannot support not only these amendments but also the bill. For these reasons, we will not be supporting this bill on its third reading. </para><para>I want to add one more point. This bill is not even about stopping Australians gambling in the minute stratum that is left after all of these exemptions and after the operational date of the moratorium, because it has absolutely nothing to do with trying to prevent Australian citizens from accessing online gambling sites that may emanate from other quarters of this globeâthat is, outside the shores of Australia. So when you cut away all the chaff here we are left with a bill that is not actually going to do very much at all. But we find ourselves here agonising over the social harm associated with problem gambling, which we know stems primarily from poker machines. It is causing a great deal of moral angst for Senator Brown, Senator Harradine, the Democrats, Labor, Liberal and everyone else. That is the game that the Prime Minister chose to play when he put forward his rhetoric on the interactive gambling bill. There is nothing more dishonest or misleading to the Australian public than to stand in here and pretend that this bill in some way, shape or form does anything to address the issues that concern us in relation to gambling. For these reasons, Labor will be consistent in opposing the fallacy that this bill is addressing these concerns, and we will be opposing not only these amendments but also all amendments and the third reading. I implore those on the crossbench to do exactly the same thing. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20825</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome Senator Lundy's belated acknowledgment that this bill is not about addressing the poker machine scourge. It would have been helpful, I think, if she had gone further and acknowledged that that is, indeed, the role of the Ministerial Council on Gambling. She should also have acknowledged the fact that COAG has made a series of recommendations to address that problem. The undertakings that were given to Senator Woodley also move very much in that direction. I think that Senator Woodley and others were certainly entitled to take gross exception to Senator Stott Despoja's characterisation of anyone who supported these amendments as compromising their morals and principles. Senator Brown, I thought, struck the right tone. I say in passing to those who like to pretend that somehow harm minimisation will accommodate problem gamblers that the further you go in terms of tightening the domestic regime, the more likely it is that you actually encourage people who are determined to gamble to go offshore and take advantage of some of those much less salubrious sites.</para></talk.start><para>I will conclude by saying that I hope no-one here, outside or in the media will take seriously the suggestion by Senator Harris that 1,400 people are going to lose their jobs tomorrow. This is reminiscent of what ARIA said about CD imports when Senator Lundy was enthusiastically supporting their cause. They said that 55,000 jobs would be lost, but I would be very surprised if you could demonstrate that one job has been lost in that area. As I understand it, 1,400 jobs may well represent the total number of full- and part-time employees of Federal Hotels and Wrest Point, but do not for a moment think that somehow this amendment is going to close down Wrest Point. The number of people employed in online casino activities would be minuscule in comparison with that number. All those peopleâand certainly their employersâhave been on notice for some 12 months that there was likely to be action taken in this place. Whilst one can always decry a loss of employment, as I have said on other occasions, that does not justify the establishment of heroin farms in Australia any more than it should deter the parliament from taking the tough decisions that Senator Brown referred to if we believe they are in the national and social interest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>20825</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have listened carefully to this debate and, of course, I listened carefully and contributed to the debate on the last occasion. I was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies which brought forward the report called <inline font-style="italic">Netbets: a review of online gambling in Australia</inline>. That was the remit that we were given: a review of online gambling in Australia. It was upon that remit that persons throughout Australia made submissions and gave evidence to the committee, and we delivered the report. There is a lot of evidence in that report which has been adverted toâbut not often using the name of the witnessâin the contributions that have been made in the chamber. There is a need to come to a definite decision on online gambling in Australia. One thing that I agree with the minister on is that, in respect of poker machines, there is a difficulty with any federal legislation as to what power in the Constitution one would rely upon. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âWe could find a treaty.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>âThere must be a treaty somewhere, that is true. There is the corporations power but normally that is not used in this sort of situation, although I have a feeling that it should be used more oftenâbut not in the industrial relations area, of course. As the minister said, that is the responsibility of COAG and, in fact, that body has considered the matter. One of the problems that we were faced with in considering this matter was that the states were hell-bent on getting revenue as quickly as they could through gaming, including online gaming. We have to try to clean up the mess or attempt to consider what the mess is. I know that a number of states have also been very concerned at the final outcome. The amendment that is currently before us does address a problem which it is necessary to address: whether or not those persons and companies that were provided with a licence but had not yet engaged in the service of online betting have an argument.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As you would recall, Mr Temporary Chairman, late into the early hours of yesterday morning we were talking about the need for precision in legislation and the need for certainty before the law. The argument that has been put forward as the basis for this particular amendment is an argument of fairness, and the difference that I have with the government is simply on the question of whether or not a licence was provided, rather than whether a service was being engaged. Whilst the government includes in this legislation a person who was already providing a licence, there is a strong argument that it is fairer to include those who were licensed to provide the service as well before the particular date of 19 May 2000. It is a fairly strong argument that, in fairness, those who were licensed to provide the service prior to 19 May should be exempted as well as those persons already providing the licence. If the amendment were accepted, it would prohibit a person from providing an interactive gambling service unless that person was already providing or was licensed to provide the service before 19 May 2000âand Senator Harris has nominated some of the organisations and individuals that would be affected.</para><para>The question now is whether or not the committee will support this amendment. I think there is much to commend the amendment. As I said, it is very similar to the one that I circulated but, on reflection, I felt that the one circulated by Senator Harris was tighter and therefore I am supporting that amendment. With respect, could I suggest to the Labor Party that they should seriously consider voting for this amendment. They know how the numbers will fall when the third reading occurs and they know that the government has the numbers to have this legislation go through, even without my vote.</para><para>I am very concerned that, as has been recommended by the committee that considered this matter over months, there needs to be a pause, some sort of moratorium, and obviously some very hard decisions are going to have to be made at the end of that moratorium period. So I do suggest to the Labor Party that it should vote for this amendment in the full knowledge that the government's legislation for a moratorium is going to get up anyhow. Thus this legislation will be amended by this amendment, whichâas I indicatedâappears to be supported by the arguments of fairness and certainty before the law; two arguments which are very important, particularly in this chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>20826</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would just like to respond briefly to that. To begin now to contemplate some discretionary exemptions would defy the basis upon which Labor has approached this bill from the start. I would also like to say that, on my counting, Senator Harradine, it will depend upon which side of the chamber you find yourself on in the division as to whether or not this bill will get up on the third reading.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>20826</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI place it very clearly on the record, as I have done previously, that I believe that we should stop and look at online gambling. But that has to be tempered by what happens with this amendment because, as Senator Harradine has put it so very well, there are legal ramifications relating to the bill as the government has drafted it. I believe that, if the bill is passed without this amendment, there will be considerable difficulties for state governments and the Commonwealth government. Let me say very clearly that, if this amendment is supported, I will support the government's bill for the moratorium; however, if the amendment is voted down, I believe that the legal implications of this bill in its present state are such that we would be better off without the moratorium. I also say to Senator Brown that I hope that, if this amendment is voted down, he will make an undertaking to respond to those people who will lose their jobs and personally explain to them his reason for voting the way that he has indicated he will vote. In closing, because this bill is so polarised as to issues relating to the states, I remind senators that our purpose for being in this chamber is to view the legislation in relation to how it will impact on our states. That is the purpose behind the formation of this house. I commend the amendment to the chamber. </para></talk.start><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harris's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:49:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.M.

Those who have read the report will note the supplementary remarks and the recommendations in support of online gambling by Senator John Tierney and me. After considering the matters absolutely thoroughly, we were very concerned that action be taken. We said that there were some useful recommendations in the committee's general report but we should take action now on the question of whether or not Internet gambling should be extended and, with its consequent ease of access in the home, whether that would exacerbate the already unacceptably high incidence of problem gamblers and, if it did, we should, as policy makers, take every step to prevent it. If honourable senators will look at those comments it will save me reading them into the record.</para></talk.start><para>I believeâand the committee as a whole acknowledgedâthat there were very serious issues. Obviously, realise that the most serious domestic gambling issue is poker machines. The question is: what do we do now? I believe that having a moratorium was second-best, but at least those recommendations proposed something that would help address the very real dangers and problems that are facing our society in this area. Another problem I haveâand the problem that Senator Harris and I attempted to deal withâwas one of certainty for those organisations which, though they were not delivering a service at the time the axe fell, on 19 May 2000, nevertheless had been issued with licences to do so. That matter was put to the chamber. Absolutely no-one disagreed with the logic behind that amendment. </para><para>I am concerned that both the government and the opposition have taken an intransigent view about that amendment and the importance of that amendment. Under the circumstances it places me in a difficult position, that amendment having been rejected when it should have been accepted by the opposition, at least, and by the government. As I say, there were no serious arguments advanced against that amendment other than the statement made by the opposition spokesperson that, `We have taken the attitude towards this legislation that we are not going to entertain any amendments and we will just vote it down.' That is not the way to handle legislation in this chamber because it presupposes that nobody has any brains other than those who adopt that particular attitude. If they are talking about me they are probably right, but not so others. We should be open to suggestions for improving legislation even though that legislation is not considered to be appropriate. At the end of the day you have the opportunity to vote on the third reading. </para><para>The matter is of such a serious nature, and the moratorium now having only a reasonably short period to run, I am at this point of time inclined to support the third reading, though I do so with a degree of concern. The matter is of such grave importance that the moratorium needs to run its course. At the end of that moratorium we hope we will have the review by NOIE and also by other government and private organisations so that then we can make the decisions. As has been said around the chamber, the decision as to what we finally do with the online gambling situation in Australia is going to be a hard one. </para><para>So under those circumstances I would be interested if anybody were getting up to indicate where they stand on the third reading. I would prefer not to vote for the third reading, given the problem between those two areas. We have offered the chamber an appropriate amendment which, I tell the committee, would have satisfied the situation so far as I am concernedâthat is to say, satisfied the question as to whether that area of fairness had been properly attended to, but also satisfied me in my intention. In my view, the matter is of such importance that there should be a moratorium and then recommendations flowing from the various reports so that we have information on which to base a reasoned decision for the common good of the people of Australia.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>20830</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to indicate to the chamber that I can no longer support the <inline ref="S258">Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000</inline> at the third reading.

The case is that, the way in which the government have structured the bill and the chamber has dealt with amendments put to that bill, the option now will be that these people will go to overseas sites that may be totally unregulated. So rather than achieving what the government set out to doâthat is, to protect the Australian people from both a social and economic pointâthey have failed totally. In actuality, they are driving the Australian people into an area where they have substantially less protection.

I am a fan of regulation. I do not believe prohibition works for just about anything. So if that is what Senator McGauran meant by his interjection, I will accept it. I am disappointedâand I put on record the disappointmentâthat the Senate did not choose to support a public awareness campaign. That was the amendment that people just voted againstâin case they did not know. Senator Boswell, some of the aims you sought to achieve you might have furthered through that amendment. I do not know how many people in the room have read the Netbets recommendations or have been a part of that inquiryânot too manyâbut I will say that Senator Harris certainly is aware of not only the legislation and its ill-thought-out principles but also the deficiencies in relation to this bill in actually achieving any of its aims. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âI was about to say that he was heard in silence, but then again he was not.

We will be consistent with our previous position, but I respect the right of fellow senators and my colleagues to a conscience vote on this matter. Given that, as Senator Lundy has pointed out in one of her earlier contributions, it is ironic that the intention of the government was that we would be debating gambling, but this bill is in the guise of an attack on gambling; it is actually an attack on technology.

There has been considerable discussion with the government concerning these issues and I think it is possible for us to consider all of these amendments together. It may mean that we have to make a couple of contributions but I think we will save a little time.</para><para>The opposition amendments that I have moved today are the product of that detailed discussion between us and the government. I would like to publicly acknowledge the government's cooperation in these matters and the fact that these are matters that we can now agree upon. As a consequence I think we will see a much smoother and speedier passage of the bills in total. These amendments involve constructive compromise on behalf of the opposition and the government and it is appropriate that we acknowledge that. I have no doubt they are not necessarily everything the government would like to see and they certainly are not everything we would like to see, but the result has been that this is a much stronger package of measures aimed at dealing with some very serious problems which are currently facing an extremely important component of Australia's educational industry. As senators are aware, it is one of our largest export industries and is heavily dependent upon the capacity to have a quality assurance regime in place that protects Australia's international reputation.</para><para>In essence, the key concerns that have led to this package of bills being presented to the parliament are that the present regulatory regime, for a range of reasons, is not satisfactory and there has been a failure of various authorities to ensure that quality is maintained. Our concerns, which have been voiced over a 2Â½-year campaign to see these issues attended to, were concentrated on a number of matters: the lack of sufficient tests of the bona fides of, in particular, the private colleges that were operating but also their associated agents, and concern about the relationships that were developing between some of these bogus colleges and universities and other public providers; the nature of the membership and the exemption from membership of the proposed tuition insurance scheme; perceived inadequacies in the provision relating to the services of notices by the Commonwealth to colleges that were not doing the right thing; the protection of civil liberties in this matter so that private colleges that had been accused of inappropriate behaviour would have an opportunity to address those issues through due processes of law; and the adequacy of the planned national code and the issues of the application of the bill's safeguards outside Australia and other activities. I will go through those matters.</para><para>The first issue relates to amendments Nos 1 and 2, which the opposition have moved because we feel there is a need to strengthen the arrangements in regard to the fit and proper persons test. There was quite a substantial series of colleges, and people associated with those colleges, who should never have been in the international education industry in this country. We should have had protections from those elementsâwhom I have described as criminal in partâwho have been involved with a series of unethical business ventures and who have held to ransom our reputation internationally as a result of their activities. Our concerns have been addressed through this particular measure, which will attend to the issue of people who have a record of failure in their business dealings, such as bankruptcy and fraud. This measure will weed out the providers seeking registration who have a record of dubious practices in immigration fraud or visa malpractice. Responsibility for these issues under the act will need to be taken by the Commonwealth. If this proposition is accepted by this chamber and by the House of Representatives in due course, the Commonwealth will no longer be able to say, `We can pass the buck to state authorities.' The argument is one that I feel quite strongly about. There is a need to ensure that actions are taken, and responsibility is accepted, to ensure that this sort of behaviour is prevented. Of course, it does nothing for those already in the industry, because it is not being applied retrospectively. That is another argument again. Essentially it is to start a new floor in the system. </para><para>The second amendment goes to the purpose of the national code. There has been some discussion between the government and the opposition on this issue. The opposition's concern is that the national code has to be rigorous and enforceable. It cannot in itself be another occasion when the buck-passing exercise is allowed to continue. It will include explicit reference to the conduct of persons delivering education services on behalf of registered providers, their associates, agents, employees and parties with whom they contract other relevant business relationships. It is designed to cover situations such as the case relating to an organisation known as the Australian Business Technology Institute, which was run by Mr Michael Porter, whose business collapse last year highlighted the relationship between this organisation and the University of Ballarat. Students were left high and dry, and there were serious questions concerning the loss of nearly $800,000 of company moneys. Serious questions were raised by the auditors, who said there were quite serious breaches of the Corporations Law. I can detail that later on if anyone would like to go to that matter.</para><para>The issue of the tuition assurance fund is covered under amendment No. 2, which deals with membership of assurance funds. It is designed to provide students with some protection for fees paid into a fund and, in the case of a business collapse, there is some device available to provide assistance to those students. This amendment essentially continuesâagain, by agreement with the governmentâexemptions under the existing ESOS legislation. This matter has been controversial within the industry. I have received a significant number of representations on this issue, the complaint being that public institutions ought to be covered by this tuition assurance fund. The opposition accepts the argument that has been put by the government, and it is part of the give and take of these processes, that there are far higher levels of protection for public institutions in terms of government funding which would prevent a situation whereby a public providerâa TAFE college or a universityâwould face the possibility of collapse. The view that we have taken is that that risk is minimal. As I said, this is a matter of considerable public debate within the industry. There are different views in the aerial advice being tendered as to the level of risk that has had to be borne by the 1,000 private colleges that are operating within the industry at the moment.</para><para>There are other matters that go to the servicing of notices, which is an issue we have pursued through the Senate inquiry into this bill. Our concern was to ensure that there was appropriate application of the law on a fair and reasonable basis so that colleges would not find themselves in a situation where they were alleged to be in breach of the law, with notices served on them perhaps by a junior employee of a particular college. We have a letter of comfort, if you like, from the minister which highlights that the application of the Corporations Law will apply, so that I think we can take it as reasonable and appropriate that the normal provisions of the Corporations Law would apply in that regard. I do not think it is reasonable to argue that departmental officials would be able to circumvent that arrangement. For that reason, we have not pursued anything in that area. </para><para>The last area I will deal with is the withdrawal of proposals in regard to the extraterritoriality. This issue has arisen in a range of legal areas now. It is a new area of law and is therefore subject to considerable debate. The principle has been established. In the note we received from DETYA on our proposed amendments in this area, it was acknowledged that parts of these bills will seek to apply Australian law to Australians operating overseas. That is in regard to the student visas. These are obviously provisions that have occurred already within Australian law in regard to bribery and in regard to sex crimes.</para><para>So the principle is becoming increasingly established. The issue arises as to whether or not it should apply in this bill. As I said, on the balance of the arguments we have accepted that, while this issue is yet to be resolved, we are not proceeding with it at this point. We are concerned about the enforceability and we are concerned to ensure that if any provision such as this were appliedâas we saw in the case of the Business Institute of Victoria and their disgraceful behaviour with regard to the operations out of Vanuatuâthere ought to be an application of Australian law in these circumstances. The problem is: how do you make sure it sticks? I am not interested in the empty gesture. This is a matter we will return to. It will need much more debate and careful consideration. I will need to say a bit more about the note that I have received from DETYA on thisâwhich, I must say, is less than adequate. I would have thought we would have better legal minds available on these questions than we have. I understand there is another note coming from A-G's, which I have not yet seen. I have only seen one from DETYA, which does not even address the fact that these provisions are already in law in other acts within the Australian parliament. It would be helpful if I could get that and, as I said, I will need to pursue these matters in further detail.</para><para>Finally, if we are going to introduce new sets of arrangements that concentrate solely on breaches of student visas by students, then I think we will let the team down. The overall arrangements will in fact be inadequate. What we are seeking to do is to look at the organisers of these breaches of the law. The proprietors of colleges that engage in visa scamming and criminal activity ought to be prosecuted. We ought not have the situation, which we have seen all too often in the past, of getting rid of the witnesses by merely concentrating on the students who are in breach of their visas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20835</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have no doubt that Senator Carr would be happy to elaborate on any of the points that he raised in his contribution.

The Democrats acknowledge that the government and the opposition have worked together on this legislation and have come to an agreement. I would like to thank the government for keeping us in the loop in that process. It has been good to deal with Senator Patterson, her office and her advisers, and I genuinely thank her for her keenness to keep us involved and to provide information, in particular in response to some of the concerns that I outlined on behalf of the Democrats.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the amendments before us, and I thank Senator Carr for addressing them more or less en bloc, the Democrats will be supporting the amendmentsânot completely uncritically, but we will be supporting them. We will be supporting the first amendment, incorporating the fit and proper provisions into the formal notification of registration process. We will be taking that in conjunction with amendment No. 2, the exemption of universities and bodies administered by state educational authoritiesâfor example TAFEsâfrom the fit and proper requirements. As the parliamentary secretary would know, we had some concerns about that, but the explicit provision now that any private body established by a university, such as Anutech or Melbourne University Private, is not necessarily exempt from the fit and proper considerations is an important part of that amendment, and therefore we support that element. I think the notion that those private arms not be exempt deserves unambiguous support.  </para><para>The amendment seems reasonable, given that the auditing and the governance requirements of universities could be a case of concern in relation to TAFE in states that might have poor accreditation processes, and I nominate my own state of South Australia as an example there, but pragmatically it is not an issue. We will be supporting those amendments which relate to those issues. I am referring to the exemption of TAFEs and universities from contributing to the assurance fund but not necessarily exempting any private arms such as Anutech. An amendment also exempts any other providers specifically in the regulations. As the regulations are six months away, I am not quite sure what criteria might be invoked to allow an exemption, say, for a private school, but I acknowledge the response from the parliamentary secretary's office that suggests that the government is unambiguous in making a private-public distinction. But in relation to any other providers specified in the regulations, we do not want to see that intent breached.</para><para>The amendment is supported by the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee, who are arguing that universities are sufficiently robust that they are unlikely to fail, thus endangering students' fees paid in advance. I guess, in a practical sense, the universities and the AVCC are probably right, but ACPET and other private providers obviously have concerns as they see the fund being designed to protect the whole industry. The premise that universities are robust is potentially questionable. I think we only have to look at the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee's report that was released on Friday. It demonstrates a number of things, including the need for an immediate increase of $500 million, with an additional $500 million over the next five years. So the notion that because universities are public institutions they are therefore solid and robust is, of course, questionable. It is actually questionable in light of the minister's own leaked cabinet submission, which acknowledges that eight universities are trading in deficit and some regional campuses are at risk. While there is no suggestion that any universities are in any immediate danger, without significant public reinvestment in higher education we cannot assume that they will necessarily remain financially robust.</para><para>In relation to the Labor Party's intent to make it explicit that any private provider established by or contracted by a university or TAFE is subject to the national code, the Democrats share the comments made by Senator Carr and the views of Senator Patterson that the national code should be strong and that it should be strengthened. While we know that there has been some work done behind the scenes by the states, my understanding is that there has not yet been any parliamentary or legislative action in the states on this matter in relation to the national code and that the draft protocol is still to be determined in terms of the states. So I guess we support the intent of Senator Carr's amendments. We have pointed out in correspondence to the parliamentary secretary some of the issues that we have lingering concerns over, and I think the government endeavoured to meet some of those concerns that we have outlined. Senator Carr mentioned that this is a debate that he has been involved in for a number of years, and he pointed out some of the abuses and the rorts that have gone on. I think everyone in the chamber acknowledges that those practices ought to be stamped out whether they are occurring here or overseas. I think everyone is committed to that process.</para><para>This legislation has been a long time coming. I have previously put on record our comments in relation to the sunset clause provision and, in the debate on that the last time that extension was mooted, the Democrats' concern that that was supported by Labor and the government. But I think it is high time the government made this progress. I look forward to monitoring the outcome and seeing what will happen hereon. I do not expect everyone in the industry will support all of these changes. If the government gives an undertaking or endeavours to work with them to try to sort out some of the difficulties and concerns they might have, when this legislation returns to the parliament we can re-examine it and see if there is anything else that needs to be fixed up. I have no doubt that the Senate committee process with respect to this legislation will continue, as it has done regularly for a number of years; thus giving people an opportunity to express their concerns and their views and to expose any problems that may exist with the legislation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>20837</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy comments this morning will be brief. The passage of these bills today signals the end of a lot of work in this area which was brought about by the concerns that have been raised over the years with respect to the operation of providers, what has happened to overseas students not only in this country but also overseas in relation to the take-up of courses, and in the pursuit of trying to ensure that we can guarantee quality of courses for those students who are undertaking such courses under the name of Australian education. But I do not think this should for one minute be an acceptance that this is the end of the problem. Once these bills have been passed, it should signal the start of an attempt to actually tackle some of the ongoing problems. Senator Carr is right when he mentions that some aspects will not apply retrospectively, but that does not mean you can turn a blind eye to what is happening in the industry. It lays a new groundwork and a new floor for those providers that may seek to operate in the future, but I also think it provides a good base from which to start to have a look at and to regulate what is happening. </para></talk.start><para>I think the national code needs to be enforceable and to be meaningful. It needs to be owned by those people who are operating in the industry. But, even more so, it needs to have the commitment of those people who are operating in the industry. I do welcome what I understand will be an acceptance of our amendments in relation to the registering of approved providersâthat is, to instigate a fit and proper persons test. This is of utmost importance in maintaining the quality of providers and the quality of educational services that are being delivered to students when they seek to study in this country. The amendments that we are proposing are fairly comprehensive in this area and will go a long way to satisfying our concerns about the status of these providers and their operation.</para><para>I do have a couple of questions in relation to the fund contributions and levies that I would like the parliamentary secretary to answer for me. Will the level of contributions of the annual fund be subject to regulation and therefore disallowable? Once the actual contributions criterion mentioned in clause 62 of the bill is made publicly available, does that mean that that criterion will also be subject to a disallowable instrument? If those two matters could be clarified, I would appreciate it. </para><para>Let me just say in closing that there are a number of matters still outstanding that we have concerns about in this educational sectorâfor example, the regulation of courses and the way in which they operate overseas. When I delivered my speech on this matter in the second reading debate, Senator Patterson quite rightly commented that it is very difficult to doâand it is. I think it opens up another chapter of having to look at whether it is possible, how it is possible, what can be done to try to bring about some quality assurance and regulation of providers who operate overseas under the Australian education banner and whether or not, with respect to the registration they get as training providers and the accreditation of those courses when they are delivered overseas, we can actually enforce the quality standards on those courses that we would require if they were operating on Australian soil. The other outstanding matter, of course, was the length of time it takes for students to be notified by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs with respect to their visa being withdrawn. I notice that that is not the subject of amendments today, but the way in which that is being applied to students will be monitored over the next 12 months or soâover the next coming months is probably too short a periodâand in the estimates period to see whether that is a matter we need to revisit. </para><para>I reiterate what my colleagues have said in terms of cooperation from senators in relation to these bills. There has been a lot of hard work put into these bills this year with the draft discussion paper, with the inquiry we have had in the Senate and, obviously, by people who presented submissions to the Senate inquiry. Although we are not happy with some aspects of the bills, these people certainly did indicate to us that they were quite pleased that action was being taken and that the regulation of this industry was at least being tightened and scrutinised more than it had been in the past. I will leave my comments there and wait for answers to my questions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>20838</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also want to say how much I appreciate the cooperation, but I may need a little bit more cooperation by someone asking me another question. So we can speed this along, Senator Crossin may feel moved to do that if I cannot quite answer all the questions in my given time. </para></talk.start><para>First of all I want to thank the leaders in the industry, who have spent an inordinate amount of time working with the government in a long series of consultationsâdays, in factâon some aspects of the immigration parts of these bills and some more time on the education parts. They gave up an inordinate amount of time and I just want to put on the record my appreciation and to say to their membership that they were well represented in that process. I want to also thank the members on the other side and Senator Carr in particular, who has workedâI know at a busy time of the yearâwith us to try and make sure that we could come to some arrangement and actually get these bills through. We are not always going to agree on everythingâlife is full of compromises. We have compromised and the Labor Party has compromisedânot, I think, against any moral issue, but we have been able to come to an arrangement to say, `Well, we think this is the best way to achieve what we all want to achieve.' And that is to make sure that we protect bona fide students, that we protect the reputation of the majority of providers who are offering bona fide courses and that we prevent their reputations being besmirched by the very small number of people who are less than scrupulous in this area.</para><para>I want to make some preliminary comments about the minority report which the Labor senators attached to the report by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee in respect of these bills. It recommended:</para><quote><para>The inclusion of a clause with the effect of applying procedures similar to those currently applicable under the Corporations Law to the service of documents on providers giving notice of suspension of registration.</para></quote><para>On Friday on 1 December, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, wrote to Senator Carr in respect of these concerns. I want to put a part of that letter into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the public record. It says:</para><quote><para>The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs lawyers have advised as follows: If the provider is a company, the department will only be able to serve the notice on the company giving notice of suspension of registration by relying on s109x of the Corporations Law. That section sets out procedures for serving documents on a company for the purposes of any law (s109x of the Corporations Law) and, therefore, it would be unnecessary duplication to repeat the provisions of section 109x in the ESOS bills.</para></quote><para>Before I turn to the amendments, I should not forget to thank the officers of both departments who have had to work across departments and also to thank my staff, the Democrats' staff and Senator Carr's staff, because they have been on the phone, backwards and forwards, about the amendments. It has been an example of what you can do behind the scenes if there is cooperation.</para><para>The amendments that Senator Carr has introduced were, in the government's view, I have to say, unnecessary, because they would have been covered by the government's provisions in the deal on the national code. Senator Carr said that he was moving the amendments because there should be a fit and proper person test. We agree there should be a fit and proper person test. There was no disagreement on that: the disagreement was on where it should be put. Senator Carr felt it should be in the legislation; we felt that it was covered in the national code, which is a disallowable instrument. But in the interests of getting the bills through, and to compromise, we have agreed that it would go in the legislation.  </para><para>The government has agreed to these amendments, notwithstanding our view that they would have been better dealt with in the code following a proper consultation with the states and territories. We had agreed to consult with the states and territories about these issues and the code. So I put on the public record that that has been pre-empted a bit by having to move this into the legislation. </para><para>The fit and proper person test amendment which Senator Carr is proposing is the amendment to include in the ESOS bill a provision that the state designated authorities will advise DETYA that the provider has satisfied them that the provider is fit and proper to be registered. We had already, as I said, proposed such a provision for the national code, which will contain the rules regarding registration on CRICOS. The national code gives the rules for states, which will continue to approve providers for registration on the Commonwealth register. The national code also gives the rules for providers to comply with. The bill gives the legal framework for Commonwealth action and the legal basis for enforceability of the code. It would have been more sensible to include a fit and proper person test in the code along with the other requirements for registration on CRICOS, including the provider's history, arrangements with other providers and who can be registered on CRICOS. The government would have preferred to continue to negotiate this provision with the states in the process of finalising the provisions of the national code. It is a matter of regret, because the states will have the key role in applying the test, but we could not justify delaying these important reforms. So we will be agreeing with these amendments.</para><para>With regard to the assurance fund exemptions, Senator Carr is introducing an amendment to incorporate in the bill exemptions from the requirement to belong to the assurance fund. The bill did not have a provision to place these exemptions in the regulations in the same way that the 1991 act provided exemptions in the regulations of the NTA requirements. Senator Carr has chosen to cut short the consultation which was in hand on this aspect in the regulations, and he has introduced an amendment into the chamber to achieve a purpose which could have been achieved through the regulations. Again, it was not something over which we thought we could justify delaying the bill, so we will agree to that amendment as well. The government also agrees with the purpose of national code amendment No. 4.</para><para>With respect to the questionsâand I have bits of notes all over the place hereâthere was one point that Senator Stott Despoja made that I was not quite sure about. I think she mentioned that a private arm of a publicly funded provider did not have to go through the fit and proper test. I may be misrepresenting her here but, in case she did say that, I will clarify it: that is not the case. If she did not say that, I apologise to her. She has had to leave the chamber; she excused herself and told me she had something else on. Just to clarify that point, private arms of publicly funded providers do have to go through a fit and proper test.</para><para>Senator Carr referred to the issue of extraterritoriality, as did Senator Crossin, and Senator Carr mentioned it was an issue of discussion. Because of both the government's desire and the desire of those on the other side to ensure that we move as quickly as possible on these bills, we have decided that is an issue that needs to be continued in debate. But, with regard to extraterritoriality, in the minority report the Labor senators argued that the bill should be amended at an early stage to provide for extraterritoriality. As I said, I am grateful for their recognition that this is a complex matter which we cannot address today, but there are some complications and policy implications in such a proposal. </para><para>We gave Senator Carr a briefing note from the department of education on this issue, and we did say that we would approach A-G's. Attorney-General's advice was sought and incorporated into the DETYA brief. I do not know if Senator Carr actually heard me, because this was an issue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âSorry?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âThe advice from Attorney-General's was sought and incorporated into the DETYA brief. Because of the time available today I will not go through the issues of extraterritoriality, but there are some problems. We have control by being able to issue visas here in Australia and now being able to stop visas being issued. But there is a problem in that you do not have that power if a student is studying in an institution overseas. There are some implications about how you inspect, how you monitor and how you enforce your authority in an overseas country. They are all issues that need to be debated and worked through, because I think they have a lot of implications and a lot of problems associated with them. So that is a debate for another day, but obviously those are of concern to people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other issue that Senator Crossin referred to was the 28 days that students have from when they are told they need to present themselves to explain why they have not been complying with their course requirements. Senator Crossin, I taught for over 15 years in tertiary institutions and I know that students are peripatetic, that they float around and that not even their families sometimes know where they happen to be living at the time as they move from one place to another. But we have required that the students advise the institutions where they areâand that is one of the requirements of their visaâso that we can actually expect that we can issue information to them to tell them that they have been seen to be in breach of their visa conditions.</para><para>It was my idea that it be 28 days. In the consultations, some people wanted it to be much shorter, and I said that students had Easter holidays and other holidays, so I was pushing for slightly longer. I have to say to you that it was my suggestion that it be a bit longer. We will test it and see. Hopefully, the students will be counselled beforehand that they are heading towards breaching their visa conditions. It is unlikely that they would be in breach of their visa conditions over a long holiday because they would actually be on holidays. We are hoping the 28 days will work. </para><para>We have put in place that they need to let the provider know where they are. We will have an automatic form that will go out to facilitate things for the provider so that it is a quick turnaround. We have done everything to ensure that it is not too onerous. But there are some people who are on the edges of the industryâthe people we have been concerned aboutâwho will use every single opportunity they can to extend a non-bona fide student's time here so that they can continue working, and they use student visas for purposes other than for bona fide students. </para><para>We have to get a balance between the bona fide student who for some reason is not complying with their course requirementsâif a student is ill or in hospital and they have a reasonable excuse for not complying with their course requirements, that will be coveredâand other people who will try to abuse the system. Hopefully we have struck that balance; it is something that ought to be monitored. Getting the right balance is something that I am very cognisant of and concerned about. I understand your concern as it was a concern for me as well, but we have put in 28 days and we will monitor closely how that works. Senator Crossin and Senator Carr said that there was a new floor for providers. Yes, there is a new floor, a new test, for providers, but if the current providers breach the act or the code they are out. The senator said it was not retrospective, but if providers breach the code or the act they are out, and we have extensive new powers of monitoring and searching.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âIt is for future action.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âFor future action, yes. We are not going back to register people but there are new powers. So there is a new test for people coming in, but we also have more extensive powers to actually check the providers. Senator Carr says that he has been pushing this issue for 2Â½ years. I have to say, Senator Carr, that it has concerned me since I have been parliamentary secretary. As you know, these things take a long while by the time you do the consultation. But it is something that really needed to be done, since about 1991 or 1992âthe early 1990s, anyway. I know that it is something that the industry has wanted. There are a number of people who are very keen to see this legislation in place, and it is a very important thing we have done by cooperating, by consultation and by what I think has been a very good process. It is just a shame the publicâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>20841</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are some other matters I do need to canvass on this. Senator McGauran's comments were, as usual, of the imbecilic type. I have indicated before that he is a perfect example of the old adage about brains and a statue, and he keeps demonstrating that whenever he opens his mouth. I have been asked to raise some matters in regard to the response of the department to some of these concerns that have been pursued. </para></talk.start><para>The latest example I have of this issue is a letter that was sent by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Ms Trish Worth, dated 22 November, to Mrs Julia Irwin, who raised some concerns in the House of Representatives about a particular provider college and the complaints she had received from one of her constituents. As a result, a letter was sent by DETYA to her asking her for further and better particulars. In itself that is no particular issue, but this is a letter which is obviously from the same template as one that I received in October last year from the minister, with similar paragraphs and the like. Essentially, the concern that is being raised here is that the Commonwealth department of education appear to maintain a strong tendency to relapse on these matters. They go through a phase where they acknowledge how serious the problem is but occasionally relapse into a condition of denial. They raise justifications, if you like, with anyone who makes complaints, particularly members of parliament, and seek further details of any issue raised, in a manner which I think most members would see as a little unsettling. </para><para>I received a letter in similar terms from the minister last year, as I said. Basically I might describe it as a `put up or shut up' letter. It has exactly the opposite effect on me, because it suggests that I am being asked to go back into the chamber and explain the detail of the allegations that are being raised, in a manner which I think affords a full public airing of these concerns. No sooner is a letter like this and the one in October received than it is usually followed up, if you are silly enough to reply to it, by an FOI request by the colleges that are named, the providers that are named, in these matters. The FOI request is then responded to by the government, and that subjects the member of parliament, I suggest, to judicial action.</para><para>We are not covered by parliamentary privilege in correspondence to the minister. Members should be aware of this, because that is exactly the situation that occurred in my case. When I responded to the minister, an FOI application was put in. In this particular instance, the circumstances concern Skywell College in Sydney, which has, as I have said before, a new college open in Melbourne, and the New South Wales Business College, an English college. Black Ace College was another. It is alleged that these places were effectively vehicles for the mobilisation of visa scams and that the scams involved Indian students who were working full time and were subcontracted out on a commission basis to work for various dubious employers. Other employers who may not be dubious are duped into employing people effectively illegally. I will deal with the particulars of that in the next bill. I wanted to raised this wider issue in this context because I think it is important that I voice my concerns, especially where ministers and parliamentary secretaries are signing off letters provided by the department without sufficient thought to the basis on which such correspondence is being sent and perhaps the consequences of correspondence being sent. If the member were silly enough to reply in terms detailing the allegations, that would then expose them to action in the courts outside the provisions of parliamentary privilege.  </para><para>It is important also to state my concern in regard to a recent strategic audit undertaken in Victoria under the Vocational Education and Training Act of a series of 20 providers providing services to international students. Not one was fully compliant. This information in the report to the Office of Post-compulsory Education and Training of 21 September, prepared by Rob Gullan and Andrea Bateman, highlighted the gross deficiencies of the system. We have a government now in Victoria that is actually serious about doing something about it. This is one year after it took office, and the report refers to the activities of 20 providers in Victoria in a period prior to when the government took office.</para><para>I raise the issue that, as it says in this report, there are endemic problems. I will quote directly:</para><quote><para>The inaccuracy of qualifications and particularly statements of attainment across providers is endemic. </para></quote><para>The issues relate to: </para><quote><para>... inaccuracies of nomenclature, incorrect titles, non-existent in terms of curriculum modules and units, incorrect award structures ... In the latter case, qualifications were being awarded by providers where students have not successfully concluded all necessary modules as specified in curriculum documents. </para></quote><para>There are serious problems with student welfare. There are very serious problems with regard to quality assurance. It says, for instance, in this report:</para><quote><para>Where a quality assurance process does exist, it is often more focused on improvements in operational systems and customer service than on the educational assessment or the recognition of prior learning issues.</para></quote><para>So there are quite serious issues yet to be addressed by states and this is why I am concerned to make sure the code is actually enforced and is enforceable. It is simply no good to maintain this fiction that it is a responsibility for the states and that if there are any problems it is because the states have to act alone. The Commonwealth has responsibilities in this regard as well.</para><para>What I am particularly concerned about are the reports on the CRICOS listing. It says here that the basis of the audited CRICOS listing and accuracy of the report are paramount. The CRICOS listingâthat is, the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Studentsâas we know is supposed to include information about the number of students, the course code, the course names, the fees and the duration of the course. The report says:</para><quote><para>It would seem, however, that information on CRICOS listing is often inaccurate, at best inconsistent, and regularly appears to display differences of interpretation of criteria by people responsible for entering the data.</para></quote><para>For example, it is not clear as to the meaning of the number of students specified on the CRICOS listing. That is a pretty fundamental issue, I would have thought, given the relationship between visas and the question of where students are actually studying. This is supposed to be the main registration body for the Commonwealth. It is a Commonwealth responsibility. It is clear that those interpretations are varied and lead to quite misleading information. It says, for instance:</para><quote><para>Interpretations include the number of international students able to attend per shift, the number of international students able to enrol, the number of students domestic and international able to be enrolled ...</para></quote><para>It says in respect of the course codes:</para><quote><para>It is often difficult to determine which course is on the CRICOS listing or which curriculum document is applicable. The course name is often inconsistently abbreviated, truncatedâ</para></quote><para>and so on. There are a range of abuses occurring within the existing arrangements of the Commonwealth registration lists which ought to be attended to in any process. This is not just a case of me making allegations. I would put to the Senate that the allegations I have made over the last 2Â½ years have been very widely supported, even though the department has not always had the capacity to prosecute. I do not think that there has been serious issue on the question of the accuracy of the issues that have been raised. Here we have an audit undertaken by a state government highlighting the concerns about the regime, which I am afraid is not really attended to in this particular legislation. We are making an assumption in this legislation that the CRICOS listing is an accurate and effective means of providing a registration process. It is clearly an assumption that needs to be tested. So, Parliamentary Secretary, these are concerns that still need to be attended to. Administrative arrangements would require the Commonwealth to take responsibility. </para><para>Finally, on the issue of the franchisingâthat is, where institutions use CRICOS listing as a vehicle by which to attract studentsâit is critical that that be policed effectively and that the arrangements be enforced effectively, because the reputation of Australian institutions internationally is dependent upon the capacity to provide quality assurance in terms of the qualifications of graduates coming out of these colleges. If the situation that we have seen, for instance, at the Wesley Institute in Sydney, is any exampleâor the case of the ABTI and Ballarat University or a number of others I could go toâthis suggests to me that in terms of the current arrangements, as far as the Commonwealth's responsibilities are concerned, there is considerable work yet to be done by the department of education in these matters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>20843</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI might just use this opportunity to remind the parliamentary secretary of a number of questions I raised regarding the matter of the fund: the amount of contributions to be set in the annual fund and the contributions criteria, and whether those two elements will be included in the regulations and subject to a disallowable instrument.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>20843</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I was saying when the clock interrupted me, it is just a shame sometimes that the public does not see this sort of debateâdespite the fact that Senator Carr and I disagreed even within the debateâand this sort of reasonable cooperation to achieve an outcome. I will answerSenator Crossin's question about the contributions. The contributions criteria will be determined by the contributions review panel, which will have an industry expert representative on the advice of the fund manager. It will not be disallowable and it will not be in the regulations; it will be developed on the basis of risk assessed, commercially assessed and actuarial predictions being taken into account. No, I do not know the answer to how that will then be controlled, but I presume the contributions review panel will set down the guidelines. The question Senator Crossin is really asking is: how is that going to be enforced or maintained? I will need some advice on that. </para></talk.start><para>I will just go back to Senator Carr's comments about the issue of the CRICOS registration. As he is aware, this is not an area of my responsibility, nor are the other issues that he has raised. I will draw Minister Kemp's attention and Parliamentary Secretary Trish Worth's attention to the comments he has made. I have to say, though, that we inherited a system that needed a lot of renovation. I was somewhat shocked that visas could be issued without our knowing how many we had issued for a particular college or provider. There are some problems with that. We are now setting up a system. It is quite difficult to get all the IT developed and in place, but we are working towards it. The department of immigration will know to which colleges or providers we have issued visas. In the past, when a student appeared and applied for a visa, with a confirmation of enrolment from a CRICOS registered college or provider they would get the visa. They could have been registered for 150 students and we might have given out hundreds of visas. We inherited that system. That was totally unacceptable. We are now working towards knowing how many are issued.</para><para>We have a problem with overlap, and this is one of the problems the states have in monitoring. I was talking to one of the monitors the other day at a function and they said that it is quite difficult. They may be registered for 200 students, but, as Senator Carr said, they have shifts: they have students who are coming and students who are just leaving. You cannot say, `You are registered for 200 students and we are only going to let you have visas for 200 students,' because some students are finishing their courses and they have a period in which they prepare to leave Australia. But it still gives us an idea if there are scams going on. </para><para>However, I will draw Minister Kemp's and Parliamentary Secretary Trish Worth's attention to the comments that have been made. I have to say, though, that as part of the consultation process we had meetings with the people responsible in the various states. We started those meetings over a year ago. I attended, I think, two of themâone for the whole sessionâand we talked about the issues, the concerns, the problems. I think that was the first time it had been done. We pointed out to the states the concerns that we hadâfrom my point of view, about immigrationâand that was an enlightening experience for all of us. So there has been a lot more cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth on these issues than I think has occurred in the past. We are more aware of the problems that they have in monitoring and they are more aware of the issues that concern us. It is not just a case of saying, `We will pass it off to the states.' One of the reasons that we have had to bring these measures in is that, if a state is not really up to scratch in monitoring, it does give us more powers at the Commonwealth level to do something about it. I will draw those comments to the minister's attention and to the attention of Ms Worth.</para><para>Senator Crossin referred to the assurance fund contribution. The bill says that the contributions review panel will determine the contributions criteria. The panel will have five industry members and five others, including people with expertise in financial services and fund management, and all the panel and fund managers will be bound by the purpose of the fund and the fund's purpose is to protect the interests of overseas students.

They are necessary, on the advice of the department, in response to the decision of the Federal Court in the recent case of Nong v. the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs of 6 November 2000. The issues go to the effect of this decision on the current arrangements in regard to an 80 per cent attendance requirement for students who are engaged in the education industry in the non-exempt provider category. On my reading of the advice tendered to us, if this position is carried forward you will see a fundamental pillar of the regulatory regime in regard to students visas being seriously undermined. The effect of the judgment, in terms of the advice tendered to me, is that an action cannot be taken until the end of a course if a student is in fact in breach, or alleged to be in breach, of the 80 per cent attendance requirement. Clearly, this would have very serious implications for those who wish to engage in fraudulent activity in regard to the education program.</para></talk.start><para>The concern that we have expressed about this goes essentially to the current arrangements. It is our view that the 80 per cent attendance requirement ought to be enforced on a periodic basisâthat is, over the duration of the course the student has undertakenârather than at the end. The situation may well arise that if a bogus provider was able to enrol students for a three-year program and not have their attendance checked until the end of the three-year period, persons could in fact be working illegally, undermining the wages and conditions of other workers in this countryâa situation which we see all too commonly at the moment. Illegal workers are often placed in the most dangerous and vulnerable of circumstances and are not able to afford themselves the appropriate protection through trade union activity or to ensure that their wages and conditions are enforced at law, so they are obliged to take up the most menial of arrangements. We have seen this in the case of brothels, in the taxi industry, in security, in the restaurant trade and in the building industry. </para><para>My concern has been that the government actually does something about illegal workers in the sense that it looks at the persons who are organising these scams, at the employers who are engaging in these activities, and does not concentrate on removing the witnesses, if you like, to these crimes. As a result of issues that we pursued through the Senate estimates we had confirmation that Chubb Security, for instance, had 88 students working illegally on the city railway stations who were asked to leave. In the restaurant trade, in the hospitality industry and particularly in the building industry persons are used as low wage workers and are not able to defend themselves in those circumstances. In a college in Sydney with overseas students only six out of the 41 students were actually fulfilling their obligations under the visa. Six out of 41 were turning up to school. This program is about education, not about encouraging people to come here to work under the most appalling conditions. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>20846</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the opposition for its indication that it will support the amendments. The explanatory memorandum outlines the intention of the amendments. Condition 8202, which we thought applied, was intended to enable the progressive assessment of a student's attendance and academic performance. As Senator Carr said, somebody could come in on a bogus three-year course and work here illegally. Where satisfactory attendance and academic performance were not maintained, condition 8202 was intended to provide a ground for the cancellation of students' visas at any time during the course. It was not intended that you had to wait until they had completed the whole course, which could be a three-year course. </para></talk.start><para>The amendments to the bill will impose a new version of the condition 8202 on student visas. This version will allow a student's compliance with condition 8202 to be assessed during their course. There are 138,000 student visa holders in Australia who have condition 8202 imposed on their visas. According to the Federal Court's decision in Nong, it is not possible to take action against any of these 138,000 student visa holders who are not attending classes until the end of their course. </para><para>Finally, the amendments to the bill also introduce a new ground for the cancellation of a student visa under section 116 of the Migration Act 1958. This new power will permit the cancellation of a student visa where the holder is not, or is not likely to be, a genuine student or the holder has engaged in, or will engage in, conduct not contemplated by the visa. This will further promote the integrity of the overseas visa program, which all of us in this chamber are attempting to do. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

As I read it, subitem (3), under part 4, includes a condition that requires the holder of the visa to achieve an academic result that is certified to be at least `satisfactory' by the education provider for each semester. I want to ascertain whether, when you put that section together with subitem (6), it empowers the minister to cancel a visa simply if a student has a bad semester, or an unsatisfactory performance in that one semester. Does this now provide the minister with that power? Obviously, it is not automatic that he will do that, but does it give him that power solely on that basis? Is that correct?  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>20847</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI stand to be corrected, but I believe it is if the provider indicates that the student has not satisfactorily completed the course.

But is it also the case that, even if they perform unsatisfactorily for one semesterâand this is in terms of their academic result; this is not in terms of attendanceâif they fail a few subjects, that will then empower the minister to cancel their visa? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>20847</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is not an automatic cancellation of a visa.

In federating, the sovereign states ceded certain powers to the Commonwealth under five distinct headings and all other powers were to remain the prerogative of the states. This was in contrast to Canada where the Canadian Union was formed with the provinces having defined powers and all other powers remaining with the central government. As we approach the Centenary of Federation, I think it is interesting to consider the question of changes in sovereignty between the states themselves and in comparison with the rise in power and sovereignty of the federal government in our Australian federation. Within any federation there are tensions between the state and federal parliaments over the sovereignty and powers each possess. Bickering among levels of government over the intrusion of one level into a sphere that the other level regards as its own is very common in federations. One of the interesting dimensions to the recent American election has been the public displayâas it is not often displayedâof differences in the sovereignty between the federal and the state governments. There we saw that the conduct of the elections, even in the federal sphere, is very much a role for the states. </para></talk.start><para>In Australia, we have seen tensions between the state and federal governmentsâas occurs in all federations. Over the decades since Federation, we have witnessed a shift in the balance of power between the central government and the states, with an increase in the authority and power of the federal parliament at the expense of the states. The federal parliament has been seen in some quarters as intruding into areas which have generally been thought to be the primary responsibility of the states. There have been two main factors in this intrusion of Commonwealth power into state areas of responsibility: vertical fiscal imbalance and the interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court. The way in which the financial affairs of our federation have worked in recent years have been very much characterised by a high degree of vertical fiscal imbalance. This has occurred to a greater degree than in any other federation in the world. In fact, the states are responsible for around 45 per cent of total public expenditure, yet raise 20 per cent of the national taxation revenue; whereas the Commonwealth is responsible for around 50 per cent of public sector expenditure, but raises over 75 per cent of taxation revenues. This situation has arisen as a result of the states ceding power for taxation to the Commonwealth during the Second World War. Since then the Commonwealthâsome say by playing off the large states against the smaller ones, and vice versaâhas retained power over taxation and finance and, thus, increased its power and primacy within the federation. </para><para>It is interesting that in other countries the taxation powers of the federal government are fairly limited. For instance, citizens of the United States still pay quite substantial state taxes as well as local taxes for local government. The power over finance has given the Commonwealth a higher degree of leverage over the states than occurs, as I said, in almost any other federation in the world. Because of its power over finance, the Commonwealth has been able to wring concessions out of the states with the enticement of more money for given projects. Also, section 96 of the Constitution permits the Commonwealth to extend tied grants to the states, with specific terms and conditions in areas such as education and health where the Commonwealth has no specific powers. Vertical fiscal imbalance has helped the Commonwealth establish its dominance even in policy areas where it appeared to have no direct power, according to David Solomon in his work <inline font-style="italic">Coming of age: charter for a new Australia</inline>.</para><para>The Howard government's guarantee that all the GST revenue under the new taxation system will go to the states goes a long way to redressing the imbalance that has occurred over the years. It will give the states an independent revenue stream which they themselves can decide how to spend on projects within their own states. It will also reduce the dependence of the states and state premiers in pleading for money from the Commonwealth for various projects. That must be seen as a step which, as I said, does something to reduce the imbalance that has occurred between the Commonwealth and the states over financial matters. </para><para>One of the key institutions that has tended to grant more power to the Commonwealth at the expense of the states has been the High Court. Its judgments in general have had the effect of altering the balance of power between the central government and the states and have tended to increase the power of the Commonwealth at the expense of the states. Naturally, in some states, such as Western Australia, where I come from, there have been long discussions about the role of the High Court and the fact that the court has tended to favour the Commonwealth in its judgments. It is not uncommon in Western Australia to hear discussion of the need for reform of the High Court, perhaps limiting its powers in some respects and certainly considering a different method of appointing the judges so that there is a greater representation from the small states than has been the case so far in the history of the court.</para><para>In developing judgments which have tended to favour the Commonwealth, the High Court has used, certainly in recent years, the external affairs power of the Constitution as a means of extending the power of the Commonwealth. In this way, it has extended the interests of the Commonwealth into areas which the founding fathers of the Constitution a hundred years ago could not possibly have envisaged. The external affairs power can be used by the Commonwealth to give it `power to legislate on matters which would otherwise be state responsibilities if this gives effect to international agreements', according to John Summers, in `Federalism and Commonwealth-State Relations' in <inline font-style="italic">Government Politics, Power and Policy in Australia</inline>. In the famous Tasmanian dam case in 1983, the High Court interpreted the external affairs powers of the Commonwealth expansively. In a string of subsequent decisions, the High Court affirmed and re-affirmed an extremely wide interpretation of the external affairs power which enables the Commonwealth to pass laws implementing treaties regardless of their subject matter or whether they intrude deeply into traditional state jurisdiction. Also in the Tasmanian dam case, Justice Mason concluded: </para><quote><para>... there are virtually no limits to the topics which may hereafter become the subject of international cooperation and international treaties or conventions. </para></quote><para>In the same case, Justice Brennan said:</para><quote><para>The position of the Commonwealth ... has waxed; and that of the states has waned. </para></quote><para>The ALP, when it was in office for 13 years, facilitated this by entering into a raft of treaties at a rate between 30 and 50 per year, usually without any consultation with the states or the Commonwealth parliament. Those treaties provide a very fertile ground for the High Court to make judgments extending the power of the Commonwealth.</para><para>In the last year or so, the tendency of the federal parliament, through its own power, to seek to meddle in the affairs of the states has been exemplified by issues to do with native title and mandatory sentencing. Land and resource management is very much a primary responsibility of the states, yet we have found, under the amended native title legislation, that the state regimes that were provided for under section 43A of the Commonwealth Native Title Act have been subject to disallowance by the Senate. We have seen, in fact, that the WA and Northern Territory native title regimes have been disallowed and that the Queensland regime of native title legislation has been significantly amended by the Senate, again reducing the sovereignty of the states in terms of their own right to manage matters to do with land in their own jurisdictions. </para><para>Mandatory sentencing, which was an issue earlier this year, is another example where members of the federal parliament expressed a strong desire to interfere in what were seen to be areas of state responsibility in terms of management of criminal law matters. The fact that the proposed laws providing for interference in the state jurisdictions in criminal law were not passed by the federal government does not take away from the fact that the federal parliament sought to interfere within the state criminal law jurisdiction. It underlines the fact that there is now a different view of the importance of and respect for the sovereignty of the states in those areas which, a hundred years ago, it was agreed should be the responsibility of the states alone, with the Commonwealth being confined to the matters of interest that were listed in the Constitution. </para><para>There is a different attitude, and I think it is fair to say in general terms that there has been a view that the sovereignty of the states is far less important than it was a hundred years ago. We have to ask ourselves whether that is really a good thing and whether it is in the interests of the good government of Australia. One would have to say that, certainly in Western Australia, there is a view that the states do have a very important and ongoing role to play in our federation and that there are very legitimate reasons for the respect of state sovereignty in the areas which, under the Constitution of a hundred years ago, it was agreed should be the areas of jurisdiction of the states.</para><para>For one thing, it is useful to have the opportunity for different states to take innovative approaches to problems which might be common throughout Australia. It can be argued very strongly that the capacity for flexibility and innovation given by the retention of power in various areas by the states is very important and very useful to the Australian people. It can also be argued that state governments are closer to the people whom they govern and that state governments thereby can make laws more appropriate to the individual needs of the individual states. That, too, is a very powerful argument. But there is a more powerful argument in terms of respecting the sovereignty of the states, and that is that the states act as regional watchdogs for the interests of their jurisdictions. It is often forgotten how big and vast a country Australia is and how different the regions of this country are. Were there not state governments with power and sovereignty, it would be very much the case that the Commonwealth would override the interests of the more remote areas of Australia and govern very largely for the areas where the people are located according to the number of federal voters in various electorates; states like Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland would be disadvantaged if the regional governmentsâthat is, the state governmentsâwere not preserved in the coming years.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>AIDS Awareness and Prevention</title><page.no>20850</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>20850</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to address the Senate on the efforts of the Queensland AIDS Council in holding the World AIDS Day Fair at the Pier Market Place in Cairns last Friday, 1 December.

As my colleague Senator Denman acknowledged in this place last Friday, the adoption of this particular theme is not a statement of gender disempowerment on behalf of women. In fact, the theme of `men make a difference' recognises that in many cultures around the globe, the power relationships inherent in relationships dictate that men must take more responsibility for their behaviour, particularly if they engage in extramarital sex.</para><para>I would also like to emphasise that the theme of this year's World AIDS Day is not directed specifically towards homosexual males for that matter either. AIDS awareness is not confined within certain national borders or segments of particular communities, socioeconomic or otherwise. It is incumbent upon all of us to do what we can. That being so, on this occasion, the AIDS Council has simply sought to highlight the dominant role men play in sexual relationships and, in turn, the effort they can and should make to make a difference. That is what it is really all about.</para><para>AIDS presents a huge cost to the community, not just in economic terms. The impact of AIDS on the family unit and within the community as a whole is of serious concern. That is why the efforts of those who work tirelessly to both create awareness and acceptance of AIDS as well as its prevention are so important. In discussing the importance of prevention, it should be recognised that Australia has enjoyed an exemplary record in the fight against the spread of AIDS. The response of public health authorities during Labor's term in government has been hailed as one of the best in the world. That was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> on 2 July 2000. Education campaigns, safe sex messages and needle exchanges have seen the number of HIV diagnoses fall in this country from a peak of 1,276 cases in 1990 to 663 in 1998. The implementation of this campaign has meant that predictions that nationally 65,000 Australians would have contracted HIV by the mid-1990s were not borne out. Perhaps as a result of this success, there seems to be a new era of complacency in AIDS awareness and prevention by government. It has been recently reported that some young men are suffering from safe sex fatigue and that the rate of HIV diagnoses has been increasing in recent times. This should serve as a timely reminder to government that the fight against AIDS is not over yet; in fact, far from it. Complacency through reduced awareness and a reduction in funding for prevention programs could be disastrous. Given this, it is disturbing, to say the least, that in more recent times the Commonwealth government has removed key conditions of HIV-AIDS funding that were previously in place.</para><para>Whereas the Commonwealth once dictated in providing funding that half the money be spent on HIV prevention education programs and, secondly, that the states match Commonwealth funding on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the government no longer has these conditions in place. As recognised in the federal government's own national HIV-AIDS strategy of 1999, the toll on the community as a result of AIDS has been far from minimal. On the government's own figures, approximately 5,700 Australians have died and a further 16,700 are living with chronic HIV infection. Those rates are far too high.</para><para>In monetary terms it has been estimated that the cost of treatment and care of HIV infection is in excess of $130 million, not to mention the social cost. Yet despite this, the accountability requirements for the spending of Commonwealth allocated HIV-AIDS funding have been reduced to alarmingly loose levels by the Commonwealth government. The government cannot afford to shy away from its commitment towards promoting AIDS awareness and methods of prevention. This includes prevention education campaigns and assistance given to those such as the AIDS Council. Indeed, as Tony Keenan of the Victorian Ministerial Advisory Committee on Gay and Lesbian Health indicated in the<inline font-style="italic"> Age</inline> on 16 October 2000: </para><quote><para>... complacency and neglect were always going to be the greatest threats to HIV prevention ... I for one will not accept another AIDS death simply because we did nothing.</para></quote><para>Moreover, whilst the continued awareness and prevention of HIV-AIDS are of importance at the national level, it would be remiss of us to ignore our international obligations in the war against AIDS. It is an absolute travesty that, where countries cannot afford public education campaigns or where governments have disallowed the broadcast of safe sex messages, HIV-AIDS has continued to rise dramatically. From a global perspective the statistics paint a frightening picture of the state of affairs. By the end of 1998 there were 33.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS, representing a 10 per cent increase on the figure for 1997. In 1998, 5.8 million new infections were reported, translating to 16,000 new infections a day or 11 every minute. In the same year 2.5 million people died from HIV-AIDS related illnesses. Even more disturbing, however, are reports that at least 2.7 million people aged between 15 and 21 became infected with the virus, as well as over four million infants and children under the age of 15 years, according to the World Health Organisation in 1998.</para><para>The United Nations has suggested that the world has never before experienced death rates of this magnitude amongst young adults of both sexes across all social strata. Statistical data from many Asian countries is becoming of increasing concern, but the pandemic in Africa continues to demonstrate the devastating effect of what AIDS can do if left unchecked. In countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, for example, where at least 20 per cent of adults are HIV infected, AIDS will kill about half of those who are currently 15 years old.</para><para>In concluding, I would like to reiterate the importance of maintaining a commitment to promoting HIV-AIDS awareness in the community and continuing to fight against its spread. This will involve continued support to the scientific community in funding important research programs into developing AIDS vaccines and ultimately a cure. Indeed Australia boasts many talented and hardworking scientists who are striving to make progress in this field. In addition to research funding, however, the importance of prevention is paramount and the government must improve and maintain its support in the implementation of prevention education programs. The AIDS epidemic may have been limited in the extent of its impact in the community, but its impact has still been substantial. I applaud the efforts of those who seek to turn around this epidemic and make a difference. I, along with my colleagues, will continue to support the efforts of the Queensland AIDS Council and the World AIDS Day Fair to that end, as every bit helpsâwe can all make a difference.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 24-hour Stop-work Meeting</title><page.no>20852</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>20852</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak today on a matter of great public interest, and that is the 24 hour stop-work meeting by ABC staff which is being held today.

I am angry about the removal of <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline> presenter Paul Barry; I am concerned about the axing of the science unit, and I am worried about rumours that other specialists and overseas programs and bureaus are for the axe.

I want to send a message to those who are causing the disruption, damage and, yes, vandalism of the national broadcaster.

My Liberal colleague from Western Australia Senator Eggleston has also spoken on the subject of Federation today but I think in slightly different terms from that which I am planning to pursue. </para><para>In relation to Federation and the system that was established at the time, as is typical with a new system in its infancy there were a few glitches to be worked through at the commencement of our newly federated Australia. After all of the politicking that was used to form the nation, it is not entirely surprising that there was not a smooth passage for the taking up of office of the first Prime Minister. For example, in late December 1900 one of the first tasks of the newly appointed Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, who was the seventh Earl of Hopetoun and Lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria, was to appoint the first Commonwealth ministry. It would appear that he may have been poorly advised and offered the then New South Wales Premier, Sir William Lyne, an opponent of Federation, the commission to form government. However, this decision turned out to be a particularly unpopular one. After much correspondence, predominantly on the part of Alfred Deakin, Edmund Barton became Australia's first Prime Minister and Lyne was appointed Minister for Home Affairs. </para><para>I think it is important to note that, even before the first Prime Minister took office, Australians were `doing things our way'âwe were not going to be dictated to by people beyond our shores. Lyne, who was, as I said, an adamant supporter of the no vote for Federation and who appeared never to have been too far from controversy, found himself in another fracas preceding Federation. So in some ways elements of Australia's larrikin psyche were beginning to emerge in a way that differentiated us from the rest of the world.</para><para>The political commentary of the time displayed the robust and often personal perspective with which I suspect we are all too well accustomed these days. In the public debates many people came to realise that Federation would bring cheaper prices for various goods and services as a result of Australian intrastate free trade. So the price of goods and services was as much an issue then as it is now. One of the speakers at a league meeting was quoted as saying:</para><quote><para>Gentlemenâ</para></quote><para>and they wereâ</para><quote><para>if you vote for the Bill you will found a great and glorious nation under the bright Southern Cross, and meat will be cheaper; and you will live to see the Australian race dominate the Southern seas, and you'll have a market for both potatoes and apples; and your sons shall reap the grand heritage of nationhood; and if Sir William Lyne does not come back to power in Sydney he can do you one pennyworth of harm.</para></quote><para>Of course that leaves one wondering what the daughters were going to reap. </para><para>At the turn of the century, Australia had a population of 3.8 million and the income per head was amongst the highest in the world. So this world-envied level resulted in us enjoying a high standard of living and of course the reputation of Australia's economy `riding on the sheep's back'. But it was not long until tough decisions had to be made and troubles in Europe brought us into World War I. This was another defining step in our post-Federation development. Our forces may well have been commanded by the English but there were a couple of issues on which we were simply not prepared to be dictated to. Australian soldiers had developed somewhat of a larrikin reputation during the Boer War. By World War I the Australian government had instituted a policy that enabled the execution of Australian troops to be performed only under the express permission of the Australian Governor-General and not the English command, as had been the case in the Boer Warâa scene that will be familiar to many of us from film in particular.</para><para>The second issue on which the Australian government stood firm was that no Australian units would be broken up and sent to serve with foreign units. After all it was important that Australian mateship and camaraderie be maintained and nurtured at all costs. It was Andrew Fisher, who was Prime Minister between 1908 and 1915, who pledged that:</para><quote><para>Australia will stand beside our own to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling.</para></quote><para>It was precisely that sort of mateship that set us apart from the rest of the worldin many ways it is the way in which the Anzac legend was born and thrives to this day. To many Australians, Anzac Day is the essence of being Australianâthe reliance of mates in times of trouble, the ability to sit down over a few, or a lot, of drinks and have a good yarn and then to be able to slap your friend on the back and call them a `bastard' for telling such horrendous stories is Australian. I well recall the reminiscences of my father, a World War II veteran, and how he met the very best friend of his life on Anzac Day in the Earlwood hotel in 1946.</para><para>One of the next milestones in Australia's development came in the form of the Great Depression. Whilst we fared poorly during the Depression, there were not any scenes of people wheeling barrows full of money from the bank due to hyperinflation. But our performance throughout this time was of sufficient concern to warrant a visit from the governor of the Bank of England and a subsequent inquiry into the banking systemprobably the predecessor to the Wallis report, in many ways. We might have begun to break the military shackles, but we still had a while to go before we were financially autonomous.</para><para>The advent of World War II brought even greater challenges to Australia, including real threats of invasion. For the first time in the modern history of the country, Australian soil was being attacked. Australian troops, in conjunction with the Americans, were fighting throughout Asia and the Pacific and, in keeping with our military reputation, served their country with great honour. Still to this day there are jokes about the fact that the best our enemies could do to us on our own soil was to sink a Manly ferry. That is a wonderful representation of the irreverent ability that we Australians have to laugh at ourselves and it is precisely the ability that enables us to forge on under great hardship. The reputation of the Aussie battler is well deserved. </para><para>Of course during World War II Australian women were actively encouraged to join the work force to help the war effort. Needless to say, many women took up this opportunity with alacrity, participating enthusiastically in the work force. This point in time really saw the turning point of serious female participation in the work force.</para><para>Even when joined in combat with the Allied forces, for example, the Australian Rats of Tobruk had earned a formidable reputation. Whilst the British government and military authorities considered Australian troops to be part of the British force, the Australian general Sir Thomas Blamey pointed out that:</para><quote><para>... his command formed part of a sovereign State, and that the requests of his government and its senior commanders in the field were to be accorded the respect due to them. </para></quote><para>Needless to say, the British complied.</para><para>It was post-World War II that saw in the era of net migration and nation buildingthings like the birth of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and also the birth of the legends that surrounded the construction of that particularly impressive piece of infrastructure. Towns in my own state of New South Wales like Cooma and Tumut were transformed from agricultural support towns to vital business centres. But nation building and the development of a national psyche will not always involve major infrastructure projects. It is also about the gathering of various aspects of everyday life. After allâand we have seen this reported in recent days in the media in Australiaâwhere would Australia and indeed the world be without the Hills hoist, which I understand is now facing endangerment, and that is of great concern? But even in the scientific world, Australia's pioneering efforts by people like Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnett and Howard Florey put us firmly on the scientific and medical world map, a position we continue to consolidate to this very day.</para><para>In terms of our post-Federation changes of character, I want to keep going through the nation's timeline, if you like, and look at another aspect of the post-World War II era in Australia. For the first time in our history, there was a substantial influx of non-Anglo-Saxon migrants, which essentially now represents the roots of our modern and diverse society. Many thousands of Greeks, Italians and eastern Europeans unwittingly became the catalysts of the formation of our modern society in the 1950s. They were later joined by thousands of Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s to form a society that fortunately I and many others regard as tolerant and harmonious, and one that is envied the world over. In fact, participating in a society like that is one of the bonuses of this particular role that we carry out as senators of the Commonwealth, particularly, for example, when I look around Greater Western Sydney.</para><para>I remember very early in my period as a senator going to St Felix's Primary School in Bankstown and being told by the principal of the school that, although there were 600 children sitting on the floor in front of me, they represented about 48 different national backgrounds. That is very much the diversity of Western Sydney and in my view the crucible of the future of Australia. </para><para>As Australians, through good fortune and perhaps our maturity, we have not been subjected to the sort of class or ethnic wars or troubles within our society that so many of our international brethren have. The vast majority of Australians really acknowledge that this is not part of our nation's psyche. The abolition of the White Australia Policy, by a Liberal government, crystallised the solid foundation of our multicultural nation. As I said, that diversity manifests itself in schoolyards, communities and streets all over this countryâin culinary terms, in the street, in dress and in worship.</para><para>The developments from the time of Federation are also further reflected in the gradual reduction of our reliance on England as a trading partner, placing Australia in a solid economic position for the future. We spread our trade amongst numerous countries, not just a handful. We can weather the economic storms as witnessed in the recent Asian economic crisis. This is a pragmatic and rational approach to international trade that sees us flourish and prosper while many of our trading partners in the region have travelled a rockier path. The fact that market forces and not armed forces keep our wheels of industry turning is testimony to our ability to trade on an even playing field. We have the world's most efficient farmers and miners.</para><para>Since Federation Australia has matured as a nation but also as a people. We have managed to maintain our distinctive, irreverent and, these days, world-renowned sense of humour. Yet at the same time we have been leaders in so many fields. Our achievement in the arts, for exampleâwhether we talk about world-renowned cinematographers like Dean Semler or directors such as Patricia Lovell and Bruce Beresford; our technical work and what we do in front of the camerafrom the days of Peter Finch to Nicole Kidman, demonstrates what a vital role Australia has played on the world stage. That is not to mention other areas of endeavour like medicine, technology, defence and so on.  </para><para>Whilst as a nation we have come a long way, we still have many challenges ahead of us. Australia is now walking in a considered fashion down the road to reconciliation and, with time, I am sure we will achieve that aim. There are very important roles for young Australians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to perhaps draw the nation forward on this issue.</para><para>On another matter, the 1998 Constitutional Convention brought together opposing sides of the constitutional debate to adopt a more mature approach to the issue of constitutional changeâan issue that clearly is not finished. The years to come will see further debate on this topic and that will probably lead to another referendum. As long as the participants in the debate are mature and focused in their approach, the outcome will be beneficial for us as a nation. Personally I do not want to see revisited the `don't trust politicians' approach. I do not believe it benefited anyone. I remain and regularly describe myself as `an optimistic republican'a glass half full rather than half empty sort of republican.</para><para>In another area, in the sporting realm, we amaze our opponents and sometimes ourselves time and time again, in cricket, in rugby union, in rowing and in tennis, to name a few. I think it was John F. Kennedy who remarked in the early 1960s what an extraordinary number of amazing sports men and women Australia turned out for a nation with such a relatively small population. He was absolutely struck by our capacity to compete and to win. We are one of a few countries to have hosted the Olympic Games and one of fewer still who have hosted them twice. Naturally, being a senator who represents New South Wales and based in Greater Western Sydney, I think the Sydney Olympics was by far the best, but my Victorian colleagues may seek to debate the point.</para><para>I think it is a mark of the nation's development, the changes wrought over the decades and our maturity that many of the celebrations that will take place at the Centenary will involve those members of our modern and multicultural Australia. The images of the events of Federation dominated by Victorian pictures and Victorian scenarios will remain as part of the past. For example, I just recently attended a celebration of the Vietnamese community's 25 years in Australia at the Casula Powerhouse of the Arts, marking their interest in the Centenary of Federation and the contribution that they could make. The path to the future involves all members of the community and so, next year, we are going to see and experience Chinese dragons, Zen Buddhist tea ceremonies, Zen meditation demonstrations, pipe bands, operas, a woven tapestry which will promote reconciliation and multiculturalism, the Yeperenye Dreaming Festival, which is a recognition of the first Australians and a welcome to all Australians, the Te Aka Matua and the Chinese Chao Feng orchestras, to name just a few of the events.</para><para>The path ahead, I think, is well lit. We have set in place solid ties that bind every one of us, and our mature and determined approach to most aspects of life is the envy of the world. I said in my earlier comments last week that our celebration must be about the past, the present and the future, taking all that is good from the past and the present, acknowledging and regretting the errors of the past, but, most importantly, having our diverse, dynamic nation looking optimistically towards its unbounded future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads to Recovery Program</title><page.no>20856</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>20856</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is the third last day before the parliament gets up. The program is very heavy and, to assist the management of government business and the whips, I have agreed to make my remarks on Roads to Recovery at this particular time rather than burn up the clock when the time is needed for very important legislation that must get through before the end of this week. I know that we all want to go home and look after the things that we have to do in the electorate.</para></talk.start><para>The Roads to Recovery program is the largest infrastructure investment program undertaken by a Commonwealth agency. Today we are looking at an investment of around $1.6 billion and that is on top of the government's contribution of $688 million for national highways, $141 million for roads of national importance or, as they are colloquially called, RONIs, and $40 million for that very popular black spot program that takes into consideration the worst accident areas on non-Commonwealth government roads. It is a great investment where you can put a set of lights in, put line markings on the road or do something that is relatively cheap that will alleviate accidental deaths and accidents. Our traditional $406 million to local government for their local government roads is a very popular program. On top of all those things, we are putting in $1.6 billion for local and arterial link roads in the outer metropolitan areas over the next four years.  </para><para>I want to confine my remarks to the roads that are going out into rural and regional Australia. We have many roads that local governments are responsible for and those roads, it is well known, have been the subject of many discussions. Some of those roads have been recognised as being in appalling condition. Local government has not had the funds to maintain those roads other than run a grader over them every now and again.</para><para>The opportunity in this package allows us to pick up some of the local roads that are in desperate need of repair. By chance, there is a federal local government conference on down here. We have had a procession of local government people through our offices and we had breakfast with them this morning, and I can say that this package is universally applauded by everyone in rural and regional Australia and in every other part of Australia. </para><para>The Labor Party are so negative and can never praise any actions that this government takes. They demean this package and say that it is a boondoggle, it is not necessary, it is pork-barrelling, or you can smell pork frying. I want to give the Labor Party a few words of advice. I believe that to have a good government you must have a good opposition to keep the government on its toes, and I think the Labor Party are failing miserably because they have not got a direction. They are failing because they are against everything, even a $1.6 billion package. They are failing because they are against everything that this government does but then proceed to say that it is part of the policy. Out in the rural electorates there is confusionâno-one knows what the Labor Party stand for anymore. They understand that the Labor Party are against GST but are going to vote for it. They are against this package but I presume they will vote for it. They are against many things but in the end they vote for themâas with education. So they seem to be running a very negative line but then do not have any original ideas of their own.</para><para>This policy started off in a Moree conference that John Anderson called two or three years ago. It was not just a thing that was done on the spot. At that Moree conference on local government local roads became the issue of most importance. All levels of the conference brought local roads to the attention of John Anderson and they wanted boosting for local government roads. So that was the genesis of this program. It was not a matter of saying, `There is an election coming up. Let us see if we can put some money out there.' This started two or three years ago. Then the regional summit held in October last year re-emphasised the critical importance to regional communities of their road links to the outside world both for social and economic purposes. Now we see the government delivering on this local government road program. It is one part of a series of packages that have been delivered to rural and regional Australia.</para><para>Some people complain about the excise on fuel. They believe that you can decouple the excise on fuel on 1 February and hold the 1Â½c a litre expected riseâit would cost the government  $600 million. The price of petrol goes up and down and ranges around 10c a litreâa little more out in rural Australiaâbut when the price of fuel does go down the 1Â½c will not be recognised.</para><para>What will be recognised out there are the millions and millions of dollars for roads that are going into these various shire councils: Boonah, $970,000; Aramac, $1.258 million; Fitzroy, which would be a Labor council, $1.709 million; Jericho, Livingstoneâall those councils are getting this massive boost. That does not only provide roads, as Senator Ludwig would well know, because I do see Senator Ludwig out in the rural areas from time to time. He is always welcomed out there. No-one would vote Labor out there but they do like to see him out there. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>âSome of them do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>âOf course some of them doâthe odd 10 or 12 per cent. Nevertheless, Senator Ludwig is always very welcome in rural Australia and rural Queensland. He has been on an exercise with me to Yuleba, Roma and other places. It is very good to see him out there taking an interest. Senator Ludwig would know, because he is a product of rural Australia, that this money does not only provide roads out there; this money provides jobs and opportunities. Many small towns are underpinned by the shire councils. If there is money for roads, there is money to have people working on the roads and there is money for the towns. The children go to the school, they keep the school open and they keep more teachers in the school.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have one shire council in mindâBoulia. It is only a tiny town of about 400 peopleâ200 white people, 200 black peopleâand it relies totally on road funding for the massive road infrastructure that they look after. I spoke to the mayor of Boulia only yesterday. They are absolutely delighted with this package. They see that, apart from the roads, it will give a huge boost to job creation in that town. They have about 70 or 80 people, depending on the time of the year, working in local councils out there. They are absolutely delighted that they will be able to maintain their work force and their road system and bring prosperity into the town.</para><para>The Labor Party's response was par for the course: negative. The Labor Party as part of their policy also wanted to remove the black spot road fundingâanother $40 million from roads. I would hope when this debate comes on that Senator Ludwig and the other people who represent the Labor Party will get up and applaud this program for what it is: a great boost for rural roads that was needed so badly and a great boost to employment in rural Australia. If we have a healthy local government in rural Australia we will stop the drift away from and the closure of many of our small towns. I know that both sides of politics do not want to see the whole of Australia sucked out in the middle, leaving it empty like a doughnut, with everyone living on the coastal areas of Australia.</para><para>I must say that, apart from this $1.6 billion package that was delivered today, there has been a 24c a litre tax cut in the price of diesel. If the Labor Party had had its way, fuel would have been dearer by 10c a litre at the moment. It is all right to get out and cry crocodile tears and say, `We will cut the excise by 1Â½c a litre.' You voted against a 24c a litre cut. You voted against a 6.7c a litre cut for fuel that would be used on business. You have absolutely lost any credibility out there. I want that to be put on the record.</para><para>We have also delivered a $560 million regional health package, $111 million to ensure farm families have access to family support, $120 million to strengthen family community support programs, $83 million for the sugar package, and $10 million for a trawling package. This government has delivered for rural Australia time and time again. I think it has been probably the most generous government to rural Australia in the history of Australian governments. It has always been there to offer a helping hand when various industries, whether it be the dairy industry, sugar industry or pig industry, got into trouble. This Liberal-National Party government has always been there to put out the hand of help and say to them, `Righto, we will give you a leg-up; the tough times are here.' Even yesterday, a huge package went out for the people that were affected by floods.</para><para>I do not know where Country Labor are on these things. We have a nom de plume of `Country Labor'. It was a great idea at the time, but actions speak louder than words. Country Labor are there in name. They are certainly not there in any way supporting rural and regional Australia. This government has delivered many packages. This $1.6 billion is another example of how good this coalition is to rural Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Queensland</title><title>Englart, Mr Vince</title><page.no>20859</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Englart, Mr Vince</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>20859</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to address a few different subjects briefly in the time available to me this afternoon. They are mostly to do with the environment in my home state of Queensland. Firstly, I think it is important to draw attention to a very important conference that was held a few weeks back. Whilst I saw some coverage of it in the press, it really did not get the attention that it deserved. This was a meeting of coral reef experts from around the world in Bali a few weeks ago.</para></talk.start><para>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority played a central role in that, as they should as a leading management agency of the world's largest reef marine ecosystem. They were able to outline and explore a number of important issues there, including some of the planned changes to move from prescriptive tourism permits to a more self-regulatory system. This move, which the Democrats will certainly watch with interest, will protect the biodiversity of the region through the representative areas program, a program which has the potential to be very valuable. Like all programs, the test will be in how it is put together, but certainly the intent of it is something that needs to be supported.</para><para>There are also issues such as enforcement of regulations introduced to protect the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, which is the crucial issue not just for Queensland but for the federal parliament, the authority and the government. There are also issues such as planning and environmental impact management and use of impact monitoring programs to minimise environmental risk during major developments. It is pleasing to see the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority playing a leadership role in that area. Whilst I have been critical of the authority in the pastâand I am sure I will be in the futureâI think their expertise and the importance of their role does need to be recognised wherever possible. It is best to try and work with them rather than against them.</para><para>The protection of the reef is something that certainly the Democrats, and I believe most people in Queensland, believe is a crucial issue. The great concern that came out of that Bali conference was the uncertain future of reefs around the world. In many ways Queensland's Great Barrier Reef, whilst having some problems and areas where it is under threat, is still performing better than many other reefs and ecosystems around the world, which are basically in serious decline and danger in many circumstances. There is a big threat to the reef not just from global warming and coral bleaching, which have been raised many times in this chamber in recent weeks, but in terms of the impact particularly of land based pollutants. At that conference the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority themselves presented a paper which outlined some of the significant effects and potential threats that are now evident on inshore reefs, seagrasses and marine animals.</para><para>As an example, studies show that levels of chlorophyll A, which serves as a warning of nutrient overload, are up to three times higher in coastal waters near land with high human use compared with pristine catchments. Inshore reefs are subject to concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus up to 100 times greater than normal during flood peaksâlevels that are known to damage coral ecosystems. Pollution loads are predicted to continue to increase and it is unlikely that current management regimes will prevent this. It is important to note that the authority itself said that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act does not provide effective jurisdiction of the catchment. That is a serious issue and we need to look further at land based activities, whether they are coastal developments, agriculture such as cane farming or land clearing for cattle. Nobody is saying, `Close down the cane farms,' or anything like that. But we do need to be aware that there clearly is an impact. It is not a matter of having a conflict over that; it is a matter of recognising it and changing our management regime so that the impact is reduced and, ideally, eliminated. The health of the reef is in the interests of all Queenslanders, and the economic benefits that flow from the reef also need to be acknowledged. </para><para>Another issue in Queensland that I wish to touch on briefly relates to what is unfortunately still a widespread practice of killing bats that are a threat to orchards. As Queensland is quite rightly renowned for its magical and marvellous tropical fruits, such as mangoes, pawpaws, bananas and lychees, this is an issue that people, such as me, who consume such fruits need to be aware of. Obviously when we consume we are part of the production process. One of the aspects of the production process which concerns the Democrats is the widespread practice of killing bats. I will give one example that has come from conservationists in North Queensland: for three nights in a row, 300 to 500 dead bats, electrified and found hanging from wiring or on the ground, were deliberately killed each night. This was reported to National Parks. It was discovered that the orchardist did not actually have a permit to kill the bats. National Parks' response was to go out and issue the orchardist with a permit, which is a concern. The original application had actually been to kill 5,000, but National Parks reduced that to 500âwhich is something, I guess.</para><para>We need to look at alternatives. A little while ago I spoke with Les Hall, from the University of Queensland, who is an expert on bats. He has concerns about the flying foxâsome of these species are threatened and endangered, I should emphasiseâand about the threat that inappropriate management by orchardists places on these bats. There are alternatives, particularly netting. I recognise there are costs involved, there is a bit of updating and maintenance, but there are also costs involved in slaughtering bats. Studies show that in the long runâindeed, within a couple of yearsâthe costs of netting are far less than ongoing slaughter, year after year, so it is economical as well as saving the environment and species. It is an area where we need to look at changing management practices. That is a message to National Parks as well.</para><para>Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and note the passing of a great Australian and a great social activist, Vince Englart. He was probably not known to a lot of people but was a member of the Democrats for most of the 1990s. His obituary was in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Monday this week, for people who would like to look that up. I want to place on the record the amazing contribution that Vince made to society over his 76 years. He wasâand this will no doubt confirm Senator Boswell's deepest held suspicions about the Democrats!âa member of the Communist Party for about 50 years before moving across to the Democrats. He was one of those who voted to close down the Communist Party, recognising that its time had passed. But his commitment to social justice and, indeed, to environmental issuesâwhich the Communist Party, for most of its existence, did not have a particularly strong record onâdid not fade; if anything it got stronger.</para><para>His life and his record show that he was clearly a victim of the Cold War mentality. ASIO files show that his file was marked `Never to be employed'. He was someone who loved teaching. He was a highly qualified teacher but, nonetheless, was not able to teach because of his activity in the Communist Party. Whatever people may think, I should remind them that the Communist Party was a legal political party in Australia. Teaching's loss was society's gain as a whole. He worked as a builder's labourer for most of his working life but his passion and commitment to social justice and environmental issues remained even when his health declined. He was a voracious reader and an endlessly enthusiastic person in trying to spread the need to get a healthier planet and a fairer society. His legacy will live on in terms of all the people that he has touched and communicated with in getting people to recognise the importance of those issues and encouraging all of us to give such important issues high priority.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads to Recovery Program</title><page.no>20860</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>20860</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLike Senator Boswell, I rise today to speak on the Roads to Recovery program which was announced by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. It provides an extra $1.2 billion for rural roads in Australia. I would expect Senator Mackay to be an enthusiastic supporter of this program as well. This funding is given to local councils over a four-year basis and is pro rata. I can imagine that, if the Labor government were running this program, they would be playing favourites all over the place. We are giving it on a pro rata basis and the councils can expect the first payments next year. Every cent of this $1.2 billion will go to roads. The councils for New South Wales, the area I represent as a senator, will receive another 72 per cent of funding. I expect Senator Mackay to congratulate us on that. Despite the enormous benefits, there are some senatorsâ </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>âWe are hearing Senator Mackay belittle this program. I was very surprised that Bob Horne, the member for Paterson, criticised a program that is delivering another $44 million to rural roads in the Hunter Valley. On ABC radio last week he criticised this project and said it would have little impact on local roads. Let us go to the experts and ask what they think about this program. The Mayor of Gloucester Shire CouncilâGloucester is a town within the electorate of Patersonâwrote to the Deputy Prime Minister, thanking him for the $1.4 million they would receive under the program. I ask Senator Mackay in particular to listen to what the Mayor of Gloucester had to say. His letter said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... on behalf of Gloucester Shire Council I wish to convey our appreciation for the provision of additional funding for local roads.</para><para>For many years funding to bring roads up to a satisfactory standard has been a big issue for local government.</para><para>Your government's recent announcement will be welcomed by councils throughout Australia.</para><para>At last someone understands.</para></quote><para>Gloucester Shire Council is one of five councils in the Paterson electorate. The whole area of Paterson will receive $8.8 million. Dungog Shire receives $1.4 million; Great Lakes, $2.3 million; Maitland, $1.8 million; and Port Stephens Shire receives $1.8 million. When you add up the funding for all the electorates in the Hunter, they receive $44 million.</para><para>I am really surprised that Senator Mackay is criticising this and also that Mr Horne, who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, would be so critical. Why? His electorate is receiving an enormous amount of additional funding from a government that has been able to manage its priorities in such a way as to be able to deliver thisâsomething that the Labor government could never do. They could never balance their books.</para><para>Mr Horne was a member of the Keating government from 1993 to 1996. Can you remember a rural roads package in those days? I cannot remember that. How about increased road funding? I can actually remember a cut to road funding. What about the Black Spots Program? That was a great initiative of the Keating government. They set up a Black Spots Program and two years later they scrapped it. This government has restored that program to Australia. If Labor were in power, would they bring it back? I doubt that very much. Under Labor roads were neglected. They have increasingly deteriorated. It is time that Mr Horne stopped his gasbagging, admitted that the Keating government did absolutely nothing for rural and regional roads and supported the Howard government's Road to Recovery Program. This has benefited those who live in the Hunter Valley and those who travel through it.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>20861</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title><page.no>20861</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>20861</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

Never forget it. We know who was responsible. In terms of the request that came out today, can I simply say that we welcome the increased focus on regional areas and particularly business programming, which I think most people would concede is an area of neglect, and I am very pleased to see that they are concentrating in those areas.

I know he is very interested in this issue, as are other members of his family. The federal government is very strongly committed to the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. It is a matter that has been on the COAG reform agenda since about 1993. Corporatisation will allow our biggest mainland producer of renewable energy to participate fully and fairly in the national electricity market. Of course, corporatisation will also enable the repayment of some $900 million owed by the authority to the Commonwealth. Corporatisation has been contingent on agreement being reached between New South Wales, Victoria and the Commonwealth on the outcome of the Snowy water inquiry, which reported some two years ago. It did take until October of this year for the two states to agree on a proposal to put to the Commonwealth in response to that inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>Today I am very pleased to announce that in-principle agreement has now been reached between the three governments. As part of that agreement, the federal government has decided to commit $75 million to deliver the first-ever dedicated environmental flow along the length of the Murray River. Under our in-principle agreement, the three governments will provide a total of $375 million over the next 10 years to carry out major water savings projects in the Murray-Darling Basin. This will be a major regional works program which will help reduce the huge loss of precious water from evaporation and leakage. The water saved by these projects will be used for environmental flows in the Snowy, Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers and key alpine rivers in the Kosciuszko National Park. Thus our agreement delivers not only corporatisation of the hydro-electric authority but a substantial environmental benefit for Australia's most important river systems. </para><para>I am particularly pleased that the Victorian and New South Wales governments have responded positively to our insistence that the agreement provide for a dedicated environmental flow to the Murray, which is, as we all know, under severe stress. Our agreement is subject to several very important safeguards: first, the interests of irrigators must be protected; second, the rights and interests of the state of South Australia must be protected; third, the commercial viability of the hydro-electric authority will be maintained; fourth, water for environmental flows can come only from verified savings; fifth, water for environmental flows in the Snowy and the Murray cannot be consumedâthey must flow right through the river systems to the sea.</para><para>I think this is a win-win agreement for everyone involved in the process. It is a win for those who want water to flow again in the upper Snowy. It is a win for those concerned about the health of the Murray. It is a win for irrigators and the people of South Australia. Most importantlyâcertainly from my point of view as Minister for Industry, Science and Resourcesâwe have also delivered certainty in what I think will be a very exciting future for the hydro-electric authority and its work force as a new corporation. I want to thank my ministerial counterparts, Candy Broad and John Della Boscaâthe man now famous for being far too honest to ever be National President of the Labor Partyâfor their cooperation in reaching this historic agreement.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Electoral Matters: Fraud Allegations</title><page.no>20866</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>20866</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Ellison, the Special Minister of State.

In April this year, the Australian government announced that it will provide 100 per cent bilateral debt forgiveness for countries which qualify for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Of the 41 HIPCs, only twoâNicaragua and Ethiopiaâhave debts to Australia and are expected to qualify. Australia strongly supports the World Bank-IMF enhanced HIPC Initiative, which aims to lower the debts of the world's poorest countries, subject to satisfactory economic and social policies, and links debt relief to poverty reduction. Australia has pledged $A55 million, in nominal terms, to the HIPC. It follows from what I have said that Australia does not have any bilateral debts with Zambia. However, the government is aware of the situation in regard to Zambia's application for HIPC debt relief. We understand that Zambia's application is currently being considered by the fund and the World Bank. Without HIPC relief, there will be an increase in debt servicing next year. With HIPC debt relief, there will still be an increase but this will be smaller.

The Taxation Office denied that it had said, in response to other matters which have been raised, that it was an LB&amp;I practice to automatically take an auditor off a case when a complaint was made. In the large business line, segment leaders are responsible for staffing decisions. Where there is a complaint, it can be expected that these decisions will be based on the circumstances of each case, taking into account the nature of the complaint, the role of the officer involved and the progress of the case, together with the broader issues of whether any such action could undermine the case officer and the best use of skilled resources.

In other words, we would not act to introduce mandatory domestic emissions trading in advance of any international emissions trading system. Anyone who thoroughly examines this matter realises that it would be unbelievably damaging to Australia to act unilaterally in mandating a domestic emissions trading system. This is the utter fallacy and stupidity of the Labor Party's position.

There is unity within the government on that. We are united in our view that it would be potentially very damaging to the Australian economy and to the Australian people to move down the path of a mandated domestic emissions trading scheme in advance of an international system, as has been verified by any number of reports and analyses of what this could do.

It is very important for Australians to understand not only that we are committed to pursuing the Kyoto protocol in an appropriate way but that, if this is not handled sensibly and appropriately, there is a huge risk to the Australian economy and to the Australian people. As the government have said many times, unless there is progress on involving developing countries, all we risk doing is having a flight of capital from this country to developing countries for some very important Australian industries that will not contribute one bit to the world's attempts to control greenhouse gas emissions.

This service will close earlier if all residents are relocated prior to this date. The approved provider has made priority arrangements for residents to be relocated to other accredited uniting church services, and discussions have also been held with Anglican and Catholic approved providers and with nearby services to obtain their assistance in the priority placement of Mont Calm residents. The approved provider has organised a team of counsellors to be available to assist residents and relatives during the relocation process, and this is the process that has been followed across the whole sector.

It was named `Black Magic'.</para></talk.start><para>There was also Reg Saunders, who served in the Second World War and is often hailed as the first Aboriginal commissioned officer to serve in the Australian forces. There are many more indigenous Australians of whom the nation can feel proud. Recognition was given earlier this year in renaming Canberra's tallest building at Woden. It was named the Lovett<inline font-style="italic"></inline>Tower, in honour of the Lovetts, an Aboriginal family which saw 19 members serve originally in the Boer War and then across both world wars as well as in Japan, Korea and Vietnam. There was even a Lovett in East Timor recently. There is a very proud history of indigenous Australians serving in our armed forces.</para><para>The military has now become a major career alternative. I am pleased to be able to report that the Australian Defence Force is now the largest single employer of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Indigenous enlistments are now at 1,207, the highest since the Second World War when around 4,000 indigenous Australians joined up to serve their country. This is more than double the 480 indigenous Australians four years ago, and includes senior ranks of a full colonel, a Navy lieutenant commander and an Air Force flying officer. I am advised that, until now, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has employed the most indigenous people, but it has now been surpassed.</para><para>The increased enlistment levels are the result of the Defence Force Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment and career development strategy which was implemented in July 1996 and named to encourage indigenous people to consider the Australian Defence Force as a career option. The strategy is jointly funded by the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, with quarterly achievements monitored by a joint steering committee. Aboriginal members presently comprise 1.2 per cent and Torres Strait Islanders comprise 0.3 per cent, making a total of 1.5 per cent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation. As the disclosure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent is optional, the actual proportion may be greater. Only a month ago Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, and the Prime Minister hosted the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion representatives who were brought down from the Torres Strait in honour of their service during the Second World War. </para><para>The strategy that the government is now implementing contributes to the overarching employment equity target for indigenous Australians under the Aboriginal employment development policy and to the process of reconciliation. The Defence Force has set annual targets to increase the number of indigenous enlistments to two per cent, a level more representative of the indigenous proportion of the Australian population. The advantages of this initiative are the development of an Australian Defence Force more representative of the country's population, increasing cultural diversity in the ADF and expanding the recruitment pool. A very proud membership of that is Norforce in the Northern Territory, with which I have had the honour to be present. They are contributing in the Northern Territory the advantages which are local to them and their knowledge of the local country. The Howard government is committed to creating greater opportunities for indigenous Australians. I commend the Australian Defence Force for playing its part and I welcome all those indigenous Australian men and women who wish to serve their country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>20875</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Employees with Disabilities</title><page.no>20875</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>20875</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday I undertook to get answers for Senator Evans and Gibbs to questions they asked.

Not just today, but over the last week, we in the Labor opposition have raised a number of matters relating to the way in which tax is collected at tax office level in this country by the ATOâthat is, the tax office. In particular, we have raised the matter of a Mr Breckenridge of KPMG, who apparently has many high wealth clients that he represents. That is his prerogative. Our particular concern relates to the matter of the auditors in the tax office who oversee the auditing, hence the collection, of the tax of certain high wealth individuals that Mr Breckenridge represents. Senator Kemp has been very careful to say that Mr Breckenridge did not remove an auditor from cases of high wealth individuals. In this case, we believe it is eight. Of course, the Labor opposition do not contend that Mr Breckenridge directly removed an auditor or auditors. What we are asking is: is it correct that he put pressure on certain officers in the tax office who then removed Mr Fitton from certain audits of high wealth individuals? That is what the Labor opposition is asking about. We also dealt with certain other questions today, which I hope Senator Kemp will speedily respond to, because at least in this instance it appears the Labor opposition know more about what is happening in the tax office than the minister himself. </para><para>It is particularly important when collecting taxation in this country that we have clear, fair and equitable tax laws. It is particularly important that Tax officers, particularly auditors in the ATO, are able to go about collecting that taxation in a fair, equitable and unhindered manner, free from pressure. I know from my personal observations at committee hearings in this place that the vast majority of ATO officers are able to do this. However, it is with regret that I do say that in recent times, at least, there is emerging evidence of particular problems in the tax office. These are problems that Senator Kemp should be aware of. He is responsible, as Assistant Treasurer, for the administration of the tax office.</para><para>A number of tax-effective schemes have been highlighted in recent times in the area of employee benefits, non-complying superannuation trusts located both here and overseas, and also in relation to trusts more generally. There is very clear evidence, including from the tax office itself, that these vehicles are being used overwhelmingly by high wealth individualsânot low and middle income Australiansâto minimise or totally evade tax. For example, in the case of non-complying superannuation trusts the evidence available is that high wealth individuals contributing to these vehicles can avoid contributions tax, the surcharge tax about which Senator Kemp is always so obsessed. This was a tax brought in by the government, allegedly to make the tax system fairer, but high wealth individuals have been avoiding itâthey have been avoiding the government's own tax. Senator Kemp still has not given a satisfactory explanation as to why that new Liberal Party tax was under-collected by $130 million in the first year. I would suggest they have been going into non-complying superannuation trusts. We know the difficulties that the Liberal-National Party is having more generally with respect to trusts. I am sure my colleagues will touch on that. </para><para>The Labor opposition is extremely concerned that it appears that some individuals representing high wealth cases in this country are able to pressure and have removed auditors of tax cases in this country. That process is not available to the ordinary man and woman in Australia on the street. Why is it happening with respect to certain high wealth individuals in this country? That goes to the very heart of, the confidence in, the Australian tax system. They are the sorts of issues that Senator Kemp should be dealing with. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>20877</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis afternoon we got the Labor Party raising the furphy of alleged maladministration in the Australian Taxation Office and consequential tax avoidance.

Why are they doing this? This is what we have to examine. Why is Labor adopting this approach? It is clear that it is because of the complete bankruptcy of their own policy positions generally and, in particular, their policy positions on tax. The Labor Party seek to criticise the governmentâin this case a government department, the Australian Taxation Officeâbecause the Labor Party have no policy alternative whatsoever to offer the Australian people. That is no wonder, because they are absolutely confused on tax policy. They are extremely disappointed at the success of the government's positive policies, not only in relation to tax reform but policies generally. Those policies have delivered so many positive benefits for the Australian community.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>Recent economic figures show the strength of the Australian economy under the positive policies of the present government and also as a consequence of our tax reform and our introduction of the new tax system. In the Australian economy today, unemployment has reached a 10-year low of 6.3 per cent as a result of some 800,000 new jobs having been created during the life of the present Howard government. The trade figures out today for October show a trade surplus of some $324 million. As we know from the mid-year economic review that was published a week or two ago, economic growth is expected to be higher than was predicted when the budget was handed down in May. Instead of 3.5 per cent, it is now estimated that economic growth for the current financial year will be four per centâvery strong economic growth. That in turn is leading to further employment growth of three per cent for this year. </para><para>This is all undergirded, very importantly, by an outstanding productivity performance. Productivity growth is 2.3 per cent, compared with just 1.5 per cent in the 1980s, when Labor were in office. The reason for that is not only our economic management but it is also a consequence of the significant reforms to industrial relations that this government has introduced. Our workplace relations legislation has freed up the workplace and allowed individual firms and enterprises to negotiate with their employees to establish terms and conditions of employment, subject to the required minima, that best suit the individual workplace and remuneration based on the productivity of that individual workplace. The direct consequence of that is this dramatic improvement in productivity. </para><para>So Australia's productivity growth now exceeds that of the United States. Inflation remains under control. Importantly, company profits before interest, depreciation and tax rose by 30.7 per cent in the year to the June quarterâagain, directly showing the benefits of this government's management and the positive way enterprises are responding to that management by lifting their production and profits. </para><para>Yet on the other side of the chamber we have a Labor Party completely devoid of policy alternatives, completely devoid of any valid criticism of this government. Therefore, they raise these unjustified furphies and criticise the administration of the Australian Tax Office. The Australian people will not fall for that pathetic form of opposition. They are looking for an opposition that is going to present some alternatives, at least to give them some element of choice. I am confident that, irrespective of what the Labor Party does over the next 12 months, the Australian community appreciates what this government has done for them, including the economic and jobs growth it has achieved and the benefits that this is delivering. I am sure that it will continue to support the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>20878</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe saw today in question time the Assistant Treasurer come crawling into the chamber to admit that he misled the chamber yesterday.

We are seeing here the administration of the tax office by the minister responsible and the tax office themselves in an absolute mess. We have the example of employee share ownership where this tax office have deliberately avoided turning up or answering the questions and coming clean on the extent of tax evasion that has gone on since 1996 when the surcharge was introduced. We have had to have four hearings and we are now slotted to have a fifth, because they will not come clean, they will not be honest. We have had the Commissioner of Taxation appear before estimates and hide behind the argument, `The DPP says I should not answer these questions.' He has used legal privilege to prevent himself from having to answer a simple question: `Did Mr Petroulias have a security clearance?' All of a sudden it is a matter of national secrecy. It is a simple matter of fact; it is not a debating point in a court of law. But, no, we have the government and the tax commissioner hiding behind the fact that there is a case going on involving Mr Petroulias. How long is the parliament going to have to put up with having the DPP tell it what it can ask questions about? This is a disgrace and the whole parliament should be ashamed that the government are complicit in using a legal case to avoid scrutiny of the affairs in the tax office. </para><para>We have this debacle about private binding rulings that have proliferated. The tax office, in the few answers that we have been able to get, have now admitted that they have given out private binding rulings contrary to the tax law. This is an extraordinary set of circumstances. The Sherman report went through them like a dose of salts, saying that there has got to be far more transparency, far more accountability and far more honesty in the tax office in how they have been applying private binding rulings. Yesterday in the parliament we witnessed the Treasurer himself having to admit that this government are going to go soft on taxing trusts because, if they do not, all their mates in the National Party and all their branch members out there who are into these trusts will be in uproar.

In any large organisation when an individual has allegations made against them and there is some sort of inquiry, it is not unusual for the person to whom those allegations are directed to stand aside. In so many disciplines, in so many walks of life, this is standard practice. I ask the opposition: why is it so surprising that the particular individual has had to step aside? The allegation is that it is because of pressure from an outside source. </para></talk.start><para>This is an attack against the very credibility and professionalism of the tax office. I have dealt with many Tax officers through my dealings with the parliamentary system and Senate inquiries over the years, especially during the large inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.

I completely reject the character assassinations that are essentially directed against a man who I have a lot of respect for, and that is the present Commissioner of Taxation. He has a big job. Very few people appreciate the scope of the change that has occurred in the tax office in recent years, the challenges that have been put upon them by the great legislative changes that have occurred. I pay tribute to the leading officersânot only to the tax commissioner but right through the senior echelons and right down into the more senior ranksâfor the manner in which they have handled those changes, cooperated with the outside world and attempted to communicate most effectively to make sure that everybody understands their obligations. </para><para>I come in here and, time and time again, hear attacks about the tax office and some of those officials.

We have been warned about mentioning names, asking for documents, using those documents and circulating those documents. We just have to start asking what is the agenda of some of the people on the other side. Are they no longer interested in the due process of law? Are they no longer interested in upholding one of our very important independentâin a senseâadministrative agencies that has the responsibility of discharging and applying the law fairly right across the spectrum?</para><para>This is indeed unfortunate, because there have been attacks on large professional accounting firms and some of their number. I remind the Senate that the tax laws are so complex nowadays that the tax office, like the Australian National Audit Office, like so many arms and agencies of government, have to rely on the special expertise out there in the community to get some feedback as to how the laws are working, what the difficulties are. It is not surprising that we find people from professional firms brought on board in a number of capacities. It is unfortunate that we link those particular names with their partners in firms involving hundreds and hundreds of people working right across Australia. I ask the Senate to think of the concept of the application of a Chinese wall.

We have never sought to attack any officer of the tax office; rather, we are seeking to ensure that they can actually get on and do their job. The allegations that have been reported in the paper are that a Tax officer, an audit officer, was removed from a particular case assessment of a very large business at the request of a Mr Breckenridge. Yesterday, the Assistant Treasurerâhe never could be Treasurerâcame in here and said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Let me make a couple of observations. The advice I have received from the tax office is that there are very few instances in which the ATO has been requested to remove an officer from an audit. When such a request is made, a decision is made by the ATO based on the merits of the case. Let me make it clearâand this is the advice I have receivedâthat the ATO would only consider removing an officer from an audit if the officer's behaviour was considered inappropriate or if there was a conflict of interest. </para></quote><para>That is a very clear statement.

But the Assistant Treasurer is not. He has had nearly a week to consider this matterâto make himself aware of exactly what the circumstances are. Yesterday he said one thing; today he said something else. This situation that the tax office often finds itself in is very serious. If there is one thing that the tax office is charged withâand I have said this beforeâit is applying the taxation law of this country equally to all Australians. There are enough allegations that the tax office has to deal with in respect of that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have chaired one inquiry, in respect of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program allegations that Senator Chapman raised. The reality is that there was sufficient evidence presented to that committee to suggest that there are problems, yet this government has failed to address those problems either legislatively or administratively. You cannot have an Assistant Treasurer who cannot make himself aware but also cannot deal with the problems at hand. How can you expect the tax office to administer this great thing called the GST you have lumped on them when you will not provide them with the assistance they need to maintain integrity and apply the taxation law equally to all Australians? We will have another inquiry for Senator Watson's benefit and I hope he will come along to some of the hearings and take part in fixing some of this up. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Zambia: Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative</title><page.no>20881</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20881</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Woodley today, relating to the foreign debt of Zambia.</para></motion><para>I want to speak about the issues behind the question I asked Senator Hill today dealing with the debt that Zambia is saddled with. Zambia is due to receive debt relief soon, but that is very much debt relief in inverted commas. This is under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which is supposed to ensure that these HIPC countries have debt reduced to what creditors call `sustainable levels'. The proposal is being considered by the IMF and the World Bank, but unfortunately it is for Zambia to pay more in debt servicing, when it gets debt relief, than it is currently paying. This is because its earlier debt problems were dealt with through new loans which are soon to come up for repayment. Instead of recognising the country could not afford to pay, yet again rules set by the IMF and the World Bank matter more than the survival of people.</para><para>Zambia is one of the world's poorest countries. I gave some statistics this afternoon, but let me add to them. Life expectancy in Zambia is 44 years, and dropping. I spoke about the level of AIDS in Zambia. Its spending on health is, despite the AIDS epidemic, about $A30 per head per year. This compares with about $A3,000 per year in this country. If the debt could be cancelled then that health budget could be more than doubled.</para><para>The creditors, in particular the IMF, are facing considerable pressure from the Zambian government and also from Jubilee 2000, which I have spoken about before as a very worthy worldwide campaign, to address this case and acknowledge that it exposes the wider inadequacy of the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Gordon Brown, chairing the key committee of the IMF/World Bank meetings in Prague in September this year, promised that: </para><quote><para>in the case of Zambia where we see the figures, we recognise that there has got to be something done; in other words, that the debt payments have got to be looked at given the way their flow is going to come over a number of years.</para></quote><para>However, the IMF has failed to reach consensus on a way out of Zambia's problem. This is because any real solution would involve breaking the current HIPC rules, and they are not prepared to do that for fear of setting a precedent. Four options were proposed by the IMF, but Dr Katele Kalumba, Zambia's Finance Minister, refused to accept any of them on the grounds that all would leave Zambia with unaffordable repayments. Citing the extent of poverty and HIV infection, Dr Kalumba argued that Zambia needs 100 per cent debt cancellation and anything less than that will destroy the country. The most likely outcome from the critical board meetings in the next two weeks will be that the IMF will heavily front-load Zambia's debt repayments over the next ten years. This just means delaying the problem, not solving it. This country is due to reach decision point. It is essential and critical that Australia uses its influence to do something about a problem which is only going to get worse unless we can come up with proper answers. Anything that the Australian government can do to help Zambia and other highly indebted poor countries would certainly be supported by the Australian Democrats.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>20882</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>20882</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for consideration and report by 4 April 2001.</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bourne</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	notes the restructure of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) executive and program output areas;</para><para>	(b)	expresses its concern:</para><para>	(i)	over the costs associated with this restructuring, the increase in the salaries of several members of the executive and the $6.1 million in total costs of redundancies for the 26 people who have left the organisation since 1 July 2000, and</para><para>	(ii)	that, while the Chair of the Board has stated that there would be no increase in the overall salary budget of the ABC, this statement appears at odds with the increase in the size and salaries of the new executive,</para><para>	(iii)	at the number of reported job losses to be made in non-executive areas of the ABC, and</para><para>	(iv)	that further staff reductions may result in a decrease in the ABC's program quality and quantity, despite the efforts of journalists, production and administrative staff;</para><para>	(c)	notes:</para><para>	(i)	that the reduction in overall staff numbers will not lead to an increase in cash or other resources available to the corporation, since the ABC's output is directly and inextricably linked to the number of people connected with content production, broadcasts and administrative support functions, and that in the short term, the costs associated with staff severance can be extremely high, and</para><para>	(ii)	that the level of morale within the corporation appears to be at an all time low, with staff increasingly concerned that costs are being diverted from program production to funding the restructure and other consultancies and headhunting activities, as demonstrated in the extremely low number of first run television program hours the ABC currently has in its inventory;</para><para>	(d)	expresses its concern that the ABC may be considering commercial ventures in order to supplement its budget shortfall;

As requested, I confirm that the amending Regulations do not infringe subsection 48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, and that in the circumstances it seems reasonable to make the amending Regulations retrospectively.</para><para>3. The Commonwealth imposes levies in relation to Commonwealth fisheries under the Fishing Levy Act 1991 ("the Levy Act").  The rates of those levies are set by Regulations made annually under that Act ("the Levy Regulations").  For the financial years beginning on 1 July 1996, 1997 and 1998, these were, respectively, the Fishing Levy (All Fisheries) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1996 No. 316), the Fishing Levy Regulations (Statutory Rules 1997 No. 312) and the Fishing Levy Regulations 1998.  The Levy Regulations operate prospectively in relation to the financial year in which they are made.  In accordance with section 81 of the Constitution, all amounts of levy received are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </para><para>4. Subsection 30A (1) of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 ("the R&amp;D Act") provides, in part, that:</para><para>(1)	There are to be paid to an R&amp;D Corporation established in respect of the fishing industry amounts equal to:</para><para>(a)	where a levy is attached to the Corporation âthe amounts from time to time received by the Commonwealth, under the Collection Act1, as:</para><para>(i)	the research component of that levy; and</para><para>(ii)	amounts (if any) paid, on behalf of a person liable to pay that levy, by another person, in respect of the research component of that levy; and</para><para>(iii)	amounts of penalty for non payment of that levy, to the extent that the penalty is attributable to the non-payment of the research component of that levy; and...</para><para>5. Subsection 30A (3) of the R&amp;D Act provides that:</para><para>(3)	Amounts payable under subsection (1) are to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly.</para><para>6. Subsection 5 (3) of the R&amp;D Act provides, in part, that:</para><para>(3)	...[W]here a levy or class of levies is declared by the regulations to be so attached2, the regulations must declare:</para><para>(a)	the whole or a specified proportion of the levy, or of each levy included in the class, as the case may be, to be the research component of the levy; and</para><para>...</para><para>7. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation Regulations 1991 ("the principal Regulations") establish the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation under section 8 of the R&amp;D Act (regulation 4) and provide that the levy imposed by section 5 of the Levy Act is attached to that Corporation (subregulation 4A (1)).  The amending Regulations do not materially alter those provisions of the principal Regulations.  The amending Regulations retrospectively amend the principal Regulations to provide that, for the financial year beginning on 1 July 1997, the research component was 9.5% of the levy imposed under the Levy Act and, for the financial year beginning on 1 July 1998, the research component was 7.2% of the levy imposed under the Levy Act.  In the absence of the amending Regulations, the principal Regulations would not have provided for any research component for those financial years.</para><para>8. The amending Regulations also amend the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (Amendment) Regulations (Statutory Rules 1998 No. 90) ("the 1998 Regulations") to provide that the 1998 Regulations were to be taken to have commenced on 1 July 1996 rather than 1 July 1997.  This was necessary because the 1998 Regulations amended the principal Regulations to set the research component for the financial year beginning on 1 July 1996.  Their original commencement date of 1 July 1997 had been set in error.</para><para>9. The amending Regulations do not impose any new levy or increase the amount of levy payable by any person.  They merely provide that an amount must be paid from consolidated revenue to the Corporation.  Subsection 48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides:</para><para>(2)	A regulation, or a provision of regulations, has no effect if, apart from this subsection, it would take effect before the date of notification and as a result:</para><para>(a)	the rights of a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) as at the date of notification would be affected so as to disadvantage the person; or</para><para>(b)	liabilities would be imposed on a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the date of notification.</para><para>10. The only material retrospective effect of the amending Regulations, and the 1998 Regulations as amended by the amending Regulations, is to impose a liability on the Consolidated Revenue Fund.  As that Fund belongs to the Commonwealth, the amending Regulations, and the 1998 Regulations as amended by the amending Regulations do not infringe subsection 48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. </para><para>11. Subsection 5 (3) of the R&amp;D Act requires the research component to be expressed as a proportion of the total levy.  It does not allow the research component to be expressed as a fixed number of dollars.  I understand from my conversation with the Authority's Mr Hyland on 25 October 1999 that it is not practical to prescribe a proportion of the levies imposed under the Levy Act that must be directed to the Corporation as the research component of those levies until after the end of the financial year for which those levies are imposed, as the Authority does not know in advance how much levy will be collected in respect of each fishery.  </para><para>12. I note also that information is provided to levy payers and the general public by way of notes in the Levy Regulations stating the amount of each levy that is intended to form the research component.  Although these notes do not have the status of law and cannot bind the Government when it amends the principal Regulations, they provide some transparency about how the money raised by the levies will be used.</para><para>13. In these circumstances it seems reasonable to use the latitude given by the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and make the Regulations as soon as possible after the end of the financial year in question.</para><para>14.

AFMA has advised that the basis for calculating the levy rate for the South Tasman Rise Fishery was changed at the end of last year from 10 cents per kilo of orange roughly to a flat rate collected from each permit holder. This transition was due to AFMA's concern that the previous levy system did not accurately reflect the costs of managing the fishery. As a result of the inaccuracy of the old system, the levy collected for the 1999/2000 financial year was in surplus of the management costs incurred in the fishery.</para><para>As the new structure was introduced part way through a season, the $3,000 levy. figure represents a transitional figure that is related to only part of the year. The flat levy rate of $3,000 per permit holder was calculated on the basis of the cost of staff managing the fishery and included costs associated with the development of long term management arrangements and the monitoring of vessels and catch levels. The total budgeted levy amount of $42,000 included all of these costs, plus a percentage that AFMA and the South Tasman Rise Australian Trawl Association (STRATA) agreed would be added to the 1999/2000 surplus to develop a dedicated research fund for the fishery. </para><para>The next levy amount, which is set out in the upcoming Fishing Levy Regulations 2000, will be significantly more as that amount will relate to the costs of managing the fishery for an entire fishing year.</para><para>I trust that this information clarifies the situation for the Standing Committee.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>WARREN TRUSS</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>20887</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection of Bills Committee</title><page.no>20887</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>20887</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>20887</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the 21st report of 2000 of the Selection of Bills Committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to have the report incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.

Since 1996 model offences concerning a wide range of topics, including conspiracy to defraud, assault, stalking, abduction, sexual offences, homicide, perjury, threatening witnesses, drug trafficking, the contamination of goods, slavery and sexual servitude have been developed following extensive nation-wide consultation.</para><para>The Model Criminal Code discussion papers and reports contain a comprehensive review of the law on each topic in Australia and overseas.  The work has come to the notice of the High Court and is now recognised throughout Australia and overseas as one of the more worthwhile contemporary law reform projects.</para><para>All of these areas of criminal law deserve, and will benefit from, greater clarity and consistency across Australia, and the Model Criminal Code project is a vital step towards this goal.  We have seen the benefits flowing from this project through the adoption by the States and Territories of various components from the Model Criminal Code, thus giving Australians greater certainty, protection and confidence under the criminal law.  We can anticipate that still greater benefits will flow as this project continues.</para><para>At the Commonwealth level this project has seen the continuing development of the Criminal Code.  When finalised, the Criminal Code will codify the most serious offences against Commonwealth law and establish a cohesive set of general principles of criminal responsibility.  This represents a significant improvement on existing Commonwealth criminal law, where existing serious criminal offence provisions are scattered throughout the broad range of legislation and of which it cannot be said that they are created, or interpreted, in a consistent manner.</para><para>An important step in the process of finalising the Criminal Code is to ensure that all offence-creating and related provisions throughout Commonwealth legislation are drafted in a manner which makes them work under the general principles established by the Criminal Code.  While a majority of offences will operate as they always have without amendment, there are some that will require adjustment.  It is important that all such amendments are made prior to the application of the Criminal Code's principles to all offences against Commonwealth legislation on 15 December 2001 in order to ensure there is a seamless transition.</para><para>The purpose of this Bill is to apply the Criminal Code to all offence-creating and related provisions in Acts falling with the Attorney-General's portfolio, and to make all necessary amendments to these provisions to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code's general principles.  The amendments will ensure that existing criminal offences and related provisions continue operate in the same manner as at present after application of the Criminal Code.  This Bill will be one of a series designed to apply the Criminal Code on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis.</para><para>A number of amendments to offence-creating and related provisions within the Attorney-General's portfolio have been identified as necessary.  These amendments are made in the Schedule to the Bill.</para><para>Significantly, this Bill is to remove duplications of the Criminal Code's provisions.  For example, there are a large number of offences of attempt scattered throughout Commonwealth legislation.  The Bill will repeal these superfluous provisions and instead place reliance on the Criminal Code's provisions.</para><para>An important component of the Bill is to provide clarity about the application of strict liability or absolute liability to some offence-creating provisions.  Under the Criminal Code an offence must specifically identify strict liability or absolute liability as the case may be, or the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to each element of the offence.  This is necessary to ensure that the strict or absolute liability nature of some provisions are not lost in the transition to application of the Criminal Code's general principles.  If relevant offences are not adjusted in this manner many will become more difficult for the prosecution to prove, and therefore reduce the protection which was originally intended by the Parliament to be provided by the offence. </para><para>This Bill will similarly improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences by clarifying the physical elements of offences and amending inappropriate fault elements.  I anticipate that this measure alone will save many hundreds of hours of court time otherwise spent in complicated, and sometimes inconsistent, interpretation of offence-creating provisions.  It follows that courts will enjoy significant savings in time, costs and resources as a result of the amendments.</para><para>The Criminal Code is a significant step in the reform of our system of justice, and it is important that it be implemented in a way that is considered and pays careful regard to the way Commonwealth offence provisions are to work in practice.</para><para>This Bill is an important step in that process.</para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para></quote><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the 2001 autumn sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>20889</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics References Committee</title><page.no>20889</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>20889</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the time for the presentation of the final report of the Economics References Committee on the provisions of the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 and the practice of multi-site franchising by oil companies be extended to 8 February 2001.</para></motion></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>20889</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>20889</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask that general business notice of motion No. 789 today, which condemns the Australian Broadcasting Corporation management, be taken as a formal motion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âIs there any objection to this motion being taken as formal?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>20889</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâMy understanding was that this matter was to be postponed until tomorrow.

Almost daily, we are hearing from the ABC about the dismantling of more of its intellectual and experiential capital. We have seen in just the last 24 hours a nationwide strike as the ABC personnel defend their interests in what is a tortuous process of dismantling of the ABC by the Howard government and by its appointees, not least the managing director, Mr Jonathan Shier. Enough is enough. At some stage a stop has to be put to this rapid attrition of an organisation which is extroardinarily important to the Australian community. We all have to take note of the now enormous alarm in the Australian community that the ABC is being plundered by Jonathan Shier and his appointees, who are diverting money from the ABC itself into their own pockets in terms of management getting precedence over the funding of the ABC. </para><para>I would condemn this government for its cuts to the ABC full stop. But it is not just the cuts. It is the death by a thousand cuts being employed by successive appointees of Prime Minister Howard's government that alarms the people of Australia. We do not need a fourth or fifth commercial entity. We need public broadcasting that is fearlessly independent and which gives alternatives both in news and programming performances across the spectrum to the Australian people. The ABC is time honoured, it is loved and it is wanted for what it is. In the past years of this government, the Australian people have seen an accelerated dismantling of the intellectual capital, the faithful service and the wanted performance of the ABC. It is a process that we have to stand up against.</para><para>It is time to stand with the people in the ABC who have given their service to this country against these second-rate corporate peopleâsome of whom are corporate failuresânow being injected into the ABC to do a hatchet job for this government. It is time that we stood against that. Toying with words in this place is not going to help that job. I am amazed that there has not been a bigger uproar in this parliament about what has been happening in the last few days, as the ABC's most popular personnel make a conjoint appeal to stop the dismantling of the broadcaster's independence, integrity and intellectual capital. What is going to happen in the next year? After the last year, anything could happen, but the successive sacking of people who have been in the creative as well as administrative management of the ABC and the replacement with hacks from the big end of town, in the interests of conservative politics alone, has to be a matter which this parliament debates, and it has to be a matter in which we are empowered to intervene, if necessary. If there is one place to do that, it is in the Senate, where the government does not have total control, at the end of the day, of what happens.</para><para>I am not going to take umbrage at the fact that this is not going to move on to a full debate, but I think it should. I am not taking umbrage, because I understand that an alternative will be brought forward tomorrow by the Labor Party and/or the Democrats. If that happens, it will get my support, but we should have a debate on this, and we should have a clear message going to the government and we should have a clear message going to Managing Director Shier: you are doing the wrong thing by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, you are doing the wrong thing by the Australian viewing and listening public, and you are doing the wrong thing by the experts in the ABC whom you are sacking because you do not like what they have to say. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20890</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition will not be supporting a suspension at this time. We did indicate, as senators would have noted, that the opposition wished to have the opportunity to discuss the words of the motion. There are many aspects of the motion with which we can agree.

If another motion comes up tomorrow, we will be able to deal with it, but he clearly understood the consequences of moving today. We will not be supporting suspension to deal with this matter today. This matter could have been dealt with tomorrow with a formal motion, hopefully with which we could concur and, subject to the views of other senators, carried overwhelmingly if not unanimously.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the reason that we are not prepared to deal with this matter, I think I would leave that to others to explain privately to Senator Brown, but the fact is that I have no instructions to proceed.

We are very much in support of the reasons Senator O'Brien has just outlined. Could I also make the pointâand there are always exceptions to this, to be fair to Senator Brownâthat generally the whips will run through programming issues, particularly in relation to formality of notices. We generally are alerted to the issues that may arise and to the possibility of suspensions, and this was very much out of left field for the government. It was not expected, and I think that generally these things are better handled by negotiating between the parties so that we know what we are dealing with. Otherwise it is very hard to manage what is always a busy schedule in this place but which of course is far more busy because a deadline looms with the rising of the Senate for the summer recess in what is becoming a matter of hours. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

Through the NGS, the strategic framework for advancing Australia's greenhouse response, governments have agreed to forge major reductions in Australia's projected emissions growth.</para><para>The tabling of this report provides a good opportunity to reflect on the seriousness of climate change as an issue for Australia and the rest of the world.</para><para>There is no doubt that the world's climate is changing more than could be expected from natural causes. There is clear evidence that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now higher than it has been for over 420,000 years. And it is increasing faster than at any time during the last 20,000 years. More than two thirds of the increase registered in the last 20 years is due to fossil fuel burning.</para><para>It is also clear that the world's temperature has increased and that the 1990s was the warmest decade since records began in the 1860s. Measurements show that sea levels increased during the 20th Century and that there have been changes in rainfall patterns across the globe such as the decline in winter rainfall in south-western Australia. There is every sign that these changes will continue this century. </para><para>The First Report on NGS progress</para><para>It is because Australian governments have decided that there is too great a risk not to act that they have committed themselves to action.</para><para>The report makes clear the Commonwealth Government has been leading by example on climate change. Through the NGS and subsequent initiatives the Commonwealth has invested nearly $1 billion in our greenhouse response over five years.</para><para>The Prime Minister's 1997 Safeguarding the Future package of measures is a central element of the NGS. The package provides $61.4 million for the support and development of renewable energy through creating markets, funding industry development and commercialisation. The Government also has introduced legislation to require that, by 2010, Australia sources an additional 9,500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity from renewable sources.</para><para>On energy efficiency, minimum energy performance standards for equipment and appliances are expected to reduce emissions by over five megatonnes per year, on average, over the next decade and a half. Following agreement by all States and Territories this year, energy efficiency performance standards are to be introduced into the Building Code of Australia. Further, power station energy efficiency standards are expected to cut emissions by about four megatonnes each year equivalent to taking one million cars off the road.</para><para>Consumer awareness of motor vehicle fuel efficiency is also being promoted. From 1 January 200 1, all new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold in Australia will carry a fuel consumption label on their windscreens.</para><para>Australia's capacity to store carbon in vegetation is further being enhanced through the innovative Bush for Greenhouse and Plantations-2020 Vision programs.</para><para>The NGS is about partnerships between governments and industry and between different levels of government. In the voluntary Greenhouse Challenge program to abate greenhouse emissions-over 45 per cent of Australia's total industrial emissions are now covered. By the end of 2000, industrial end user Challenge participants are expected to reduce emissions by around 23.5 Mt per year.</para><para>Ninety-nine Australian local governments - covering nearly half of Australia's population - have joined the Cities for Climate ProtectionTM program, representing the largest number of participating local governments in the world.</para><para>Last year, the Commonwealth substantially increased its commitment to greenhouse response with the Measures for a Better Environment package. This policy package is consistent with the principles and framework of the NGS and provides nearly $800 million towards programs to support renewable energy and alternative fuels, and the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program designed to stimulate large abatement projects across the economy. The report on Commonwealth initiatives under the NGS is, therefore, far from the full story of what we are doing.</para><para>The NGS is also, crucially, about a partnership between the Commonwealth and States and Territories. States and Territories have key responsibilities in the areas of energy policy, land use change, transport planning and waste management. These areas are critical to Australia meeting its greenhouse target.</para><para>There have been some important steps forward by States and Territories in responding to greenhouse with all implementation plans now finalised and available on the NGS website - at httpll..ngs.greenhouse.gov. au.</para><para>But a much greater level of effort is required from States and Territories. States and Territories need to be prepared now to commit funding to making progress on greenhouse reductions. Only relatively limited funding targeted at greenhouse is identified by States and Territories in this report.</para><para>States and Territories have indicated a number of areas in the report where they expect to make emissions reductions by 2008 and beyond. However, assessments of their implementation plans indicate, they must strengthen their commitment.</para><para>The Government is Looking Ahead</para><para>Although international climate change negotiations have not progressed as quickly as we would have liked Australia's strong domestic efforts to achieve substantial greenhouse gas reductions continue - as this report makes clear. Staying on track to meet our Kyoto target will depend on Australian governments, industry and the broader community staying committed to reducing greenhouse emissions.</para><para>As part of maintaining the momentum for containing growth in emissions, the Commonwealth is consulting on important new measures.</para><para>The Government has agreed in principle to the development of arrangements that would allow industry to earn credit for actions that help reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions profile. Credits would be exchangeable for emission allowances that would be assigned to Australia if the Kyoto Protocol enters into force, and would be </para><para>useable within a trading system. Participation by industry in early crediting arrangements would be entirely voluntary.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>This first report on the implementation of the National Greenhouse Strategy indicates that Australia is making headway in implementing a range of measures which will contribute significantly to constraining growth in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. It recognises that the Commonwealth is taking the lead and has made the greatest commitment both politically and in committing real finance. It also recognises that there is much yet to do under the strategy's broad-ranging measures. To stay on track to meet the Kyoto target will certainly require continued effort on the part of governments, industry and the broader community. The Commonwealth Government is committed to this effort.</para><para>A copy of the National Greenhouse Strategy 2000 Progress Report is available at</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">www.greenhouse.gov.au/pubs</inline></para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>20893</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>It is somewhat ironic that, less than two weeks after coming back from the failed climate change negotiations in The Hague, Senator Hill in his report today is trying to put a positive spin on his role in greenhouse abatement. Yet it was the position taken by the United States, Japan and Canadaâand supported by the Australian governmentâthat stalled those critical talks. It is the government's inflexible approach, for instance, to renewable energy legislation which has stalled that legislation in the Senate. More importantly, the National Greenhouse Strategy, which Senator Hill has come here today to promote, has failed to deliver outcomesâdespite many positive aspects. Not one measure reported on by Senator Hill this afternoon has been fully implemented.</para><para>Australia's per capita greenhouse gas emissions have shot to the highest in the world, and they are growing faster than the rate of growth in the economy. While the rest of the world moves to break the nexus between economic growth and energy consumption, we in Australia have increased our use of greenhouse-intensive fuels, and emissions are skyrocketing. The executive summary of the report just tabled states:</para><quote><para>Growth in emissions ... was higher than anticipated as a result of a higher than expected rate of economic growth.</para></quote><para>Yet, for the first time in almost a decade, the emissions per GDP have increased. So emissions growth was not just a result of economic growth; it was a result of less efficient use of energy. Not only are we among the most inefficient users of energy in the OECD, but we appear to be going backwards.</para><para>The recent Senate inquiry into climate change examined the implementation of the NGS and its adequacy in addressing the greenhouse challenge confronting us. Evidence presented to the committee highlighted significant limitations in the strategy, including: the slow pace of implementation planning; the haphazard approach taken by governments in developing greenhouse policy; the gaps in the programs and inaction; and the lack of integration of greenhouse into other strategic Commonwealth policy objectives, including energy market reform, competition policy, taxation, resource management, industry development and transport. The committee noted the slow progress by the states in implementing agreed measures under the strategy. The committee noted that there was qualified endorsement of the strategy by some states, with Western Australia, for instance, seeking a 240 per cent increase on 1990 emissions, offset by some three million hectares of plantation sinks. The committee also noted that there were inadequate resources devoted by the states to ensure the effective implementation of greenhouse abatement measures and that there was ineffective coordination by the Commonwealth over design, progress and adequacy of measures.</para><para>A key aim of the NGS is to reduce duplication across government activities and programs. This is where the government is obviously failing. Senator Hill claims:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth has invested nearly $1 billion in our greenhouse response over five years. </para></quote><para>Once again, this is a spin by the minister. It is simply not true. The money may have been promised, but it has not yet been invested. The government's five-year package has only just started. If the NHT is anything to go by, it will be a long time before the government puts the money into it. In 1997, for instance, we had the Prime Minister's <inline font-style="italic">Safeguarding the future </inline>package of measures. These measures are central to the National Greenhouse Strategy. More than three years later, those measures remain largely unimplemented.  </para><para>The legislation which I referred to earlier is stalled in the Senate, and the government has no flexibility to pick up some fairly reasonable amendments by Labor and it has no capacity to pick up the amendments moved by the Democrats and the Greens. Minimum energy performance standards for equipment and appliances have been in the development phase for years and they seem to be going nowhere fast. Energy efficiency performance standards were promised to be introduced into the Building Code of Australia, but are years off completion. Power station energy efficiency standards were expected to be in place by this year, but they will not be fully implemented for a number of years. The voluntary Greenhouse Challenge program has been extended, with questionable achievement of emissions reductions over business as usual. Current reduction estimates include business as usual efficiency improvements. Senator Hill has called for increased financial commitment from the states and territories, but that is somewhat inconsistent with experience to date. </para><para>In conclusion, what is needed internationally and nationally is some real measures showing true leadership. We did not see that at The Hague. We do not see that in this strategy.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force</title><page.no>20894</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>20894</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI table a statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Defence 2000âOur future defence force</inline> together with a white paper on Defence policy with the same title.

And it complements the Governments strategic view of the circumstances in which Australia is now placed in our region and beyond.</para><para>At the outset, I acknowledge the Government's debt to the Minister for Defence, the Hon John Moore MP, for his tireless commitment to both policy and management reform within the defence area.</para><para>As a people, Australians have never taken their freedom for granted.</para><para>As an independent and self-reliant nation, we've accepted the unique demands placed upon us as the privileged occupants of an island continent.</para><para>We've accepted responsibility for defending ourselves, our homes, our way of life and, when called upon, to defend the rights of others.</para><para>Today's White Paper ensures we can continue to do so.  The Government's purpose is to provide Australia with the Defence capability it will need over the first few decades of this new century.</para><para>We are grateful for the role played by many Australians during the process of preparing the White Paper.  Under the leadership of Andrew Peacock, former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to the United States, we undertook the most extensive public consultation on defence issues in Australia's history.</para><para>His report, published a few weeks ago, shows that a strong national consensus on defence issues exists throughout the country.  The views gathered were extremely useful in making our decisions on Australia's future defence force needs and I would like to personally thank all those who took part in this important consultation process. </para><para>It must be said, we have not undertaken this defence review because we face an urgent strategic crisis.  There are of course some important challenges, yet Australia remains a secure country.</para><para>In peaceful times it is sometimes easy to forget how essential a strong military capability is.  However, as we were all reminded last year, there are times when the whole country looks to our service men and women to do extraordinary things under exceptional circumstances. </para><para>That does not happen by itself.  We recognise a responsibility to recruit and retain the best people possible, to equip and train them to world standards and to ensure that all is done so that they may successfully face whatever tasks lie ahead.</para><para>But all of that costs a great deal.  Defence is one of our most expensive national undertakings.  We have an equal responsibility to ensure that Government funds are spent wisely.</para><para>Over the past few years, the Government has given high priority to reforming the Defence organisation and we have regarded this as an essential precondition for serious consideration of our long-term defence and funding needs.</para><para>Important reforms have begun.  Management practice has improved, waste and inefficiency cut, and responsibility and accountability tightened.  Great credit is due to the Minister for Defence, and also to his predecessor, Ian McLachlan.</para><para>The Government has ensured that the Defence Force was able to meet the demands placed upon it.  Defence alone was exempted from the budget cuts necessary in our first years in Government, and we have maintained defence spending in real terms ever since.</para><para>Early last year we took what proved to be a prudent and far-sighted decision to increase the readiness of our land forces, so that we were ready to meet the crisis in East Timor when it arose.  And we have provided substantial additional funding to support our East Timor commitments.</para><para>But, at the same time, the Government has been determined to step back from the day-to-day demands and review the basics of our strategic policy.  For the past twelve years Australia's defence funding has been flat in real terms, and indeed fell slightly in the early 1990's.  Over the same period, costs have increased in real terms in many areas of the defence budget.</para><para>The result has been a long-term squeeze on our capabilities, and on the people in uniform.  The Government became concerned that our defence budget was no longer adequate to sustain the existing set of capabilities.  Without action, defence spending as a percentage of GDP would have continued to decline.  So we have undertaken a comprehensive review of all aspects of our strategic policy, force structure, and funding needs.</para><para>Our basic objective was to provide a stable and sustainable basis for our defence policy by aligning our strategic objectives, our capability requirements, and our defence spending.  That is the essence of this White Paper.</para><para>We have taken a long-term view of all these issues.   Our key defence decisions are not just about what we need this year or the next: the reality of a modern combat capability highly dependent on advanced technology is the need to plan for the next decade, and even the decade after that.</para><para>We started by acknowledging the many positive trends in our strategic environment.  Economic growth and regional integration augur well for the future security of the Asia-Pacific.  But they cannot be taken for granted.  The relationships between the region's major powers will be critical for the stability of our entire region, and they pose challenges as well as providing opportunities in the years ahead.  Continued US engagement in the Asia-Pacific will be the single most important factor in maintaining security in the region over that period.</para><para>Closer to home, several of our most important neighbours are confronting new and difficult circumstances.  Indonesia's political transition and economic situation obviously pose major challenges to its Government.  Australia's commitment to supporting Indonesia's stability and territorial integrity remains steadfast.  PNG and many of the island states of the Southwest Pacific likewise face a range of domestic challenges.</para><para>The White paper reaffirms that we take a total view of security that goes beyond military and defence issues.  It builds on the assessments of our environment and the broad direction of our international posture set out in the Government's Foreign and Trade Policy White Paper published in 1997.</para><para>The White Paper reaffirms that Australia seeks to work with other countries to achieve our strategic objectives, and it recognises the strategic interests and objectives we share with our friends and neighbours in the region.  It places strong emphasis on our international defence relationships, including our key alliance with the United States, our bilateral and multilateral regional linkages and the importance we place on cooperating with a strong New Zealand Defence Force.  We emphasise particularly our long-term interest in good defence relations with Indonesia.</para><para>The Government believes that Australia's armed forces will continue to have a vital role in our overall strategic and foreign policy. We cannot easily predict when or where Australia might need to deploy its armed forces.  We think it important to both clearly establish our enduring strategic interests and objectives, and ensure we have forces to protect them under a wide range of circumstances. </para><para>This has been the approach we have taken in this White Paper.  We have aimed to provide a clear and comprehensive statement of our strategic imperatives, and to spell out the principles that guide our force-development decisions. </para><para>The Government has reaffirmed the primacy in our defence planning of self-reliance in defending our own territory from direct attack.  Such an attack is not at all likely under current circumstances, but Australia should, as a matter of enduring national policy, maintain the capacity to independently defend its sovereign territory against any threat that may emerge.</para><para>This means the maintenance of air and naval forces able to deny maritime approaches to any hostile forces and the capability to defeat any incursions onto our soil, without relying on help from the combat forces of other countries.</para><para>But while the self-reliant defence of Australia remains the basis of our defence policy, it is not the limit of that policy.  Our security equally depends on developments in our neighbourhood and beyond.</para><para>Over recent years the demands on the ADF, especially for peace keeping and other lower-level operations, have increased sharply.  Many of these operations have been far from home - in Africa and the Middle East, including the Gulf.  But the most pressing demands have been for operations in our immediate neighbourhood.</para><para>Today the ADF is deployed on operations in East Timor, Bougainville and Solomon Islands.  These operations serve important Australian security interests, as well as urgent humanitarian needs.  We may be called upon again to take a leading role in such operations.  The Government is determined to ensure that our defence forces are adequately prepared and equipped to work with our neighbours to protect shared interests and fulfil our responsibilities in the immediate region.</para><para>Beyond our immediate neighbourhood, Australia has important interests in helping to support the stability of Southeast Asia, the wider Asia-Pacific, and the global security framework.  The Government is realistic about the scale of contribution Australia can make to the security of the wider region and beyond.</para><para>We will not develop capabilities specifically to undertake operations beyond our immediate region.  But where our interests are engaged and circumstances warrant, Australia will be prepared to contemplate providing forces to coalitions supporting regional security.  The forces we develop for the defence of Australia will give us a significant range of options to make such contributions.</para><para>To meet all these strategic objectives, the Government has decided that Australia needs to maintain two key sets of capabilities.</para><para>First, we need high-technology air and naval forces that can defend Australia by controlling our air and sea approaches.  These forces can also contribute to regional coalitions in higher-level conflicts, as well as support forces deployed in our immediate neighbourhood.</para><para>Second, we need highly deployable land forces that can operate both in the defence of Australia and to undertake lower-level operations in our immediate neighbourhood.</para><para>To do this, we need to maintain the full range of military capabilities we have today, and significantly enhance many of them over the coming decade.  We need to increase the readiness, deployability and combat weight of our land forces, and progressively upgrade our air and naval forces to keep pace with evolving technologies and capabilities.  The government is determined to ensure that the ADF will have the capability to both fight and win.</para><para>This will require an increase in Defence spending.  The effective use of that increase, as well as the existing level of expenditure, also requires a new approach to defence planning to provide Defence with a clear long-term program of development to meet Australia's strategic objectives.</para><para>The Government has provided this in the Defence Capability Plan, which is set out in the White Paper.  The Defence Capability Plan sets goals for the development of each major group of capabilities, and provides detailed, costed programs for their development.  It tells Defence exactly what the Government expects, and provides a much clearer basis for financial management and programming within Defence itself.</para><para>The Defence Capability Plan covers the next ten years, and takes account of the need to invest within that period on new capabilities which will only come into service in the decade commencing 2010.  Within the disciplined framework of the Plan, the Government has made major decisions about the future of all our major capabilities.</para><para>The Army will be maintained at the increased levels of readiness that it has reached following the INTERFET deployment.  Under this plan six battalion groups will be held at high readiness including a parachute battalion, two light infantry air-mobile battalions, a motorised battalion and a mechanised battalion.  The current SAS regiment will be maintained and the commando battalion will be fully developed.  The logistics capacity for the support of these units  will be greatly improved. </para><para>Their firepower and mobility will also be enhanced.  Two squadrons of Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters will enter service, providing the Army with a major new capability.  An additional squadron of troop lift helicopters will also be deployed.</para><para>To better protect our forces, the Armoured Personnel Carrier fleet will undergo a major upgrade; new air defence missile systems and highly mobile mortar systems will enter service in the coming years, and our battalions will receive advanced thermal surveillance systems.</para><para>Soldiers within our deployable land forces will receive improved body armour, weapons, night vision equipment and communication systems.  In combination, these systems will ensure the Australian soldier remains one of the world's most effective combatants - in both peacekeeping and war.</para><para>The capabilities of our soldiers will be further improved by development of an enhanced combat training centre at which sophisticated computer systems will allow the most advanced simulated training possible.  This will be a world class facility.</para><para>The Government has given particular attention to the Reserves.  They will be given a major new role in providing the follow-on troops to sustain long-term deployments.  Legislative changes we have already announced will enable the Government to call forward reserves in a much wider range of circumstances, to help meet the demands which may well be placed on the ADF over coming years.  For those who join, the Reserves will become a more demanding, but also a more rewarding commitment.</para><para>The Defence Capability Plan commits the Government to a sustained program of investment in the air and maritime capabilities so important to the defence of Australia.  The plan includes upgrades and eventual replacement for the F-18 and F-111 aircraft, new air refuelling aircraft, a major upgrade to our surface fleet including the construction of a new class of major warship later in the decade, and a program to bring the Collins submarines up to their full potential.</para><para>And, after careful consideration, the Government has decided to proceed with the acquisition of four AEW&amp;C aircraft, with an option of up to another three at a later date.</para><para>All of this will cost a great deal.  To achieve the capability enhancements set out in the Defence Capability Plan, the Government will increase defence spending by $500 million in financial year 2001-02 and by a further $500 million in 2002-03, providing an additional $1 billion that year.  Thereafter defence spending will continue to rise by 3 per cent in real terms in each year of the remainder of the decade.</para><para>The capability enhancements in this White Paper will result in a $23 billion increase in Defence funding over the coming decade - a significant increase in defence funding by any standard.</para><para>This is a much more specific funding commitment than in any White Paper over the past twenty-five years.  It will provide the first significant real increases in defence spending in fifteen years. And we have taken the unprecedented step of providing funding projections over the entire decade.</para><para>On the basis of current expectations that the economy will grow about 3 per cent per annum over the decade, Defence spending will therefore be maintained at its present percentage of around 1.9 per cent of GDP.</para><para>This firm commitment to realistic increases in Defence funding will be welcomed by the vast majority of Australians, who recognise the importance of our armed forces to Australia's long-term future.  It will, of course, be especially important to those men and women who accept the special challenge of a career in our Defence Force.</para><para>This White Paper places special emphasis on the people of Defence.  They are a tremendous national asset.  The Government intends that this White Paper will make clear not just what the Government expects of them, but also that the Government understands what they need to do the job.  They are immensely committed to the vital work they do - I hope the decisions and commitments we are announcing today will demonstrate how strongly we value their contribution.</para><para>The White Paper also details a range of measures and initiatives to address some of the real issues, which confront our service personnel.  The men and women of the ADF do a job unlike any other, and they are in so many ways exceptional people.  But they are also people like the rest of us, who wish to raise families, own homes and educate their children.  We need to make sure that the special demands of service life do not make these things harder than they should be.  Getting these things right, so that we can recruit and retain good people into the ADF, will be one of the keys to our future military strength. </para><para>The Government has decided to increase support and funding for the Australian Services Cadets Scheme. It believes the scheme provides worthwhile and challenging experiences for many young Australians and can result in a lifetime interest in the Australian military. </para><para>The Government believes that the White Paper's decisions and commitments will also provide certainty to those in industry who make a vital contribution to our defence.  The ADF needs to rely on a wide range of people and businesses to develop and deliver the capabilities needed, and the Government places high priority on building effective partnerships between Defence and the private sector.</para><para>We also want to use our defence investment to help foster skills, innovation and technologies in Australia and, of course, provide jobs where possible.  The programs announced in this White Paper will have important consequences for many sectors of Australian industry.  For example, our shipbuilding industry should benefit from plans to undertake major upgrades and new construction work.</para><para>Of course there are many more important elements to this White Paper.  They are detailed in the document and will be spelled out in more detail by the Minister for Defence and his colleagues, the Minister assisting him, the Hon Bruce Scott, and Senator Abetz.  I would like to thank them and their team in Defence for the work that has gone into this White Paper.  I would also like to thank my colleagues in the National Security Committee of Cabinet and officials from the departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Treasury and Finance and the Office of National Assessments, all of whom have made a major contribution.</para><para>In addition, I particularly thank the Chief of the Defence Force and the three service chiefs for their valuable input in the course of preparing the White Paper.</para><para>The Government has every reason to be proud of this White Paper.  It is one of its major achievements.</para><para>It sets new standards in the clarity with which the fundamentals of our strategic policy are explained.</para><para>It sets new standards in the detailed program we have set down for the development of our defence forces.</para><para>It sets new standards by providing specific and unambiguous long term funding guidance for Defence.</para><para>And it sets new standards in the way in which the people of Australia have been drawn into the policy process.</para><para>I believe the result should maintain the healthy level of bipartisanship on the basics of Australia's strategic policy that we have seen in this place for many years.</para><para>The decisions set out in this White Paper ensure Australia will gain and maintain, well into this new century, the capabilities needed to defend this nation and make a responsible contribution to the security of our region.</para></quote><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to move a motion in relation to the statement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>20898</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>20898</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>20898</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the government's response to the President's report of 29 June 2000 on outstanding government responses to parliamentary committee reports, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO PARLIA-MEN-TARY COMMITTEE REPORTS RESPONSE TO THE SCHEDULE TABLED</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE ON</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">29 JUNE 2000</inline></para><para>Circulated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate</para><para>Senator the Hon Robert Hill</para><para>6 December 2000</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Access to Medical Records</inline></para><para>	The response was tabled on 30 November 2000.</para><para>Report on Proposals for Changes to the Welfare System</para><para>	The response will be tabled as soon as possible.</para><para>Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures</para><para>	The response was tabled on 31 August 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CORPORATIONS AND SECURITIES (Joint Statutory)</inline></para><para>Report on Matters Arising from the <inline font-style="italic">Company Law Review Act 1998</inline></para><para>	The response will be tabled soon.</para><para>Report on the Mandatory Bid Rule</para><para>	The response was tabled on 9 November 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ECONOMICS REFERENCES</inline></para><para>Report on the Operation of the Australian Taxation Office</para><para>	The response will be tabled as soon as possible.</para><para>Report on the Provisions of the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 and the Practice of Multi-site Franchising by Oil Companies</para><para>	A Government response is not required.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ELECTORAL MATTERS (Joint Standing)</inline></para><para>The 1998 Federal Election - Report of the Inquiry into the Conduct of the 1998 Federal Election and Matters Related Thereto</para><para>	The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters Report on the 1998 Federal Election contained a significant number of recommendations on a broad range of issues.

The amendments also insert `genetic information' into the existing definition of `health information' and insert two new sub-principles into National Privacy Principle 10 to deal with the disclosure of `genetic information'.</para><para>When enacted, the Bill will apply to information about individuals that is derived from genetic technologies to the extent that the information could constitute `personal information' about an individual.  To the extent that genetic information constitutes `health information', it will be subject to the same level of privacy protection afforded to `sensitive information' under the Bill.</para><para>The House of Representatives acknowledges that genetic information and, more generally, advances in gene technology, raise unique and complex privacy and discrimination issues.  The resolution of these issues will affect a wide range of sectors of the Australian community and therefore merit a more specific response.</para><para>The House of Representatives notes that the Government has announced that it will refer the complex issues raised by developments in gene technology to a joint inquiry of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Health Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council.  The House of Representatives considers that until it has the benefit of the result of the inquiry, it would be premature to accept the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 4, 5, 17 and 18</inline></para><para>These amendments operate to change the structure of the employee records exemption in the Bill and significantly narrow it.

All of the other information on a typical employee record would be subject to the provisions of the Bill.  This will impose unnecessary administrative and financial burdens on Australian employers.</para><para>The Government has announced that it will review existing Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to consider the extent of privacy protection for employee records and whether there is a need for further measures.</para><para>The House of Representatives does not consider it necessary or appropriate to impose such burdens on Australian employers without giving proper consideration to the need for such controls.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendment 9</inline></para><para>This amendment deletes the current definition of `personal information' in the Privacy Act 1988 and replaces it with a new definition that includes reference to `directly or indirectly' identifying an individual by reference to information or an opinion.  The current definition of `personal information' in the Act has worked well in the public sector for over 12 years.  This definition is also used in the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and referred to in the Customs Administration Act 1985. </para><para>The definition is fundamental to the operation of the Privacy Act, which regulates `personal information' contained in records.  Changing the definition would require an in-depth analysis of possible ramifications as well as consultation with the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner.  This analysis and consultation has not been undertaken.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendment 10</inline></para><para>This amendment inserts a definition of `tenancy information' into the Bill and is related to other amendments to the small business exemption that would deny the exemption to small businesses in relation to any tenancy information that they hold.</para><para>The House of Representatives is of the view that it is not appropriate for one particular group of businesses to be singled out in the Bill which is of general application.  The Bill provides the Attorney-General with the power to prescribe small businesses or particular acts or practices of small businesses that should be brought within the ambit of the Bill.  This is the appropriate mechanism to be used to address the issue of tenancy databases in the event that, after this Bill comes into effect, there is evidence that such action is necessary.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 11 and 12</inline></para><para>These amendments amend the definition of `organisation' in the Bill.  They provide that a `small business operator' is deemed to be an organisation (and therefore subject to the Bill) in relation to acts and practices concerning employee records and tenancy information it holds.  In addition, amendment 12 deems a small business operator to be an organisation if it accepts online payment for goods or services.</para><para>The effect of amendments 11 and 12 will be that a small business could be exempt in relation to some of the information it holds and subject to the Bill in relation to other information.  The House of Representatives considers that these amendments will create unnecessary complexity and uncertainty in relation to the application of the Bill.  The House of Representatives also notes that simply accepting payment online has nothing to do with real privacy risk and is not a proper basis for subjecting a small business to privacy regulation.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 13 and 14</inline></para><para>These amendments alter the small business exemption in the Bill.  Amendment 13 deletes paragraph 6D(4)(c) of the Bill and substitutes a provision which provides that a small business will be denied the benefit of the small business exemption if it discloses personal information other than with the consent of the individual or as required or authorised by or under legislation.  Amendment 14 deletes sub-clause 6D(7) of the Bill.  These amendments narrow the scope of the small business exemption and effectively introduce a new, broader consent based element into the exemption.</para><para>The small business exemption in the Bill has been balanced to ensure that small businesses that pose a particular risk to privacy will not be able to benefit from the exemption.  Accepting these amendments would mean that many small businesses would be denied the small business exemption without any evidence that they pose a risk to the privacy of individuals.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 15 and 16</inline></para><para>These amendments remove the mechanism that allows a small business that has chosen to opt-in to the coverage of the Bill to revoke that choice.  The opt-in facility is designed to enable otherwise exempt small businesses to take advantage of the commercial benefits that sound privacy practices can generate.  It is not appropriate to remove choice from small businesses.  As the small business opt-in facility is voluntary, the House of Representatives considers that these amendments would be a significant disincentive to small businesses opting-in to the legislation.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendment 20</inline></para><para>This amendment restricts the circumstances in which related bodies corporate are able to share personal information.  It provides that related bodies corporate can only share personal information with each other if (i) National Privacy Principle 1 (NPP 1) has been complied with; and (ii) it would not exceed the reasonable expectations of the community.</para><para>Addition of the Senate's blanket requirement to comply with NPP 1 is unnecessary.</para><para>Under the Bill as amended by the House of Representatives, an organisation subject to the Bill will be required to comply with NPP 1 when collecting information regardless of whether it intends to take advantage of the ability to share information with a related body corporate or not.  Further, where an entity that is not required to comply with the National Privacy Principles shares the personal information with a related body corporate, the receiving body corporate must comply with the National Privacy Principles (or code equivalent) relating to collection when accepting that information.  </para><para>An objective reasonable expectations test would seem to add little to the protection that is already afforded by NPP 1.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept the Senate's amendment.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 27 and 28</inline></para><para>Amendment 27 gives the Privacy Commissioner power to issue a breach notice where, in the Privacy Commissioner's opinion, an organisation has failed to comply with a determination issued by him/her.  Amendment 28 provides for the Federal Court to impose a maximum penalty of $50,000 where the breach notice is not complied with.</para><para>The amendments allow a court to issue a penalty based only on the fact that the time for compliance nominated on a breach notice issued by the Privacy Commissioner has expired.  This arrangement denies the court the ability to determine for itself whether there has been an interference with privacy.  That is, the court is unable to make an independent assessment of the basic allegations made against the organisation before the penalty is imposed.</para><para>These amendments go well beyond the co-regulatory approach in the Bill and attempt to impose a penalty provision that is not justified.</para><para>Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept these amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendments 29, 30 and 31</inline></para><para>These amendments separate the provisions dealing with access to health records from the general access and correction provisions in the Bill.  They insert new sub-principles into National Privacy Principles 6 which deal specifically with access to health information.  The amendments would have the effect of limiting the ability of record holders to legitimately deny an individual access to health information.  In addition, the amendments seek to provide that an individual may access health information of a factual nature regardless of when it was collected, but may only access health information containing matters of opinion if the information was collected on or after the date of commencement of the Bill.</para><para>The House of Representatives considers the treatment of access to health records in the Bill to be balanced and appropriate.  The House of Representatives notes that extensive consultation was undertaken in the development of the part of the Bill dealing with health information, including extensive consultation by the Privacy Commissioner.  The amendments disrupt the balance achieved through that consultative process.  Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not accept the amendments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Amendment 33</inline></para><para>This amendment introduces a new National Privacy Principle into the Bill designed to provide special protection for the personal information of children.  On a preliminary examination of the proposed amendment, the House of Representatives considers there are problems with it.  For example, there is no definition of `commercial service'. Any organisation providing services to children on a for-profit basis would potentially be covered, including childcare centres, schools and medical practices.  The provision could impact on the rights of the child, for example, the child's right to free speech and the child's right to seek medical assistance or professional advice on their own behalf.</para><para>The House of Representatives is also concerned about the possible interaction of such a provision on the operation of State and Territory laws, particularly those dealing with the protection of children and reporting of child abuse.  Privacy legislation should not be used as a basis for inhibiting a child's right to impart personal information to a responsible person if that child is suspected of being at risk of abuse.</para><para>The House of Representatives agrees that the notion of children's privacy has merit (subject to the necessary consultation occurring in relation to the issue) and could be examined further.  However, there has not been sufficient consultation in relation to the proposal to allow the amendment to be accepted.

The package that the government has finally accepted is not one that we see as an ideal package. We still see that there are some major flaws in it and we think that the government's response has been tardy and inadequate and has major gaps. However, there is one factor that the Senate needs to consider in addressing the message from the House of Representatives and that is, essentially, that we have a government that does not really want legislation in this area. We have a government that for years has dragged its feet in terms of trying to address private sector privacy issues and a government which in opposition resisted the previous Labor government's attempts to cover this area and to provide effective regulation. So, in essence, we are in a situation where those who want legislation have to accept what is basically a horse and buggy model for a high-tech era and environment. That is, in essence, what we have with this legislation. We have tried to take a constructive and balanced approach in this debate and we do recognise that the government has accepted some of the changes we have proposed. But these changes are nowhere near adequate to address the state-of-the-art technology that basically governs the collection of data on private individuals in the modern world. </para></talk.start><para>In terms of the government's concessions, I turn to the most important one and, we think, the most valuable, and that is the creation of an automatic right of appeal from the industry code adjudicators to the Privacy Commissioner, together with the abolition of the existing administrative review mechanisms contained in the <inline ref="R1049">Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000</inline>. The bill proposed a formal, inflexible process focusing not on matters of substance but only on matters of procedure. In our consultations on the bill, we received strong representations both from business and from consumer groups that the review mechanisms prescribed in the bill were unsatisfactory. Business groups, for instance, argued that decisions of the industry code adjudicators should not be reviewable by the Federal Court because the court would have imposed a formal, inflexible and unfamiliar review process on what were intended to be flexible and informal processes undertaken by code adjudicators.</para><para>It is always interesting how businesses run off to the courts for redress against each other, but they do not like consumers to have a capacity to seek redress against them when they break the rules of the game. Consumer groups, such as the Australian Consumers Association, have pointed out that, without the Privacy Commissioner having a central role, multiple and conflicting interpretations of similar code provisions in the various industry codes could develop. Therefore, we think providing the Privacy Commissioner with a supervisory jurisdiction over decisions of code adjudicators addresses the problem of interpretations of similar code provisions being applied differently across the different codes. We think this result is good for consumers and good for business but, most importantly, it will assist in the protection of privacy. We are pleased to have been able to force the government to accept it.</para><para>There will now also be additional reporting requirements for code adjudicators. Code adjudicators will be required to provide a summary of each complaint finally dealt with by the adjudicator in the code's annual report. This will provide the Privacy Commissioner with a better picture of how industry codes are being applied and it will give the commissioner a better understanding of where practices are not up to scratch. There will also be a concession by the government to pick up Labor's proposal in respect of the power of the Privacy Commissioner to review operations of industry codes. The commissioner will now have a broad power to review the operation of such privacy codes. This is a general power which the commissioner can exercise in response to concerns about the operation of the code or which, in fact, the commissioner could rely on as part of a process of random audits. This new power, once again imposed by Labor on the government, will strengthen the role of the Privacy Commissioner within the coregulatory framework established by the bill. </para><para>We have also been able to achieve a concession in respect of the right of access and correction to existing informationâa critical area of protection of privacy and protection of citizens. The government has conceded that more should be done to allow Australians greater access to pre-existing information and the right to correct that information when it is wrong. The bill will now provide for individuals to access and correct personal information collected before the commencement of the bill where that information is used or disclosed by the organisation after the commencement date. This is an important amendment which does reach somewhat back in time. It does not go far enough, but it does provide enhanced protection.</para><para>Finally, in response to concerns in relation to the breadth of the exemption for political parties, the government has agreed to insert a legislative note to clarify that the exemption will not permit the sale or disclosure of personal information collected by virtue of the exemption in a way not covered by the exemption. Once again, we were seeking something tougher. The legislative note will be an aid for courts to interpret this particular clause. We expect that that clause will be interpreted by the courts in the same way as our amendment, which was proposed at the earlier part of this process, would have been.</para><para>We support these amendments. There is, however, a lot of unfinished businessâa lot of other areas remain unaddressed. We have frequently criticised this legislation as being the weakest of all attempts at privacy legislation. It was always on again, off again, and when it finally arrived it was riddled with exemptions and escape clauses. It left many issues entirely unaddressed.</para><para>There is a wide-ranging exemption for small business, for instance, in this legislation which will entirely exempt more than 95 per cent of businesses. When one takes into account that on a day-to-day level most Australians have ongoing connections and business transactions with small business, this is a worrying exemption. There is a complete exemption for employee records, so employees will have no recourse against improper abuses of privacy in matters relating to their employment. There is an extremely broad exemption that will allow information sharing between related body corporates without restriction. There are no penalties for those companies which commit serious or systematic interferences with privacy, and the bill will have no application whatsoever until 12 months after it receives royal assent. Regrettably, therefore, the Australian public will not be protected in a matter on which they should expect their governments to protect them. There is a lot of unfinished business.</para><para>As a result of our pressure on the issue of employee records, the government have already effectively admitted that their bill is not good enough by announcing an inquiry into the privacy protection of employee records. This legislation has been more than four years in the making. I think the fact that the inquiry has not already been conducted and the matter has not already been addressed in the bill says a lot about the lack of concern the government show for privacy issues. It is a reflection on the minister's competence that it has taken him so long to get to this stage and taken so long to get to a stage where we have so much unfinished business.</para><para>In response to the issue raised squarely by the opposition, the government has agreed to look at the issue of children's privacy, a matter which was addressed in Reagan-Bush America some 12 years ago. It is perplexing that this matter has not been considered in the context of putting this legislation together.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>âThe previous Bush. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>âYes, I know that.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>âNo, this is 12 years ago, Senator Abetz, when you were probably still running Young Liberals in Tasmania. In fact, you might have been covered by protection of children's privacy 12 years ago.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Labor's amendments would have put parents back in charge of their children's personal information by giving parents control over who collects personal information from their kids. That would have been a most important provision. But the government have not accepted our amendments; they have cited possible unintended consequences and the need to consult with the states and territoriesâthe same old mantras. They should have been doing this for such a long time. Five years in the saddle and the Attorney-General has finally woken up to the fact that there might be unintended consequences on an issue that he should have been looking at five years ago. So the government has stumbled forward and the public will not be protected.</para><para>We are proud of the role that we continue to play in this debate in securing substantial amendments. We think the amendments we have secured will strengthen the operation of the legislation. However, as I said earlier, what we have here is a horse and buggy approach in the era of IT and the Internet. It will not be good enough for the moment; it will definitely not be good enough for the future. It needs amendment, and it will get amended under a future Labor government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>20909</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to register, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, my disappointment at the government's rejection of a number of amendments to the <inline ref="R1049">Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000</inline>. Our view is that these amendments should be insisted upon for the very reasons that were outlined in the committee stage of the debate on the legislation. Senator Bolkus actually provided us with an argument for insisting on these amendments when he outlined in his contribution some of the shortcomings of this legislation as a consequence of the government's decision to reject some of these amendments. I acknowledge that, in relation to employee records, there will be an inquiry by the government, but that is a shortfall; that is a next-best measure. That is not what the legislation required. Senator Bolkus said that he would like to see the legislation made harder or tougher. We have that opportunity if the majority of senators join together today to insist on the amendments before us.</para></talk.start><para>I have already recorded my concern with the legislation in its current form in relation to political parties, even with the Labor Party amendment that seeks to narrow or redefine the exemption that applies for political parties. The Democrats would have been happy to see that broad ranging exemption completely removed for the reason that we have put on record a number of times: how can we expect business, industry and members of the community and the public to adhere to a privacy regime that we are not prepared to adhere to ourselves? So I am disappointed that those original amendments of the Democrats were defeated. I know I should not reflect badly on a decision of the Senate, so I will not refer to that any further, but I will refer to the amendments of the ALP that improved the legislation in relation to that section by narrowing that exemption available to political parties.</para><para>It is one thing for the government to give an undertaking to ensure that the breadth of the legislation is somewhat narrowed because it will not allow for the sale or the disclosure of that information, but it is not just about that; it is about the community having faith in their political institutions, political parties, representatives and political organisations in that we are actually prepared to stick to this legislation that we are prepared to impose on others. But I am disappointed that there will still be so many areas of business and industryâand political parties and other organisationsâthat will not come into this jurisdiction and that will not be covered by this legislation.</para><para>I actually wonder whether this legislation should be passing at all in this form today. Senator Bolkus said that the government's role in this process has been tardy, and we are all aware of the recent history of the debate on whether or not the privacy laws should be extended to the private sector. The Democrats are as aware of that as anybody: we have a long history of advocating for the extension of the privacy laws to the private sector. I would like to see it happen quickly, and that is why I supported the Labor Party's moves to bring forward the implementation of this legislation. But I am beginning to wonder if it is worth passing this legislation with its many flaws and loopholes, particularly in relation to the political parties exemption and the employee records. </para><para>I congratulate the ALP on their work in relation to the child protection measures and I take on board the fact that, my goodness, if Reagan could do it so many years ago, I am sure that it will not be too hard for this government, in the 21st century, to resolve that issue. I acknowledge that Senator Bolkus has an undertaking from the governmentâcertainly in the message before usâto pursue some of these issues. But it is all in the legislation as it stands now: let us pass it in this form, let us insist that it gets passed in this form, so that it is not full of these exemptions. </para><para>Obviously I record my personal disappointment, which I have no doubt is shared by some others, that this chance to legislate for genetic privacy, this opportunity for the government to lead the way, has been missed by the government. We talk about Bush and Reagan getting it right 12 or 13 years ago. It is not often that I find myself agreeing with George W., but even he made genetic privacy an issue in the recent American election campaign. Even he pledged to introduce legislation that would outlaw the abuse of genetic privacy and genetic discrimination in America, although he probably does not have as much work to do as this government has, because most American jurisdictions, most of the states, have implemented some form of genetic privacy or non-discrimination legislation. I was really hoping that this would be an opportunity for the government to show that it is trying to be a world leader in the area of privacy protection, specifically in relation to people's unique and sensitive genetic information. </para><para>I do not abide by the argument that has been proffered today by the government in the form of explanation on the amendments that health information or other personal information will cover this, because clearly it does not. We only have to look at the evidence provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee inquiry into this matter. Genetic information is different. Apart from the fact that the insurance companies might tell you otherwise, there were a great majority of witnessesâprivacy experts, consumer representatives and health expertsâwho were prepared to put very much on record that genetic privacy and genetic information is different from general personal and health information. This legislation has finally been amended to reflect that. The Democrat amendments, which were supported by the Labor Party, and I thank them for that, reflected the fact that this is an issue with which we have to contend. I know there is a government inquiry and I know it was announced, unfortunately, after the first cases of genetic discrimination were revealed in Australia; not that that was really a big surprise. Anyone who has been following this debate either in Australia or internationally would understand that it was only a matter of time before people were discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. </para><para>There is an inquiry under way, and I have congratulated the government on and I welcome that belated inquiry into these issues. But when are we going to get something in law, something that protects people against their genetic information being used against them, something that says to Australians, `We actually do care about your most unique and sensitive personal information and we are going to put something in law now to protect those rights'? There is no justification put forward by this government that really provides any rationale for the rejection of those amendments. It is one thing to say, okay, it is sort of covered of by this, or, yes, we have got an inquiry coming up that will resolve this once and for all. What about in current law? There is nothing that guarantees in an enforceable way on a national levelâor at state and territory level, for that matterâthat people will not be discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. I was quite happy for the government to claim credit and say that they were trying to be world leaders, or at least catch up with some parliaments or jurisdictions in the world and say, `Yes, we are going to take advantage of this opportunity and ensure that we can give Australians some confidence that this information is protected.' For that reason alone, I would like to see the amendments insisted upon.  </para><para>Clearly that is one component of a national enforceable privacy regime and there are other key and important components. All those components I think were covered by some of the amendments that have been rejected today, and that is why I am beginning to wonder whether it is worth implementing this legislation at all. It is one thing for it to be tardy; it is another thing for it to be completely full of loopholes and deficiencies. There are significant deficiencies, and it is not just the Australian Democrats arguing that: it is everyone from the Privacy Foundation through to the Consumers Association. I have yet to hear anything from the Privacy Commissioner or anyone in a position of trust such as that that actually endorses the broad ranging political party exemption. I have yet to hear a rationale from government, or from opposition, for that matter, for why political parties and organisations should be exempt from these laws. When we have a review into this legislation, as we will in a couple of years, if there is a case for political organisations and parties being exempt then we will hear it and the government can accommodate it with the legislation. But how, particularly at a time when politicians are probably held in the lowest esteem ever in this nation's history, can we be hypocritical enough to be voting in favour of legislation that we are not going to abide by ourselves? I think that stinks, and I think the Australian public will think so too. </para><para>So I am disappointed at a time that should be an exciting time marking the delayed, belated passage of legislation that finally extends privacy legislation to the private sector, as the Democrats' private member's bill would have done back in 1997 or Michael Macklin's amendments back in 1988. Finally we get to the point where we are about to pass this law. We have improved it with some of the amendments that were moved and passed in the debate in the chamber last week, yet the government has rejected some of those key amendments. The Democrats believe that these amendments should be insisted upon. We urge the ALP to reconsider its position. They were amendments that were hard fought for during the debate. Senator Bolkus gave good reasons for moving those amendments and supporting them. I hope that we do not see the government's backflip on privacy reflected in an ALP backflip. So let us make this legislation stronger than it is. We have waited long enoughâlet us get it right. Let us insist on these amendments and make it a better bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>20911</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am fascinated to be here, and I must say I am stunned to be part of the debate in which the ALP and Democrats are exhorting us to follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush. We are more than happy to be following them in many respects, and I will remember those comments for some time to come and in future debates. I am pleased to hear you can be so generous towards two gentlemen who were great presidents of the United States. I say in passing that I must reject the very shameful and unfortunate attack on Australia's Attorney-General by Senator Bolkus. If there is anything that our Attorney-General should be widely regarded and praised for, it is his respect for civil liberties. He is well known throughout this nation as a man who strongly defends individual and civil liberties. It is something of which he can be proud, and we are proud to have such a man in our government.</para></talk.start><para>For Labor to attack us on that ground really is extraordinary, given their 13 years of shameful government when they paid no regard to these sorts of matters. Indeed, that was highlighted by a legislative matter that Senator Bolkus himself was responsible forâthe infamous Australia card, which was a matter of great shame for the then Labor government and Senator Bolkus. It was one of his many failures; of course, he could not even get that through. I do not want to prolong the debate, but I do have to make those remarks in response to the comments made. Nevertheless, in a spirit of generosity I say that we are appreciative that we do have a resolution of this matter in a way that will enable this legislation to be passed in this session. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.M.

But I do think it is appropriate to place on the record some of the substance of the issues because it is a matter that the Democratsâand I am sure all people in this placeâdo take seriously and do believe is important. To assist those who are listening or trying to follow the debate, what we are dealing with again is an amendment to veterans' affairs legislation. The initial bill sought to extend entitlements to a number of veterans who had not previously received those entitlements. It sought to extend those entitlements to service personnel from a range of conflicts, particularly in the South-East Asian area, through the 1950s and 1960s. Those are measures that all in this chamber support. What the chamber did was add an extra group of peopleâthe civilian surgical and medical teams from Vietnamâinto that category of people who should be recognised and should also receive the veterans' entitlements. Basically, that has been the matter of dispute at hand. I think this is the third time we are dealing with it.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst some of these points have been made before, the issue of serving Australia in a theatre of war is of such importance that I think it should be acknowledged every time we have the opportunity to discuss issues like this in the chamber. There is no doubt that war impacts not just on veterans but also on their families. This is not just about entitlements for returned personnel; it is also about their families. When we talk about personnel who have returned from Vietnam, as we are currently, we must remember that there is a higher incidence of cleft palate and cleft lip among Vietnam veterans' children than among those in the general community. Vietnam veterans' children also have three times the suicide rate that would be expected and a significantly higher death rate from illness and accident than that of the general community. That is a matter of established fact. The Veterans' Entitlements Act also contains certain facilities for veterans' families.  </para><para>Another part of this legislation seeks to increase what is available to the children of Vietnam veterans arising out of the results of the Vietnam veterans' health study. Whilst one could be a bit critical about how long it took for that extra assistance to be provided, nonetheless the government should be congratulated on doing so. That is the theme behind a lot of the actions the government has taken in terms of extending assistance for Vietnam veterans and the recognition of those special problems that have beset people who have returned from service. I do not know, and I am not sure anyone absolutely knows for sure, what the causal relationship is between service in Vietnam and the higher incidence of certain conditions such as those I have mentioned, as well as the higher incidence of certain conditions in the children of veterans, but I think we can guarantee that, whatever the causal relationship is between service in Vietnam and this higher incidence of certain conditions, it is not related to whether or not the people in Vietnam were under the Department of Defence or the Department of External Affairs.</para><para>The government is arguing on a technicality. The people who are affected are being treated differently because of that technicality. The work they did was the same. In many cases the dangers were the same, if not greater, for some than others. It is purely the technicality that they performed that service for Australiaâand, indeed, for the Vietnameseâwhilst in the employ and under the direction of the Department of External Affairs, rather than the Department of Defence. </para><para>Those who served in the Australian civilian surgical and medical teams during the Vietnam War and who are suffering conditions as a result of that deserve better treatment than they are getting. There is clearly an argument that Comcare is not the suitable agency and that the Safety and Rehabilitation Act is not the right legislation to deal with the medical teams. Their conditions are as war-related as the conditions of other Vietnam veterans. That is why we have a special system established for those veterans. </para><para>However, if the Senate is going to continue to support this amendment in this chamber, then we are faced with the prospect in the House of Representatives that the coalition is going to at least delay, if not scuttle, the entire legislation, which is positive legislation which will benefit a significant number of veterans. If that were to be the outcome, then the nurses and civilian medical personnel would obviously miss out. A number of other veterans who, as a result of the Mohr review recommendations, are to receive access to repatriation benefits would also miss out. It would also delay the initiatives directed at the health of Vietnam veterans' children. It is clearly not the Democrats' desire to see this happen in some sort of game of political chicken. We are very disappointed that the government refuses to acknowledge the justice of this situation and is hiding behind a technicality. </para><para>So we are faced with the lesser evil in the face of the government's intransigence as to whether we should not insist on this amendment so that at least some people will receive the extra entitlements that they, quite rightly, should. The medical teams for now will still miss out, but the long overdue access to repatriation benefits for veterans arising out of the Mohr review will go ahead as scheduled on 1 January 2001, which, as many veterans have pointed out, is still too long to have waitedâin some cases 45 years. It is certainly not the Democrats' desire to make them wait any longer. </para><para>I note that in one of the debates in the House of Representatives on this legislation and the amendment at issue, Minister Scott said that he will meet with representatives of civilian medical teams who served in the Vietnam War. The Democrats will certainly be monitoring the negotiations between the minister and that group of people. If a satisfactory outcome is not reached, then we will certainly either move or support an amendment such as this being moved again at a future time to other veterans' legislation. When a future piece of legislation relating to veterans' entitlements or to the Veteran's Affairs Act that is not so obviously and tangibly beneficial to veterans is introduced, the Democrats are certainly not likely to give the government a third chance to get this right. We will pursue this issue again if the minister's negotiations with the civilian medical personnel do not reach a satisfactory conclusion.  </para><para>I would particularly like to acknowledge the positive stance that the ALP, and Senator Schacht in particular, have taken and pledge the Democrats' commitment to support better recognition and appropriate access to repatriation benefits in the future. Part of the special obligation we owe to veterans is to remember our history. I hope that the debate that has occurred in this place and in the media about the nurses has heightened the awareness amongst the Australian community, or parts of it, about the nurses' contribution in Vietnamânot just for Australia but for the Vietnamese people. In terms of remembering history, certainly the Democrats will not pass this bill and then be glad it is out of the way and forget all about it. We will continue to monitor this issue, as I am sure Senator Schacht will. If, I am sure, the genuine efforts of the minister to address the definitely genuine concerns and needs of the medical personnel are not adequately addressed by future negotiations, then I can certainly guarantee that history will repeat itself and we will be revisiting this issue at a later date. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>20914</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to express the opposition's view on this now third occasion that we have debated the <inline ref="R1108">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000</inline> in the last week or so. I, like Senator Bartlett, am very disappointed that the government would not accept the recommendation of their own independent review, the Mohr report, which they commissioned under pressure last year from the veterans' community and us and others in the community. The only recommendation not being picked up is to give veterans' entitlements to the civilian surgical teamsâ410 or 411 people. The government says it is their estimate that it would cost an extra $3.5 million to give these people access to veterans' entitlements. I think that is a small amount of money, but I know the bean counters in Finance would probably disagree and have told the minister, `You can't have the money. Bad luckâwe are not going to give it.' </para></talk.start><para>I appreciate, as Senator Bartlett has explained, that the opposition is put in the position that all the other recommendations are covered in the bill which we have strenuously and strongly supported. But if this bill lapses or sits on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> until next year, past 1 January, those other very deserving Vietnam veterans and their families, the naval people who served in the Malayan Emergency and the other service groups who served from 1955 to 1975, would not get access. </para><para>I am careful how I say this, but it has to be said. The government have whipped up a mini fear campaign in the veterans' community in the last week. They have played political blackmail by telling veterans, `It is the opposition's and the Democrats' fault that you will not get your benefits, because they are delaying the bill with this amendment.' They did not tell the veterans' community that the amendment we are moving is in line with the Mohr committee that recommended all the other benefits. The government did not bother to explain that to concerned veterans who were caught up in the fear campaign around the place. </para><para>After the amendment was first put in this place it was almost as though, within about half an hour of the minister's advisers getting back to his office, the phone started ringing and emails started arriving. You can see the campaign of the minister and the government's advisers: `Tell all those Vietnam veterans, the naval people from the Far Eastern Strategic Reserve and the RAAF people from Ubon that they are going to lose the lot because the opposition is holding up the legislation.' They did not tell them that the opposition were holding it up to put in an amendment to accept the Mohr recommendations. When we explained to the people who rang or emailed us that we were carrying out the full recommendations of the Mohr report to gave them their benefitsâand what were we supposed to do?âthey said, `We now see a different story.'  </para><para>In my view, the government played a disgraceful campaign of blackmail on the opposition and the Democrats which created a fear campaign in the veterans community. I have said before here and at estimates and at various veterans organisations that, as shadow minister, I am not interested in playing a partisan party political game about veterans issues. The veterans deserve better than that in this parliament. Every veterans issue should be dealt with on the basis of what is best for the veterans and not what is best for the political opportunism of any political party that can point score. I have to say that, by and large, the veteran community is positive about the way their issues are being dealt with. This is the first occasion, I have to say, that I have found the government partisan in the way it has dealt with veterans issues since I have been shadow minister. On that, I am extremely disappointed and I will be saying my piece on that point to veterans organisations over the intermediate future. I still stick with the principled position that we in the opposition will not play party politics on veterans' entitlements. We will do what we think is best for the veterans community. </para><para>People might ask: `Now that the matter is defeated, what will you do with the issue of the nurses and doctors from the civilian surgical teams?' We, like the Democrats, if there is an opportunity during the next 12 months on another bill that does not have benefits tied to it but is a technical bill, will look again at amending the Veterans' Entitlements Act to get this matter dealt with and completed in accordance with the Mohr report. But if that does not work and if the government have not fixed this position by the time of the next election, we will revisit this issue in government when we win the next election. I, like all other shadow ministers, will not make an irresponsible promise about a commitment of money before the shadow ministry knows what the fiscal position is after the next budget leading up to the next election. It will certainly be my positionâsubject to the fiscal positionâto argue very strongly that, in accordance with the Mohr report, the surgical team should get these benefits. I have to say that the $3.5 million estimate may be a rather generous estimate to jack the figure up, making it look even more costly. I do not think it would be that high. It is not a large amount of money, but I can assure the nurses, the doctors and the veterans community that we will revisit this issue as a matter of priority when we win the next election. That is a commitment they would expect us to make in view of what we have said in this chamber in debating the Mohr recommendations.</para><para>I, like Senator Bartlett, am interested to hear that the minister wants to talk to the nurses and doctors about ways in which they can get improved benefits under Comcare. I welcome any time a minister who wants to talk to the public or a group who have an issue. That is fine. But I have to say with some incredulity that I really do not expect the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Scott, to proceed to amend the Comcare act so as to overcome some of its difficulties and limitations which have prevented the nurses and doctors and other staff getting what they should. The reason they want to be under the Veterans' Entitlement Act is simple: the range of benefits is better. For example, the Comcare benefit runs out at 65âyou do not get it past 65âwhereas under the Veterans' Entitlements Act you can get it until you die. Under the Comcare act, you have to report to and be reassessed by Comcare regularly. Whether it is for a physical complaint or a disability, you still have to continue. Under the Veterans' Entitlement Act, the first time your disability is accepted, it is accepted for the rest of your life. Those are two extremely important differences. The parliamentary secretary tried to make the point that we did not understand that you do not get a lump sum under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âThat's right. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âI knew that. But why do you think they want to get the other benefits? Because those benefits are better than even some lump sumâa lump sum that they are still not getting when they apply for it. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, the range of care available for people as they get older is much superior to what they can get under Comcare. I have to say I take it with a very big pinch of salt that this minister will convince another minister to amend the Comcare act to give better benefits to the nurses and others in the units. But any talk is better than nothing and I am sure that the Nursing Federation, on behalf of its members and retired members, will be happy to have those discussions. We look forward to seeing what they are.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, it is with great regret that the opposition, like the Democrats, will not insist on its amendment on this occasion. We went twice to the well. We thought that the government might have had some modicum of decency to accept the recommendation of its own inquiry, but no. We hoped that there might have been some sense of reasonableness, since this was not a large ask on the budgetâit is a very small askâand that the government might have gone back and again seen the evidence that the nurses gave to both the Mohr committee and the Senate committee when it dealt with this legislation. The nurses and others in these units have certainly suffered from their service in Vietnam. But no, the government is unbending. It is no, no, no from this government.</para><para>That is to the shame of this government. I hope we get a chance to have another go at this on some other piece of legislation before the next election. If not, I look forward to having a Labor government deal with this matter again after the next election to give these veterans from the civilian surgical units the entitlement which they are certainly due.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>20916</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak briefly on the motion on the <inline ref="R1108">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000</inline> because I took part in the inquiry on the legislation. As Senator Schacht said here this afternoon, it is very disappointing that the government has taken this approach. These peopleânurses, doctors and radiographersâwho served under quite difficult circumstances in Vietnam and have a range of ongoing health problems arising specifically out of that service in Vietnam where they did have a price upon their head now find themselves left to the negotiation process with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who, as I understand, will undertake to try to extend some entitlements to them.</para></talk.start><para>But the fact was that they do have a very compelling case indeed. They do have needs that were identified, needs that were addressed in the Mohr report, as has already been pointed out, and it seems unfortunate that their ongoing health needs and health care are now subject to whatever negotiations might take place over the next 12 months. In my view, 12 months is too long. Now is the time to act. Unfortunately this government has not shown any sense of sympathy for these people. One knows that there has been an argument floating around, and maybe quite rightly so, that they were not part of the military forces as such. I am sure that, when that was consideredâit was considered well in the Mohr reportâthese people are a `special circumstances' special case indeed. It seems to me that it is a sad day when these people who have such a compelling case are being pushed to one side.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>20916</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTo sum up this debate, I thank the Democrats and the Labor Party for changing their position in relation to this particular vote.

We were told in previous debates that that was not the case. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âDon't stretch the truth, Eric.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âI am being told by interjection that I am stretching the truth. Well, I happened to be at a Vietnam Veterans Association function to which I had been invited and I sat next to the national president, Brian McKenzie. If you are trying to assert that I am stretching the truth, let me simply say to you that the Vietnam veterans at that function were very supportive of the government's position and understood the reason. The reason is simply this: the principle under which we have operated has been that the Veterans' Entitlements Act ought be the preserve and domain of veterans. That is the government's position. I might add that it has been the position of governments of all persuasions up until this time that the Veterans' Entitlements Act ought be for the benefit of veterans. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Those listening in to this debate will find it amazing that an argument is being made that veterans' entitlements should be extended to non-veterans. But, just in case anybody is listening to this debate and thinks that these people who served in Vietnam were not covered, let me say that they are wrong. I can thank the Vietnam veteran community for delivering some documents to me which point out quite clearly what the civilian medical teams in fact received. They got a letter which said, amongst other things:</para><quote><para>You are asked to take note that the usual Commonwealth Public Service conditions in respect of sickness and sick leave apply. </para></quote><para>Later it said:</para><quote><para>In Viet Nam you will come under the general jurisdiction of the Australian Ambassador in Saigon. </para></quote><para>Before they left, they were asked to sign a contract in which clause 9 was headed `Compensation'. So, before they left Australia, the civilian teams were told by letter of their sick leave and other benefits that they would be entitled to and also, under the contract they signed, what the terms and conditions were. They went with their eyes open. They knew what the terms and conditions were. Under `Compensation', (ix), the contract said:</para><quote><para>The employee will, from the date of commencement of service, be covered by the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act as amended from time to time.</para></quote><para>The fact that I was given this documentation by somebody within the Vietnam veterans community as a result of discussions on Saturday night at this Vietnam veterans function is indicative that some of the assertions made by Senator Schacht in the previous weeks about these entitlements were not as supported by the Vietnam veterans community as he in fact asserted. In relation to the Mohr report, we have had this discussion a number of times, and mere repetition does not obviate the need for some substance to the argument. At the Vietnam veterans dinner, a number of the Vietnam veterans said, to use the technical term, `Well, the judge stuffed up, didn't he?' We say that he went beyond the terms of reference. The terms of reference clearly spelt out that the judge had to consider the benefits and entitlements of members of the Australian defence forces. Unfortunately His Honour, for undoubtedly the best of reasons, strayed from the terms of reference and then made a recommendation which in fact was contradictory to what he asserted at page XLII. The Vietnam veterans community understand that. They use the term `stuffed up'; we use the term that he in fact went beyond the terms of reference and made contradictory comments in his report. I would have thought that somebody like Senator Schacht might have been able to understand that situation.</para><para>The argument very clearly is this: if you do extend the Veterans' Entitlements Act to non-veterans, where would you draw the line? Senator Hogg said in his contribution that members of the civilian medical teams had prices on their heads. Yes, absolutely right. But so did the civilian Qantas pilots that flew soldiers into Vietnam. So did the ambassadorial staff. So did the civilian contractors who assisted with the mechanical work required to assist the bulldozers and other equipment in Vietnam. If you apply it to one group of civilians that were assisting the war effort in Vietnam, why would you not extend it to other civilian groups who also assisted in Vietnam?</para><para>With what now appears ever growing support from the veterans community, we are quite rightly saying the Veterans' Entitlements Act ought to be the preserve and the domain of the veterans and those who came under the direct control of the Australian defence forces. The civilian medical teams clearly came under the general jurisdiction of the Australian ambassador in Saigon and not under the control of the Australian defence forces. We have taken a stand on this legislation which I believe is principled. It is fair. It is impossible for the opposition to try to dress this up as being some mean-spirited approach by government when you consider the huge range of benefits that we are now making available to the Vietnam veteran community, which includes Vietnam veterans, spouses, former spouses and their childrenâand the Labor Party had the opportunity to deal with this for 13 years and did not. The huge package that we are delivering in this legislation cannot be described as mean spirited. In fact it is a very generous scheme. Let me simply say that I would agree with what I think Senator Schacht said: not before time. It is a regret that it has taken us some four years to get it in. But at least we commissioned the study. At least we did deliver. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âUnder pressure.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âWell, after 13 years what did the Australian Labor Party have to show?

They were given no proper briefing about where they were going to, who they were going to serve and what the conditions were. They were led to believe they were going to something similar to the hospital from which they cameâa well-provisioned regional hospital. Where did they find themselves? Not based in Saigon like some of the other civilians, including the diplomat. They found themselves in the provinces, as Dot Angell said in her evidence, in appalling conditions. The hospital was built for five or six patients but had 30 patients, two and three to a bed. There was no proper equipment and no medicines. The nurses were not just there for the odd day but for months on end with no leave, yet you tell me that they were not making a commitment and you quote a letter that they signed to say that they accepted that they have no entitlements other than what is available under the Commonwealth Service Act. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Having the immorality to make the decision to send Australians to Vietnam for the wrong reasons and then getting up and saying, `They signed it,' is typical of the Liberal Party. It was typical in the sixties and the seventies: `Sign a letter or, if you are unlucky enough to be drawn in the ballot, we'll conscript you and, whether you like it or not, you'll end up in Vietnam.' There were 500 who did not come back from Vietnam, and a number of those were conscripts. Many thousands more were injured and many thousands more are still suffering in various ways as a result of their service in Vietnam. Although the Labor Party strongly opposed that involvement, we have never denied that those who served in Vietnam are entitled to the full and generous benefit as veterans. We have never equivocated on that position.</para><para>You mentioned that I may have misled the Senate, or you inferred I may have misled or given a variation about what the Vietnam veterans organisations were saying. My previous remarks are on the record. A resolution was carried that the Vietnam Veterans Association had no objection to the surgical unit members getting benefits so long as the other benefits were not put at risk. The way you put it was as though they objected outright to the nurses having the benefits. The way it was written was, `We don't have any objection to it so long as our benefits aren't put at risk.' That is quite a distinction from what you said when you implied that I misled the Senate.</para><para>Secondly, the Vietnam Veterans Federation, another organisation that represents veterans' interests, has made it clear that it supports the nurses. Individual Vietnam veterans I have spoken to support the Mohr recommendations. And why wouldn't they, because the Mohr recommendations supported all of them? It would be hypocritical for people to say, `We accept all of Mohr's recommendations for us, but we're not going to accept it for the nurses.' I have never heard any Vietnam veteran say that they do not accept that the nurses should get the recommendation as laid down in the Mohr report. I agree with the parliamentary secretary that the RSL have said that their position is that, unless you are under direct military command, you are not entitled to coverage by the Veterans' Entitlement Act. That is their position, and I knew that. I have never said anything else. I acknowledged that in the opening of this debate last week.</para><para>I will conclude by saying that I find it a bit rich that the minister of a political party that sent people to Vietnam and got us entangled in that dreadful war that is still having consequences for the health of tens of thousands of Australians should get up and read a letter that they got people who volunteered to go to sign.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âNo, who volunteered to go.

There is no escaping the many concerns about the unfair, unprofessional and substandard legislation designed to underpin this program. The opposition shares with all taxpayers a contempt for politicians who bestow taxpayers' money as if it is their own to give. As a result, the amendment before the Senate today, circulated in my name, condemns the government for that very approach. </para></talk.start><para>This government is condemned for failing to compensate motorists for higher fuel prices as a result of the GST, in spite of their promises. This government is condemned for having no national strategy for infrastructure development, leaving major transport and other infrastructure projects and opportunities untapped or not determined in a fair and transparent way. This government is condemned for a program that does not respect the infrastructure priorities of local government in their communities. The government has pushed the money out into one transport modeâone infrastructure style in a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with very diverse infrastructure needs. This government is condemned for five years of neglect of regional infrastructure and development. Most importantly, this government is condemned for the lack of transparency that surrounds the distribution of the $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money that is funding this package. </para><para>Without a doubt, this bill has great pork-barrelling potential. If this package is as fair, equitable, generous and flawless as the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government infer, why have its presentation and preparation been so sloppy, slapdash and deceptive? We were told that councils will receive quarterly funding in advance but that the minister will have discretion over when in the four years the funding will be allocated. In other words, the minister can time his announcements to suit the political preferences of the government. This government are known for ensuring total political discretion on major infrastructure projectsâit is a bit like their timing for the Sydney Orbital and the Speedrail, maybe. </para><para>This government says that we, the Labor Party, cannot complain about how the funding has been allocated between electorates, because, Minister Anderson asserted, it was Labor's formula.

This was another blatant misleading from this government. A Senate estimates hearing last Friday at last exposed the truth about the formula used to distribute moneys under the Roads to Recovery Program. Not surprisingly, the position at Senate estimates was at total odds with the situation portrayed by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister. During the hearings, Minister Macdonald, representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, admitted that the formula used to distribute the funds was totally new and bore no relation to past formulas used to distribute funds to local government. In answer to my direct questionâ`Is it a new formula?'âMinister Macdonald said yes. Uncharacteristically, we got a response from this minister. You really cannot get more emphatic than that. It is a totally new formula that has no resemblance to the original 1991 formula that was produced under the then Labor government.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>I also asked Senator Macdonald how this new formula worked, and this is where the real extent of the government's fiddling with the formulaâin terms of our contentionâwas exposed. Minister Macdonald stated that the interstate distribution of funds was based on a formula involving 50 per cent road length and 50 per cent population, or per capita. So far so good; we can all understand that. But there was another variable on top of that. He then admitted that the formula was, and I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, `adjusted to get a fair and equitable result'. When I pressed him further about the basis for these adjustments that he mentioned, he would say only that they were undertaken by the government, that it was a government decision, and that it was at the discretion of the government. This was confirmed by the public servants who were at the table. So we still do not know what variables were used, other than the 50 per cent road length and 50 per cent per capita variables, to distribute on an interstate basis. I would welcome the opportunity in the committee stage for that to be clarified, because we have not got the answer from Minister Anderson either.</para><para>Despite repeated questioning, this minister simply refused to provide any details on how this `fair and equitable result' was calculated. He just plain refused. So here we have a minister freely admitting that the government has simply `adjusted' the various interstate funding levels at its own discretion and refusing in the estimates process to provide the parliament, and therefore the taxpayers of this country, with the details necessary to make an objective decision on whether there is capacity for pork-barrelling or not in relation to this package. It is very difficult, I have to say, to come to any other conclusion than that the government is trying to hide something. Minister Macdonald's fairly inept displays last Friday in obfuscating and not answering questionsâsomething which we have come to expectâsimply confirmed and highlighted that fact. He did not do the government any favours, I would have to say.</para><para>We believe that the government has to come clean and reveal how the final funding distributions were arrived at. Minister Macdonald's efforts at Senate estimates hearings last week to hide the real formula do nothing but cast serious doubt over the whole process, and the onus is on this government to come clean, for the sake of local government, local communities and the taxpayers of Australia, and to let us know. If there is nothing to hide, why not let us know?</para><para>The minister and Minister Anderson say that any accusation by the Labor Party that this package favours coalition seats is an outrageous assertion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âIt is.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âI see Senator McGauran vehemently agreeing with this. When you look at it, every one of the top 17 seats that received $25 million is held by government members. Let us take the Northern Territory, for example. I would have thought that the Northern Territory would be a territory which would have attracted more funding under the 1991 distribution, but they in fact got a cut of two per cent. There are a small number of people in the Northern Territory, so that can be explained in relation to the per capita thing. We still do not know the definition in relation to road length. But, in terms of the allocating of the pie, they got less than they would have in the 1991 allocation under the then Labor government. So what about the Northern Territory? One can only construe that there is a Labor member in the Northern Territory. Let us move to the seat of Capricornia, which is as big as any other seat in Queensland. It did not make it into the top 17. Why was that?

We already have what is known as the `Roads of National Party Importance Program', a program that is not known for its transparency, and now we have the `Roads to National Party Recovery'. The Howard government is quick to cry foul when people question the word of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, but now everyone will have to question the honesty of this government, because the 17 top electorates are all government electorates. No wonder this government refuses to publicly release the full formula in terms of the allocation. The government cannot release it because it will show that there are discrepancies in relation to the allocation. How quick was John Howard to come out and say, `This is not a pork-barrelling exercise'? Minister Anderson came outâhand on heartâand said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This will not favour coalition seats.</para></quote><para>That is a quote. I do not know what you would call the top 17 receiving $25 million or more, if not favouring coalition seats. I would hate to see a scheme that totally favoured coalition seats, if this is the story. </para><para>This desperate government has been exposed. Whether those on the other side of the chamber like this or not, the reality is that this government is not trusted by people in regional Australia. The government stubbornly claimsâand Mr Costello has continually maintained thisâthat there is no money to provide relief for the motorists at the petrol pump, and it then announces a $1.6 billion program for roads. What this program does not do is change the Prime Minister's broken promise on the price of petrol. Let us just reapprise ourselves of that promise. The Prime Minister said that the price of petrol would not increase as a result of the GST. Everybody in Australia knows about this promise and everybody in regional Australia knows that the Prime Minister has broken this promise. I defy any member of the coalition to go to the places I have been and say that the government has not broken that promise and see if they get out alive.</para><para>Who will be able to afford to drive on these roads? That is the big question. In the estimates on Friday, Senator Macdonald mentioned that he had done a major road trek right across Australia. It is just as well he does not have to pay for his petrol. These days, the ordinary motorist would not be able to afford to do that road trek. One of the things that emerged from the petrol inquiry was the issue of tourism in terms of the price of petrol in areas like Queensland, Western Australia and so on. We will see an economic downturn in the emergent tourist industry as a result. Local government is acutely aware of the Prime Minister's commitment that the GST would not increase the price of petrol. During our petrol inquiryâwhich we pursued, despite not being able to achieve the Senate numbers in relation to thisâlocal government representatives said that immediate relief on petrol was their number one priority. Many shires and councils have raised with me the damage being done to their local communities by soaring petrol prices. Unfortunately, the social fabric of communities is being damaged, as higher transport costs impact on everything from Meals on Wheels to junior sporting teamsâthe lot. That is the reality. Whether we like it or not, at this stage petrol is the lifeblood of regional Australia in terms of getting around. The really big question is: where is the rest of the money from the petrol windfall?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>âWhat petrol windfall?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âOn the Prime Minister's own figures, the windfall from the petrol tax increase is well over $730 million this financial year aloneâ$480 million in the resource rent tax increases and $250 million on the petroleum royalty side. On top of that, we have a major boost in revenue from the GST on petrol, which this government will not disclose. But there is a reason why the government will not disclose it. The government will not disclose it because it is a huge windfall in terms of the GST. Yet the Roads to Recovery Program announced by the Howard government is only $400 million this financial year. On the Prime Minister's own figuresâand I will take a bit of a punt that they might be on the conservative side in relation to windfallsâthis leaves at least $300 million. But, in reality, it is a lot more than that. In fact, we calculate and most credible organisations calculate that the Roads to Recovery package in total is about a quarter of the government's windfallâin its various guisesâresulting from increased tax on petrol. Increased funding for Australian roads is long overdue, but motorists are still looking for relief at the petrol pump, and the Howard government is nowhere in sight. Unfortunately, the real damage from high petrol prices is being ignored by the government. The government promised that the GST would not impact on the price of petrol, but it has. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has neglected living standards, infrastructure and services in regional Australia for the past five years, and people will now not be conned by this package. Local and regional communities know very well that the Howard government needs to put more than one road package on the table one year out from an election. Our second reading amendment calls on this government to act not only in terms of strategic infrastructure planning but also in terms of addressing the negative effect of the GST on fuel prices and the excise indexation adjustment due in February 2001. The Labor Party have suggested that, in relation to the next CPI adjustment in February, what should be done is that the impact of the GST should be removed from it. This would mean that the coalition had kept its promise. Our back-of-the-envelope calculationâand that is all it is because we cannot get the informationâis that it is about $660-odd million. The Prime Minister says, `It's only 2câit doesn't matter.' If you go out into regional Australia and say that, you would not get out of there alive. The rushed and amateurish way this bill was introduced into parliament is indicative of how Minister Anderson responded to community calls for some leadership in transport and infrastructure strategies and how he responded to the call for some backbone on fixing the Prime Minister's broken promise on petrol. This is a panic to knee-jerk response.</para><para>One of the more interesting subtexts to this whole process is the way this government has used local governmentâand they know it. Having spent some time at the ALGA, they are only too aware of what has happened. This government's approach has been to ignore local government. Its approachâand this minister's approachâhas been very much like the old adage about children: they should be seen and not heard. On Monday, at the ALGA general assembly, the Prime Minister made the following fairly bold statement:</para><quote><para>The old idea that local government was purely a creature of state government and dealt only with state governments is of course an outworn notion. We might differ as between the federal government and your associationâ</para></quote><para>that is, the ALGAâ</para><quote><para>about such things as constitutional recognition.</para></quote><para>I think `differ' is probably a mild way to put it. He goes on:</para><quote><para>But there can be no doubt that we in the federal government believe that there is a lively and active and very productive direct relationship between the federal government and local government.</para></quote><para>This certainly does not gel with the position that has been put time and time again by the coalition, by the current minister and by the previous minister about how local government is merely a creature of the states. In April this year, the former minister for local government Mr Alex Somlyay made the clear statement that local government is a creature of the states. He is not the only one; everybody has said it.</para><para>There still seems to be a lot of confusion in coalition ranks about what their position on local government is. There are a couple of examples worth quoting. First of all, as we all know, the coalition government have vacated the field in terms of regional development as a Commonwealth responsibility. Minister Sharp said it up frontâin the first yearâand also abolished the Office of Regional Development. Before the arrangement with the Democrats on the GST package in 1999 to retain a direct financial link between the Commonwealth and local governmentâand I congratulate the Democrats for thatâthe Howard government were desperate to give the states total responsibility for local government assistance. They wanted to give the states all the responsibility for financial assistance grants, including the roads component. This included, as I said, ironically, the roads component which they have now used as a basisâa very loose basisâin terms of the distribution. What has changed since then? I think a few state governments have changed since then, which may underpin the decision. All of a sudden, the states are the common enemy for the Commonwealth and local governments. This damascene revelation has only really occurred in the last year or so. If that had proceeded, in terms of punting off financial assistance grants to the states, it would have broken a very strong historical nexus between the federal government and local government. However, the nexus is retained and, as I said, we congratulate the Democrats for that. The shrinking amount of funding available to councils is having a very detrimental effect and I can go on and on, but I will not because time does not permit me. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âSenator Macdonald, I will probably continue this in the committee stage of the bill. However, by not addressing the broader issue of the financial relationship, the minister has missed an opportunity to provide local government with an opportunity to discuss the Commonwealth-local government financial nexus and how that may operate into the next century. Local government continue to raise the ongoing claims in relation to the GST and its impactânot with this minister, but it has certainly been raised a lot of times with me.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, there is no doubt that the Roads to Recovery Program is a beginning in addressing the serious shortfall in road funding. The Labor Party are not opposing the bill but, as I have highlighted, we have a number of concerns. They were articulated at the ALGA by our leader, Kim Beazley, who got a very warm reception. I would like to put my thanks on record at this point to president John Ross for the very kind words he had to say about Kim Beazley and about my work.

Australia's rural and regional road infrastructure has been neglected for many years and, despite some rural areas experiencing a decline in population and, subsequently, a decline in ratepayers, many rural roads are used by non-residents for tourism and general transport purposes. That is certainly very much the case in my home state, as you might agree, Madam Acting Deputy President. This fact has already been recognised in part by the selection criteria under the Roads of National Importance Program, which determines such roads as promoting regional and national development, encouraging interregional and international trade in goods and services, and maximising transport efficiency and reliability. The state of some country roads is deplorable, and I am sure that many senators have heard stories of rural councils, unable to afford the costs of maintenance, that have taken the step of returning existing tarred road to dirt in an effort to reduce costs. That is an unacceptable situation. Whilst the Democrats seek to actively promote and encourage the use of public and non-polluting transport, we recognise that spending on improved roads also pays dividends in terms of safety, increased fuel efficiency and reduced driver frustration levels.</para></talk.start><para>My colleague Senator Andrew Bartlett recently related the story of a meeting with some Townsville business and community groups who expressed real despair at the number of unnecessary fatal and other accidents caused by people trying to overtake trucks and caravans on the Pacific Highway in that region. I suspect that is a scenario that the minister is familiar with too. I realise that the Pacific Highway is funded under the national highway system but I would draw the minister's attention to this particular black spot and call on the government to construct sufficient overtaking lanes so that holiday-makers, in particular, semitrailers and other road users can more safely share this road. </para><para>There is a vital need for communities to have a greater role in the planning of transport infrastructure, and we believe that there should be more extensive public consultation mechanisms in the planning and development processes. The fact that the money from this bill will go directly to local government authorities should mean that communities will have a greater say in how and where the money is spent, so in part it fits in with our policy in this regard. Moneys not spent will be repayable to the CommonwealthâI cannot see a lot of that happeningâand the audit processes will assist in ensuring that the money is spent where it is most needed and that tenders that are called for will represent the best use of taxpayers' money.</para><para>It is not simply the roads that are in need of urgent maintenance. Many bridges in rural and regional Australia are also in a terrible state of disrepair, and it is pleasing to see that bridges, as well as vehicular ferries and bicycle paths, it should be noted, are also included in the definition in this bill of `roads' and are therefore open to accessing those funds. Vehicular ferries are usually maintained by councils and are extremely expensive to operate. Frequently, there are squabbles between local government areas on either side of a river as to how much they should be contributing towards the upkeep of the ferries, and it is to be hoped that vehicular ferries too will benefit from this legislation. I am aware of some local governments that have had to cut down on ferry services and even take them out of operation altogether due to the high cost of such maintenance.</para><para>We are particularly pleased to see that bicycle paths now also qualify for funding under this bill. It is to be hoped that local governments with sound road infrastructureâin many cases that would be in city and inner city circumstancesâgive serious consideration to spending part of their allocated budget on introducing and/or upgrading bicycle paths. The New South Wales Democrats, in particular, have been campaigning for some years to expand the bike path network in New South Wales. This is a proposal supported by various bicycle institutes around the country and it makes a lot of sense. Placing bicycle paths alongside railway easements, where that is practical, is an excellent idea, as the land is already owned by the public; land acquisition costs are theoretically nil in those circumstances. All we need are cooperative state governments prepared to move the railway safety fence inward by a couple of metres and that option becomes a realistic one.</para><para>The gradients alongside railway lines mean that these routes make excellent bike paths. Shopping centres and other local businesses are also located around stations, so for local journeysâand for schoolchildrenâsuch a network of bike paths would be a welcome addition. Such a network, combined with the efforts of local bush regeneration groups, could provide design, training and employment opportunities for TAFE colleges in their local area and provide the added bonus of keeping cars and bike riders completely separate. I invite and encourage both of the major parties here in the house to shamelessly poach this Democrat policy and promote it through their parties with a view to achieving more livable cities.</para><para>On the subject of railways, we Democrats believe that far more money should be spent on rail freight and public rail transport in order to relieve urban road congestion. Rail freight is more suited, of course, to the transport of bulk freight, such as grain, coal and containers, but for too long rail has been the poor relation of our transport network. There is a kind of chicken and egg aspect to attracting freight to rail: if rail were quicker, more businesses would choose to use it; the more businesses choose to use it, the cheaper it becomes.</para><para>The Rail, Tram and Bus Union issued a release a few days ago that criticised the Roads to Recovery package for widening the gap between the federal commitments to road and to rail modes and for costing many rail jobs, the vast majority of which have been in rural areas. The union further criticised the government for committing $250 million to rail over four years but for spending only $80 million thus far. The Democrats agree that, until the old steam age rail alignments are straightened out and the tracks upgraded, rail will continue to lose business to road transport. The RTBU support a $3 billion federal investment in the interstate mainline network. This expenditure has been recommended by the Australian Bureau of Transport Economics and endorsed by the House of Representatives standing committee on transport. </para><para>No fewer than three inquiries commissioned by the Howard government have found a cause for upgrading mainline tracks for faster and heavier freight trains. An option that the Australian Democrats would urge the government to consider would be to reinstate a structured program for federal funds for urban public transport improvements. In the United States, about 20 per cent of all federal transport funds go to mass transit. In Australia, almost all federal land transport funds go to roads at the expense of rail and urban public transport. We have a rail system that has been neglected by government and that operates on lines and gradients designed in the steam age, when speed was not the all important factor that it is today. It is vital to ensure that rail retains the capacity to take the pressure off our road system, and without increased expenditure this simply will not happen.</para><para>At the present time, the responseâparticularly of state governmentsâto deteriorating rail infrastructure is to take the soft option: lower the speed limit and declare the track fit for purpose. When roads deteriorated, imagine if the speed limit were lowered from 60 to 40 kilometres per hour, until cars were crawling along them at 20 kilometres per hour. Yet this is exactly what has happened on some of Australia's railways. The Commonwealth would argue that the states are responsible for railways and that the states should build and maintain them. Yet some state governments would probably prefer the Commonwealth government to provide a structured program of urban public transport funding. It could be argued that such a program would be wholly consistent with Commonwealth government policies relating to economic efficiency, social equity and environmental sustainability. In fact, section 51 (xxxiii) of the Constitution makes specific provision for this parliament to make laws in respect of conditional railway acquisition and construction, and section 51 (xxxiv) provides for the construction of railways and extension of railways in any state `with the consent of that State'. Yet the Constitution does not specifically mention roads at all.</para><para>Perhaps we would all be better off and be living in far more presentable cities if the Commonwealth provided for new underground rail and other rail augmentation and extension if such construction was conditional upon new suburbs being opened up. The Rouse Hill development sector in north-west Sydney is a classic example of bad planning policy. It is estimated that a population the size of Canberra will be living there by 2020, yet there are no fixed public transport links. A very real fear that the local Democrats in the area have is that the railway easements that would link this area to the rail network will be sold off for a quick dollar. Is it any wonder that so many of the new houses currently being built in that area have three-car garages?</para><para>Despite the additional funding for country roads, sooner or later we have to face up to the fact that we can only squeeze so many cars into a city until we have gridlock. What we need are preventive strategies designed to make public transport flexible and affordable. Commuters are angry about the fact that ticket prices seem to go up but without a commensurate increase in service quality. To hand over a $10 note, get a few coins in change and not even be guaranteed a seat clearly grates with many commuters, especially those who do not buy weekly tickets, and rail patronage in some areas has fallen as a result. Some of this roads money should be going to providing comfortable bus-rail interchanges and secure car parking around railway stations. If you are really serious about wanting to get people out of their cars, you had better give them a safe place to leave their cars while they catch the train or bus into town. Consequently, the Democrats will be moving an amendment to allow local governments to use their allocation to build such car parks at interchanges if that is what local communities identify as being appropriate for their community needs.  </para><para>Governments need to be more responsive to the needs of people. The reality is that people's working hours and lives are vastly different and more complex than they were just a few years ago, and public transport needs to adapt to that in a far better way. The provision of safe, well-lit and secure parking could be one very practical way that the federal government could help the states. Interestingly, in Sydney's sprawling western suburbs rail patronage has increasedâprobably in response to rising fuel prices and heavy road trafficâyet little has been done to reduce overcrowding, and as a result frustration levels will increase and levels of violence along with that frustration.</para><para>The government plans to spend $1.2 billion on roads over the next five years and to funnel the money directly to local government. I can only imagine the improvement to public transport if a similar amount of money were spent upgrading the passenger rail network and extending government bus fleet coverage. Governments everywhere must surely realise that, whilst public transport has its cost, it is a cost worth paying. As public confidence in public transport increases, so will patronage, and then the cost to the government should come down. The latest railway line to open in Sydney, the airport link, just went broke because it was too expensive for locals and airport travellers alike. Who would catch a train for $10 one way when for not a lot more you can catch a cab and be dropped off with your baggage outside the check-in?</para><para>As global fuel prices spiral ever upward, state and federal governments seem to have a collective policy vacuum. In Sydney, they had the magnificent Olympics where hundreds of thousands of people caught buses and trains on a daily basis, many of them for the first time. The system for the most part coped well, but now the party is over and commuters can probably expect a return to business as usual: expensive and overcrowded trains that run late and out of timetable order. That is a pity, because a tremendous opportunity has been lost to get thousands of cars off urban roads. The Democrats believe that if you make public transport cheap, safe and, more importantly, reliable, people will use it. Instead, we find that public transport is becoming more expensive. For many people, bus and train timetables appear to be either a closely guarded secret or simply out of print. Given that so many staff have been shed from the public transport sector in recent yearsâmachines sell tickets, stations operate for hours at a time with no staff and buses and trams no longer have conductorsâit is little wonder that simply getting a timetable can cause one to wonder if it isn't classified information. Commuters care little if 93 per cent of trains run on time or within two minutes of schedule. That sounds great on paper, but the reality is that two minutes could be the difference between catching a connecting train or bus and standing in the rain or heat for up to half an hour waiting for the next one.</para><para>The UK government have a Commission for Integrated Transport. This organisation is looking at road-tolling, amongst other measures, to try and tackle the projected doubling of motorway congestion in that country by the year 2010. A combination of tolls on motorways and congestion charges will probably be the only way to halt the clogging of their arterial roads. We seriously need to be looking to the future in that regard as well. Our nation is still in a position where we need not repeat the mistakes of other countries. Urban planning needs to be much better thought out. I find it hard to comprehend that new areas are being opened up for development without fixed public transport links. Whilst the Democrats welcome the extra funding for road improvements, it is high time we looked at establishing a similar Commission for Integrated Transport in order to truly address Australia's future transport needs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>20927</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI start my contribution to the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline> by saying that Mr John Anderson has had a good week in the media this week. This public relation success is one which has obviously been built on a very simple but nearly always successful formula: promise to spend buckets of money. But the success of this strategy is not sustainable because the policy underpinning it is not sustainable. This road funding promise is not part of a broader long-term plan to build land transport infrastructure in regional Australia, nor is it part of a properly considered overall transport plan for the nation. It does not fit in with any national strategy for rail because there is not one. It does not fit in with any long-term strategy for coastal and international shipping because there is not one. And it does not fit in with any long-term plan for air transport in this country, again because there is not one.  </para></talk.start><para>Mr Anderson has been attempting to get his transport package for the Sydney Basin, including airport arrangements, through cabinet for at least a year. There was an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on 27 March this year headed `Anderson hints at Badgerys option'. The story referred to the resumption of the cabinet debate on the second airport to take place the following day. So here we are, some nine months later, with the transport minister still trying to get his option up, with no success. Max Moore-Wilton, it appears, is now taking over the debate. He has simply bypassed the Deputy Prime Minister and is apparently dropping his own option on the cabinet table. As for the very fast train, it is being progressed very, very slowly indeed by Mr Anderson. I hope the train is a bit faster than the progress. I understand this matter will again be considered by cabinet before the end of the year, and Mr Anderson will recommend yet another study, this time into the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne option.</para><para>The reason the government has announced this policyâand the timing of the announcement is not even part of a long-term political strategy on the part of the governmentâand this spending is to try to stem the erosion of support for the Howard government in regional Australia resulting from high petrol prices. The government's dilemma was highlighted on 20 November in Melbourne by the principal of Australian National Opinion Polls, Mr Rod Cameron. Mr Cameron told a transport forum that the cost of petrol had become a major challenge for the Howard government. He told his audience that the issue of high petrol prices was really taking off. According to ANOP research undertaken in September last yearâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âThis is the Labor Party's pollster, is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>â26 per cent of regional motorists nominated petrol prices as an important issue. And, no, of course it has nothing to do with Labor Party polling; I suspect this polling was funded by the commercial sector. It would be interesting to see the reaction of the government's own polling, if they were ever to reveal it. It would be interesting to see whether they contested the ANOP finding in October this year, just over a month ago, that that numberâthat is, the 26 per cent of regional motorists nominating petrol prices as an important issueâhad jumped to 52 per cent. Mr Cameron said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Shifts of this magnitude are rarely seen in opinion surveys.</para></quote><para>He went on to say that petrol prices and taxes on fuel were a political hot buttonâand that would be an understatement. Mr Cameron, who has some considerable experience in the business of political polling, gave the Howard strategy of attempting to buy off motorists with a boost to road funding the thumbs down. He said that increased road funding was not the political saviour the government hoped it would be. Mr Cameron said that, while additional road funding was welcomeâand, in fact, it is desperately needed, given the lack of attention given to regional roads by this government since March 1996âit was given very much less priority by the community than the pain of higher petrol prices. </para><para>The attitude of the Prime Minister on the issue of fuel tax tells us two things: firstly, that he is a very stubborn man; and, secondly, that he is badly out of touch with what is affecting families generally. He is also very badly out of touch with what is affecting families living outside the major population centres. Mr Howard, of course, has dismissed calls for a freeze on the scheduled increase in excise on fuel in February. He says that a few cents off the price of petrol is neither here nor there. It is important to remember that last July, when the GST came in, the government cut fuel excise by 6.7c a litre but then effectively imposed a GST of 8.2c a litreâthat is, an extra tax take of 1.5c a litre. There are other factors behind rising petrol prices, like world oil prices and a falling Australian dollar, but Mr Howard can do something about these ever increasing fuel prices. He could keep his promise and reduce the excise by the full amount of the GST. </para><para>This is a compounding problem. Petrol excise increases automatically with inflation. The GST causes the inflation that causes the excise to go up, and since the GST is 10 per cent on top of the excise, the rising excise is causing the GST take to increase. So we have a vicious cycle of a tax on a tax, which I might say is something that Mr Howard promised would never happen under his government. According to the Australian Automobile Association, if the February excise increase goes throughâand the Prime Minister insists that it willâmotorists will be paying 4c in excise in the first year of the GST. That is an extra $1.36 billion in revenue flowing to the government. And remember, the road funding package is $1.6 billion over four years.</para><para>As I said, the view of the Prime Minister is that a cut of a couple of cents a litre on fuel is hardly worth the trouble. He ignores the fact that the average household budget is now groaning under the strain of the Howard government's measures. Brand new roads are nice, but they are of limited value if the household budget does not provide enough money to run the family car. Mr Howard is rapidly changing the role of the family car: it is becoming a luxury item.</para><para>I now turn to the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline>. Given that Senator Mackay talked about roads of national importance and we have called them RONIâsome people have called them roads of National Party importanceâI have been turning my mind to what we will call the expenditure under this program. It could be the RTR Program, or some people might ungenerously call it the `rorter' program just to spin that out, or it could be the road wreck program. No doubt someone in the government is trying to spin out a little propaganda that can be associated with Roads to Recovery. Someone suggested it was a roads to National Party recovery program, but I am sure that Senator Ian Macdonald would not wish that. I see that a number of three-cornered contests will come up in Queensland next year. I am sure he will not be campaigning for the National Party candidate, which I suppose they are quite happy about because I think we could look forward to winning any seat that Senator Ian Macdonald campaigned in. But I suppose the government will be smarter than that.

I want to know whether subclause 7(5) negates everything before it: that is, whether subclause 7(1) through to subclause 7(4) are overridden by subclause 7(5). I want to know why the minister also allowed an inaccurate explanatory memorandum to be circulated without correction: the wording in subclause 7(5) is in conflict with the explanatory memorandum. The minister has also allowed his office to issue deceptive media releases and information that inflate how much funding each federal electorate will receive. Mr Martin Ferguson has issued press releases on this matter which have not been disproved by anything the government has said, and one of which states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>The documents reveal that Brisbane Council gets $28.6 million over four years, but that money has been double counted in each of the Federal seats of Bowman, Brisbane, Dickson, Fadden, Griffith, Lilley, Moreton, Oxley, Petrie, Rankin and Ryan.</para><para>Other examples of `double counting' include:</para><para>In Melbourne, the City of Casey gets $3.5 million, but that is double counted in each of the seats of Aston, Bruce, Isaacs, La Trobe, Holt, and Flinders. </para><para>In Sydney, Parramatta Council gets $2.4 million, but that money is double counted in each of the seats of Bennelong, Parramatta and Reid. </para></quote><para>It would be very interesting to get an actual allocation or find a mechanism to see whether there is some discretion in whether some of those seats will get all of the money and some none, or whether any direction will be given to local governments so that the money will be split equally amongst those seats, or whether the government will live up to the press release rather than the announcement and amend the bill and provide more money. It would be interesting to get a response to that. The minister has provided misleading and improper information about how the money was allocated to particular states and territories and within those states and territories. Senator Mackay has more than adequately dealt with aspects of that problem. For example, Senator Ian Macdonald has already gone on the record as saying that the funding was allocated to the states based on a formula but that the government then simply made adjustments to those allocations. I would suggest that this was clearly done not in the interest of better roads but in the interests of political advantage.</para><para>The minister has placed a cloud over the integrity of this package by these actions. If it is a sound public policy, why has the minister felt the need to fiddle with the original formulas? Why has the minister felt the need to double count numbers to make the package look better? This package will not deliver what the government claims it will because it is not part of a national plan to upgrade the transport system in this country. And time is rapidly running out for many regional areas in this regard. Let us take East Gippsland as an example. It has been the focus of political attention in Victoria for some time. At the state election a great many issues existed in East Gippsland, but one of the issues was transport and roads. That shire has 4,000 kilometres of roadway. Most of the roads were built in the 1940s. Those roads were not designed to carry B-doubles, milk tankers or log trucks. This 60-year-old road system is having to accommodate vehicles that weigh twice as much and travel at least 30 per cent faster than was the case in 1940. This nation's regional road network needs a properly planned, properly funded, long-term strategy, not a package designed only to meet a short-term political problem. </para><para>As I said earlier, this package is unlikely to meet that problem. If Mr Cameron's polling is correct and the price of petrol is indeed a hot button issue for 52 per cent of people living in regional Australia, then it will be quickly forgotten. But I suppose we will see this government seek to manufacture whatever political advantage it can out of the package. That is not surprising. We will be watching just how the announcements are made. No doubt we can look to the form guide and see how this government has operated in the past. I will be surprised if this government is not exactly true to form. There will be no need for any inquiry on the spending of this because it will be consistent with the way the government has spent money in the past, with a weather eye on the political advantage rather than the interests of the nation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>20931</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is interesting that we are dealing today with a piece of legislation called the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline>. On other occasions when the federal government are about to pork-barrel or about to effect some scam, they have these Orwellian titles. If I had more time today, I would have gone through and identified the interesting names that legislation gets given by this federal government. Now we have this interesting name Roads to Recovery. As my party has said on a number of occasions, and our leader has said it: what is the point of having these roads upgraded if you have no money to pay for the petrol to use them? It is clear that the exorbitant price of fuel in this country has not been addressed by this government and will not be addressed by this government. </para></talk.start><para>This legislation allows for a measly $1.2 billion extra to be spent over the next four years. That is $400 million that will be allocated throughout the country. This year, and this year alone, the federal government collected $11 billion in fuel exciseâ$11 billion. No wonder they will not entertain any serious discussion on ending the exorbitant indexation figures and formula that they have. As we know, and if you look at the list of the 17 lucky recipients of the major areas of funding, you will see that the 17 high earners, I suppose you might call them, are in government held seats. One might call it a bonanzaâa National Party-Liberal Party bonanza. The man who gets the most money is the member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey, with a 16 per cent margin, is probably all right at the next election. The member for Maranoa, Mr Bruce Scott, with a 14.4 per cent margin, is probably all right. His electorate will get $51 million. However, then you start to hit pay dirt. </para><para>The member for Kalgoorlie has a margin of only 2.1 per cent. However, his electorate will receive $50 million. The electorate of Gwydir, held by the embattled Deputy Prime Minister, Mr AndersonâMr Anderson, one might assume, on a margin of 11.1 per cent, might be in no difficultyâwill receive $42 million. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, and I know, in the last few years the areas that have swung most against parties are not the metropolitan seats but the country seats. I would suggest that Mr Anderson is a very nervous man, and rightly so, because he is in deep trouble. He is in what Miss Jackie Kelly calls do-do. He is in deep do-do at the moment because of his constituency. They are fed up with him and they are fed up with the National Partybetraying them, as we have seen evidence of in the last few days. Going down the list, No. 5 is the member for Wannon. He is a Liberal and his electorate will get $37 million. Then we have the electorate of Parkes, held by a Liberal minister, which will get $36 million. The Liberal's margin in Parkes is 5.8 per cent.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>âThe Nationals.

The National Party held seat of Parkes has a 5.8 per cent margin. Whether or not the member will stay there next time, I do not know. But I would suggest that, once again, the swings will come from the country areas. That is where the bite will get you, and that is probably what will turf you out of power at the next election. The Liberal held seat of McEwen, which has a margin of one per cent, will get $36 million. And on it goes right down to Ballarat, a Liberal held seat, which will receive $25 million out of this bonanza. Its margin is 2.8 per cent. As has been rightly identified, this is pork-barrelling on a National Party scaleâa Bjelke-Petersen scale, one might suggest, and it has found its way into the coalition. They are trying to buy the next election, but I suggest that the country people are a wake-up to them. You and I know they are a wake-up to the coalition, because we know, as we move around our various states, how much on the nose the coalition is. I have a number of quotes that I might use at the end of my contribution to further highlight that. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to ask the minister a series of questionsâand they are serious questionsâin relation to the funding details. First of all, there is not a lot of information on the details. I have been asked questions by, as you knowâand I am sure you addressed itâthe Australian Local Government Association, which I have been actively participating in. A number of local government colleagues have asked me this series of questions, which I put to you tonight. The first question is: what conditions are there tied to this funding? Will it relate to the existing level of spending on roads? What I mean by that is: if a council area embarked upon a vigorous and extensive road construction program in previous years, may the council be penalised because it has essentially done that in terms of the council area? Will you be required to spend your funding in yearly tranches or can you spread out the work for your road construction program over four years? If you do not spend your annual funding in each year, will you be disentitled to further funding? If you are required to spend the annual funding each year, how will this impact on the long-term road priorities of a council? If we have a four-year window, what will be the impediments to the funding applications of councils? In other words, what might be the problems for councils in the long term?</para><para>Also, has the government considered the inevitable shortage of contractors and, therefore, the inevitable increase in price due to demand exceeding supply? I say to you: if this money is going to hit all at once and if councils are required to spend their money all at once, there are obviously not enough contractors in the country to do that work. You might say: `That is going to create employment.' I do not believe it will, because I recall many years ago, when I was an official in the TWU and we used to go out into country areas such as Wilcannia, Burke and Broken Hill, that the Fraser government in 1980-81âI cannot recall the legislationâchanged the legislation to make state authorities compete with private construction firms for road construction. A number of the state authorities were not able to compete competitively and, as such, not only did the state authorities lose the work but a lot of jobs disappeared in country towns, from the DMR and the country roads boards et cetera.</para><para>What I find most interesting in this legislationâand I am sure my colleagues have mentioned itâis that you must put up a sign to say that this road has been constructed by John Howard. I do not know whether the sign comes out of the $1.2 billion but I think it is interesting that Mr Howard and his party are continuing to remind people that they are being ripped off on their petrol prices, that they are not getting their value for dollar and that all they have is Mr Howard and his government with their hands in their pockets. If I were the government, I would not want to be identified with the measly amounts of dollars that they are allocating for road construction, in that there is more money there that should be dealt with. But, no, this government want to put up a sign to say it was funded by them when in fact a lot more money that they are collecting from motorists and from industry they are not passing back to motorists. They are continuing to index the level of excise increases so that in February next year more money will go into the Commonwealth government and less into road construction. </para><para>As I have said, you have these people with their hands in their pockets and they do not seem to be picking up the drift from the Australian community that it is not roads necessarily that they wantâit is petrol price reduction. I know that petrol prices at service stations in our area on Pennant Hills Road in Sydney can vary between service stations in one night by between 4c and 6c a litre. They tell me that on Pennant Hills Road sometimes petrol can be 10c less a litre on Monday morning than on a Sunday night. But what are the government doing about that? Nothing. They are going to index those increases again in February next year. This tax is one which people, as I said, are fed up with and they wish that the government would do something about it. In fact, on 22 November this year, Mr Lachlan McIntosh, who seems to be a bit more critical of you than you might have expected, said:</para><quote><para>The Commonwealth would have to spend $1.2 billion immediately plus $300 million per year just to catch up on the shortfall for the past four years and to maintain the current network properly.</para><para>Any road funding program also needs to be seen in light of the additional tax the Commonwealth is taking from motorists. If the Prime Minister insists on applying full indexation to petrol in February, Commonwealth excise will have risen by over four cents per litre this financial year alone.</para><para> The extra four cents in excise will give the government an additional $1.3 billion per year in revenue at a time when it is reportedly offering motorists $300 million per year for roads as compensation. I don't believe too many people will see that as fair or reasonable. </para></quote><para>Mr McIntosh said on 27 November:</para><quote><para>The Government needs to understand, however, that this package does not compensate motorists for the extra tax they have been forced to pay since the introduction of the GST.</para></quote><para>On 28 November the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> stated that Mr Ian Donges, who is the President of the National Farmers Federation: </para><quote><para>... told reporters in Canberra that the new roads package, while welcome, was "not going to change our views on petrol prices".</para><para>"That is a separate issue and we will continue to talk about it."</para></quote><para>So even people who might be regarded as coalition supporters or people who would generally support them are not taken in by this con. They know that this government is taking more and more money from people and using it just as a revenue raiser.

I thank Senator Greig, who spoke on behalf of the Democrats, for a thoughtful address on some of the difficulties and problems that confront transport issues throughout Australia. I do not take any issue with much of what Senator Greig said, but he referred to matters that are principally the responsibility of state governments. I will return to this in some detail later, but they are things for which the Commonwealth has little responsibility, and Senator Greig's comments, appropriate as they are in many instances, are comments that should be addressed to the state governments. If they were, I would support many of the things that he has said.</para></talk.start><para>This is the most massive investment ever in one lump sum in the road network of Australiaâand, importantly, in the local road network in Australia. It has been obvious to councils and all of those interested in local roads that there is a desperate need for additional funding. That funding has been needed for a decade or more now. It is a desperate need that was ignored completely by the previous government and it is a desperate need that local government has made us aware of. It has probably been the most often requested approach made to me since I have been a ministerâand to all of my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties. We have understood that a lot of local roads were built for the horse and buggy. The roads are now taking B-double and B-treble vehicles. Local authorities are simply unable to fund them. Regrettably, state governments of all political persuasions have not assisted local governments even though those responsibilities are priority responsibilities for state governments.  </para><para>In this absence, the federal government has produced this very significant investment in the local road network. We are able to do that because the Howard government took the hard decisions. It brought the economy back under control, it addressed the $10 billion black hole that Mr Beazley left in the federal budget when we took office in 1996, and it addressed the $80 billion government debt that Labor left us. We have that down now to very manageable proportions and it is continuing to fall. We are very hopeful that, in the very near future, we will be able to pay off all government debt. That will mean that money used for interest rates that, under Labor, people paid overseas or paid elsewhere to financiers will now be able to be diverted into things that are appropriate and needed by the Australian people. It is a massive investment, one that has been particularly well received. </para><para>Anyone who has been down to the Australian Local Government Association conference this weekâand I take it from the comments made by the Labor speakers that they have not been anywhere near itâwill see the smiles on the faces. I have never been to a happier gathering of local government. Local government understand just what a fabulous package this is. They cannot help their mirth when Mr Beazley and Mr Ferguson call this a boondoogling or boondogglingâwhatever it means and however you pronounce it; no Australian understands Mr Beazley's language. When you look it up in the dictionary, it means trifling and unnecessary. That is what Mr Beazley thought about it. Notwithstanding that, he is now supporting it. I take it from what Senator Hutchins said that he is not supporting it. It will be interesting to see how Senator Hutchins votes; it seems from his speech that he is totally opposed to it because he reckons it is pork-barrelling. We will watch with interest which side of the chamber you move to, Senator Hutchins. </para><para>Local governments smile, almost with a resigned sorrow, when Mr Beazley and Mr Ferguson criticise this. Local governments understand that the way the package is presented distributes the money exactly as local governments currently get their FAGs. Local governments currently get their FAGs under an act of 1994-95 which the Labor Party introduced. It is that formula that is currently being used to distribute these funds. The formula is this, and I have explained this time and time again to Senator Mackay. In estimates, we went through 32 pages of questions and answers. I think Senator Mackay said in her speech that I refused to answer anything. I do not know what we did for the 32 pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> where I tried desperatelyâI even used one-syllable wordsâto explain to Senator Mackay how this worked. If she had any understanding of local government, she would know, without me having to explain it to her, but she quite clearly does not. Senator Hutchins, you do not understand how local government works, so I will explain to you what this formula is that your party introduced in 1994. We agreed with it; we supported it in those days.</para><para>The formula is this. There are certain general principles set. Then the state grants commissions work out a formula. They are commissions that are set up by the various state governments. Regrettably, most of them are Labor governments at the present time, so they are set up by Labor governments. Those state grants commissions work out a formula on how they will distribute the money to all the councils in their states. They then distribute the general FAGs moneyâthat is, the FAGs money under the financial assistance grants actâto councils along the formulas which they strike, which they adopt, which we approve as being fair and reasonable. That is how the money is distributed. </para><para>Senator Hutchins, you saidâand I think Senator Mackay did; I did not listen to a lot of what she had to sayâthat this was all pork-barrelling. If it is pork-barrelling, perhaps you had better see Mr Beattie, who appoints the Queensland Grants Commission and agrees with me on the formula that is used. Perhaps you had better see Mr Bracks. In your own state, why don't you see Mr Carr if you think that it is unfortunate? It is a great pork-barrelling exercise, so Senator Hutchins and others have said. Then Senator Hutchins nominated the seats that get the money. O'Connor! Even Senator Hutchins could not resist saying that that is a seat we hold by 16 per cent. It is a real pork-barrelling exercise; it is really going to the marginal seats where we need votes! I think the next seat he mentioned was Maranoa, which again I think he acknowledged was perhaps one of the safest coalition seats going. Then he talked about Wannon, where my good friend David Hawker holds one of the safest seats in the country. Apparently, this is how we pork-barrel: we give all the money to the safest seats in the land. Come on, Senator Hutchins: not even you can believe that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âSenator Mackay can believe that because she will believe anything.

It has been boondoggling to Mr Anderson in Gwydir.' If you think that is wrong, you pick up the phone and ring Mr Carr and tell him his state's Grants Commission are embarked upon a boondoggling exercise to help Mr Anderson. I am sure Mr Carr will give you a very receptive hearing! I think it more likely though, Senator, that Mr Carr will say to you, `Don't be stupid. Don't take any notice of your so-called spokesman on these. Have a look at the act and understand that the act is perfectly fair and reasonable.' That is why councils across Australia, every council I have spoken to at the Australian Local Government Association conferenceâand I think I have spoken to just about every one of themâare absolutely ecstatic about this investment and the way it is delivered. They know, even though you do not, Senator. As I say, I can appreciate you don't understand how these things work, Senator. They understand, and that is why they smileâand they are very polite peopleâwhen Mr Beazley says that it is a pork-barrelling exercise. They know that it is a very fair system, it is an independent system, it is a system that is done by the States Grants Commission, and they just shake their head sadly when Mr Beazley demonstrates that he has no idea and that his advisers, his spokesmen in local government and transport matters, simply do not understand or, if they do, they have been unable to explain to Mr Beazley how it all works.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to return to some of the things that Senator Mackay said, because we can have some fun with that prior to Christmas, and it seems that this is the sort of spirit in which we should take some of Senator Mackay's comments.

It is difficult for the Commonwealth to have a strategy, because it is something that the states have to do. But we have addressed this. We have addressed this by calling together the Australian Transport Councilâthe ministerial councilâwho are setting up a secretariat, and we are working with the states to get an overall transport strategy. Senator Greig, you are the Democrat spokesman. You are relatively new at that, but you will understand from your research that the Australian Transport Council does work together. It is a state-federal thing. It works together on a strategy towards a national transport infrastructure approach. It is something this government very much supports. I know the Democrats would support that. You do not need to go into these sorts of amendments. That sort of approach is already being taken and, whilst it is mainly a states issue, the Commonwealth has brought the states together jointly with the Commonwealth to get that national approach. </para></talk.start></continue><para>About the GST indexation: I cannot imagine why the Labor Party would have the hide to raise this. Let me tell you about the indexationâand, Senator Greig, you can work out how genuine the Labor Party is being in raising this matter. When Labor came to office in 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c per litre. When Labor left office, excise was 34.183c per litre, an increase of 28c per litre, or over 550 per cent during Labor's term of government.

You are talking about doing away with the indexation. Which political party introduced indexation? Labor introduced indexation in August 1983. Just a few months after they got into government, they introduced the indexation of the excise. As the indexation is linked to the CPI, petrol excise increased far more under Labor, with its average 5.2 per cent inflation between 1983 and 1986, than it has under the coalition, where inflation has been on average 1.4 per cent. So not only did you introduce the indexation, but you made it worse by the galloping inflation which your government presided over. Because of that, the price of petrol went up. I assume from what everyone has said that it is Labor policy to get rid of the indexation. Is that right, Senator Mackay: Labor is going to get rid of indexation permanently?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âYou can read the resolution.

If they get rid of indexation on excise, I guess they are also going to get rid of indexation on financial assistance grants for local government, and I guess you are also going to get rid of indexation on the pensions, because every six months pensions are indexed in connection with the CPI as well. So Labor are promising, as I understand from Senator Mackay, to do away with indexation of fuel. That is going to be interesting; we will keep them to that. We will see how this works when the election promises to get rid of indexation come out. We will then wonder how they are going to index pensions and FAGs, just to name two. That should be a fascinating financial and accounting exercise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Greig, if you happen to believe just in passing that Labor are serious about the indexation issue, just think of Labor's recordânot what they say but what they have done. They introduced indexation on excise and now they have the hide to raise it as an issue. It is getting so close to Christmas and we are having such a good time. Regrettably, time is going to defeat me in this, but I want to mention a couple of things that Senator Mackay raised. Firstly, she said money is being pushed out in one mode only. Well, I do not know what the Alice Springs to Darwin railway is then! It is a massive investment by this government, the Northern Territory government and the South Australian government in railway infrastructure. The government has also completely abolished the excise on fuel for railways.</para><para>Senator Mackay, I have used one-syllable words when I have tried to explain to you this formula that is in use. Have a look at the annual report of local government. It demonstrates in every state how these state grants commissions distribute those roads grants. It will show you that this is a completely fair and independent approach to distribution, one which local government as a whole unanimously endorses. I have mentioned pork-barrelling. Senator Mackay said that Northern Territory got a cut of two per cent. The Northern Territory is going to get $20 million more than it has ever had for local roads. According to Senator Mackay, that is a cut of two per cent. It will get $20 million more than it has ever had for local roads, and I am told by the Labor Party that that is a cut. There is no great secret about the way we have done this. It has all been explained. </para><para>I am very proud to be a part of a government that has initiated this huge investment in Australia's roadsâ$1.6 billion across the board; $1.2 billion of it going fairly and evenly to all local authorities across Australia. It does go direct to councils, and that is why we are dealing with this bill as an appropriation bill. We have great confidence in local authorities' ability to use the money fairly and expeditiously. They will get the best value out of it, so we are delighted to be able to do that. Local government are delighted to take on the challenge given to them. I know that, as a result of the work local government will do with the money the Howard government has provided, the people of Australia will get a better system of roads. I am delighted about that. I regret that the Labor Party in their 13 years in office did nothing about this except to run up debts of $80 billion, leaving the budget in a $10 billion deficit when we took over. They did nothing for the roads system. The government is fixing that at long last. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mackay's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

We have substantially liberalised air travel between Australia and the rest of the world. Since March 1996 we have increased the available capacity for passenger services by more than 510 Boeing 747s per week. We have negotiated Australia's first open skies agreement, which is with New Zealand. The agreement will allow Australian and New Zealand international airlines to operate across the Tasman and beyond to third countries without restriction. It is the agreement that the Labor Party was not able to sign. We all remember the midnight fax from the member for Kingsford-Smith, Mr Brereton, the then Minister for Transport, to the New Zealand transport minister which caused a crisis in Australia-New Zealand relations. </para><para>The government has transformed the domestic airline industry with the emergence of Virgin Blue and Impulse as trunk route operators. The increased competition is creating jobs and helping to boost our tourism industry. Air travel is now a realistic option for people who could never afford it before. The statistics for Septemberâthe first month that all four airlines were operatingâshow that, compared to September 1999, they carried an additional 240,000 passengers along the east coast. That is an increase of over 25 per cent. The average load factor along the east coast corridor was 83 per cent. </para><para>We have successfully implemented the world's most advanced air traffic control system. Last year, Airservices Australia was recognised as the best provider of air traffic services in the world. When the government took office in 1996 there were serious problems with the board of CASA and its senior management. It is worth remembering that, under the Labor Party, aviation safety regulation was in a state of complete turmoil. CASA's predecessor, the Civil Aviation Authority, was in a state of continual reorganisation. In less than seven years there were four chairmen, four chief executives and six heads of safety regulation. There were also eight ministerial changes in the portfolio. We are calmly and decisively improving air safety regulation through our measured approach to aviation safety reform. CASA has now adopted the quality management approach that is standard in the world's best safety focused organisations. The authority has established a regulatory service division to streamline the way it issues critical safety approvals to the industry. A full-scale regulatory reform program has been developed, and it is with the government for final approval. I recognise that the government's approach is not as fast as some people in the industry might like, but it is the only way to get results. There is still important work to do, and the government is in constant contact with CASA as progress is made. </para><para>In speaking on this report, there are a couple of final points I would like to make on aviation. For political gain, the Labor Party has continually been beating up on the minor issues without considering the effects that its action will have on the ability of the regulatory authority, CASA, to regulate air safety. For over a decade air safety regulation in this country has been corroded by bitterness and personal abuse. Since 1998 the air safety regulator has had seven chairmen and seven chief executives. Ministers have generally appointed good people to these positions, but the chairmen and chief executives have never been given a chance. They are immediately attacked from all sides for the most trivial reasons. They leave in despair and the cycle starts again. Many people have asked why CASA has not been better managed. The answer is that the managers have never been given a chance to manage it effectively. But, as far as this government is concerned, it stops here. We are not allowing the opposition or anyone else to destroy the progress we have made in fixing air safety regulation. The Department of Transport and Regional Services report on the movement cap for Sydney airport is an important report. It shows that there are improvements that can be made but that Sydney airport has moved a long way to be an effective hub for regional New South Wales. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>20938</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the same matterâthe Department of Transport and Regional Services report on the movement cap for Sydney airport. It is interesting to hear Senator Sandy Macdonald laud his party about making a decision that he reckons the previous Labor government could not make. We are nearly into the fifth yearâI know this is difficult for Australians to handle; when you talk to them they are quite bitter about itâof a Howard government. If you look at today's newspapers, you see that the Howard government is considering constructing an airport at Kurnell, the birthplace of our nation. I only skimmed the paper, but from what I read the government are going to remove the Caltex oil refinery, which provides hundreds and hundreds of jobs to the Sutherland Shire. I do not know what they are going to do with the historic sites out there where Captain Cook landed and where the natives contested. If you go there you can see the actual spot where a distant relative of Cook's stepped ashore. Now there is this harebrained idea of constructing an airport at our nation's birthplace. But, with this government, you would not know whether it is actually making a decision about this or whether it is trying to create another furphy. </para></talk.start><para>In the 1996 Lindsay by-election we had undertakings from the federal government that they would not proceed with the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek. In 1996 the people in the west of Sydney were waiting for a decision from the cabinet. In 1997 we were assured by our lacklustre local member, Miss Jackie Kelly, that she would make sure that this did not go ahead. In the 1998 federal election, once again Miss Kelly said that this would not proceed. In 1999 we were told that there had been a division within cabinet about whether or not to proceed with the construction at Badgerys Creek. Now, in the year 2000, the people in the west are waiting for the coalition to come good with their promise and not go ahead with the construction at Badgerys Creek.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, coming from Queensland, you might not be aware, and your successor in the chair, being a Western Australian, might not be aware, that some of the harebrained schemes Miss Kelly has come up with over the years are very interesting. At one stage, Miss Kelly's idea of how to solve the increasing problem of air traffic congestion at Sydney airport was to construct some sort of floating airport off Botany Bay. I do not know how much that would cost, probably billions and billions of dollars, but, of course, this might save one coalition seat in the western suburbsâapparently one of the Prime Minister's pets. Let us look at this. We were going to have an airport constructed somewhere outside Botany BayâI might add, that is a major sea laneâwhere the planes would land and take off on this floating platform. I do not know how the people were going to get thereâprobably by ferry to Sydney Harbour where they would disembark. That was one of the ideas run by Miss KellyâI think it was before the last federal election. For all I know, Miss Kelly might have had an idea to register some of her staff out there at the floating airport before the last federal election. I am sure that she has been asked to answer those questions.</para><para>We have a situation now with Sydney airport where there has been an idea floated that we are going to have an airport at Kurnell. This should be very seriously considered by the federal government, because, as I said, there are hundreds of jobs at stake at the Caltex oil refinery, and it is the birthplace of our nation. All I can suggest is what we knew in New South Wales when the member for Cook was the transport minister: maybe the federal government is fed up with the member for Cook and has handed a gift to the Labor Party to make sure that we win Cook as we won it in 1972 and in 1974.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>20939</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I represent Mr Anderson here, I will not be commenting on speculation that was in the newspaper today, but I did want to follow on from Senator Hutchins's argument.

Of course, the people of that electorate showed very clearly what they thought of the ALP and of Mr Ross Free and, at the same time, what they thought of their newly elected and subsequently elected member, Jackie Kellyâa person who has made a fantastic contribution to this parliament and to this government and who I know does a great job for the people in her electorate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In discussing this important report on the movement cap for the Sydney airport, I want briefly to support the matters my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald raised concerning the administration of air safety within Australia. I have to agree with Senator Sandy Macdonald that, for the first time in a long time, the administration of air safety in Australia is in good hands. The current transport minister, Mr Anderson, has done a tremendous job as Minister for Transport and Regional Services in attending to a very difficult area. Under the previous government, the heads of CASAâthe Civil Aviation Safety Authorityâkept changing. Labor could not keep anyone in the position of Director of Air Safety Investigation. The end result was that the whole CASA organisation was in a state of permanent and constant turmoilâthere was never anyone to look after it. Since Mr Anderson has taken over, since this government has come to power, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has direction, it has a leader and it is doing a very good job in circumstances which are made much more difficult by the continual whingeing and carping that goes on from members of the opposition. I can only say, in speaking to this report on the movement cap for Sydney airport, that Mr Anderson has done a mighty job and has got the Civil Aviation Safety Authority moving now in the correct direction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>20940</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will also address this report, which was rarely mentioned by the previous speaker, Senator Ian Macdonald, who seemed to use the opportunity that the debate on this report provided to congratulate Minister Andersonâwho is, I think, his senior portfolio ministerâand to curry as much favour with Mr Anderson within government as he possibly can. Senator Macdonald does take every available opportunity to crawl to his superiors in the cabinet whenever possible, and I congratulate Senator Macdonald on taking yet another chance to ingratiate himself with the more senior members of the government, albeit a portfolio minister who represents the National Party, as we know. Up in Queensland, of course, Senator Macdonald exhibits a very different behaviour, as Senator Ludwig would know, where he is highly critical of the National Party. But once he comes down to Canberra, away from the rank and file of the Liberal Party out there in Queensland, it is a very different Senator Macdonald, one who is willing to ingratiate himself with Mr Anderson.</para></talk.start><para>What he did not mention to the Senate tonight was the fact that, as I read the report on the movement cap for Sydney airport, there were five occasions in July 2000, six occasions in August 2000 and a further five occasions in September 2000 when the movement cap of 80 at the airport was exceeded. That was not mentioned by Senator Macdonald. What Senator Macdonald did was take the opportunity to say to the Senate that no member of the opposition could criticise the Liberal Party, because nothing happened at Sydney airport in the 13 years that Labor was in government. </para><para>Unlike the current government that Senator Macdonald seems to forget has been in office for some five years when nothing has occurred, the previous Labor administration was criticised roundly for building an extra runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Even Senator Macdonald, you would think, would remember the public debate that occurred in this chamber, in this parliament, in the communityâparticularly in the city of Sydneyâabout the very initiative that the Hawke government took at that time. So you cannot take at face value what Senator Macdonald tells the Senate on these sorts of issues. You cannot believe what he says, because I can assure you there was a massive debate and a community consultation process, as all would be aware, about the question of the building of a third runway at Kingsford Smith.</para><para>Towards the end of the period of the Keating government, the then Labor administration was well advanced in terms of a very thorough environmental impact process in relation to the proposed new airport at Badgerys Creek. That was well under way, and I might say that credit goes to the then environment minister, Senator Faulkner, and the then transport minister, Mr Brereton, for the work they had done in trying to ensure there was a thorough environmental impact process at that particular time. Five years later, with this government in office, the issue has not advanced at all and now there is speculation about an airport at Kurnell. Frankly, I am sure the next thing Mr Howard will do is revisit Miss Jackie Kelly's idea of having a floating airport off the coast of Sydney.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWhat's wrong with it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âThe only thing wrong with it is that the only other person who ever proposed it was ex-Democrat Senator John Coulter.

When I was State Vice-President of the Young Liberal Movement in the late sixties, the hot issue of the day was: will we build Badgerys Creek airport? This has moved on and on and it has moved from spot to spot. We all remember that Galston was the favourite spot at one point when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister of Australia, only that he discovered that the aircraft were going to fly over the marginal seat of Parramatta, so that idea stopped. Other sites that have been suggested include Somersby, down in the south. There has been the suggestion that Wilton should get the airport. Holsworthy has been another suggestion. As Senator Faulkner said, the idea has been floated of putting it offshore and, of course, the Towra Point proposal that has again come to light today I can first recall came to light 30 years ago. So this has been moving around and around for a very long period of time.</para></talk.start><para>If we have a look at what actually happened over that 30 years, what we have had is increased expansion of Sydney airport and the massive building program that has gone on there. The building of a third runway, which was rather painfully started by the last Labor government against the opposition of many of its members, has meant we have had the consolidation of Sydney airport. This airport is, of course, going to reach some point where it can no longer expand; it will have reached its capacity. That period of time seems to keep stretching out and it could be another 10 years.</para><para>If you do a study of airports overseas, you will find that many can actually take a greater capacity than Sydney airport already does. With new plane technologies, there is quite a possibility that in future you will have much larger planes flying, so you will need fewer take-offs for the passenger numbers. Also the new technologies of quieter jets can start to solve the problem of noise over airports. But it will come to a day when we need to build another airport in Sydney and the sixty-four thousand dollar question now, as it has been for the last 30 or 40 years, is: where are we going to put that airport? </para><para>You will find that in London they built a second airport at Gatwick and that succeeded. If you go to a place like Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, you will find that, after they built a second airport about 1Â½ hours away from the city, nobody wanted to fly there and they eventually had to shut it down. There are a lot of costs and a lot of infrastructure related to an airport, and the decision has to be made very carefully. It has been an incredibly difficult thing to decide over the years because of the conflicting needs of different parts of the city and the different benefits and losses of such a decision. It has been made extremely difficult over time. </para><para>If we have a look at this proposal that managed to leak out of a cabinet discussion today, and now the Labor Party are running around like hares as if this was reality, it is just a discussion. Cabinet really should be able to discuss all sorts of options. I mentioned all the options have been on the table over many years. They should be able to discuss those options, and it is a great pity that such matters leak and then Labor members do their best to put those things in a dim light, obviously trying to distract from their own terrible problems of electoral rorting that are going on at the moment. We must finally make a sensible decision. To make that decision, the government must consider all options; all options must be put on the table. I think there are still some places where we could put a second airport away from a population area, but, as I indicated with the example of Vancouver, you have got to get this fine balance. It cannot be so close to the city that it annoys huge numbers of people but, on the other hand, it cannot be too far away from the city, because people will not be bothered travelling to it and, like Vancouver, it will close down. It is a vexed decision. It is one that needs almost the wisdom of Solomon. We have had governments of all colours and persuasions come and go and not come to a final decision on this issue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>20942</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on this report on a movement cap for Sydney airport. First, I want to take up some of the points made by Senator Tierney. If you listened to Senator Tierney's five minutes, you would have thought that this was an issue that was just starting out, that somehow all options for Sydney airport are now back on the table. Senator Tierney actually said that all of these options, such as Somersby, Wilton, Holsworthy, Kurnell and Towra Point, should be back on the table. The real history of this issue is that it has been a vexed issue for quite a number of years, going back even further than 30 years. But the fact of the matter is that when the Labor government was in power it took the decision, following the environmental studies that were carried out on the various sites, to build a new airport at Badgerys Creek. As Senator Faulkner pointed out, we initiated the environmental impact statement into that, but we lost the election in 1996. </para></talk.start><para>What happened after 1996? Even though members of the opposition at that time, now members of the government, such as Senator Warwick Parer, who chaired a select committee into airport noise at Sydney airport, were then saying, `We've got to have an airport at Badgerys Creek,' telling the ALP to get on with it, this government and this Prime Minister announced that they were going to look at two sites, Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy. The Prime Minister is on the record as saying, `Sydney will get a second airport because we will have a choice between Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy.' When they realised that Holsworthy might actually end the career of Danna Vale in the seat of Hughes, they suddenly dropped Holsworthy and said they were going to proceed with Badgerys Creek. But now they are worried about the seats of Jackie Kelly and Ross Cameron, so they do not want to go ahead with Badgerys Creek. So they have raised this old proposal, going back many years, about an airport at Kurnell. It is obvious that the Prime Minister is not prepared to put Bruce Baird on trial in front of the committee looking at electoral matters but he is going to put him on trial in front of the people at the next election, because he will lose the seat of Cook if you go ahead with this crazy proposal. It is a crazy proposal because where they want to site an airport at Kurnell is directly in the flight path of the planes that have to land on the parallel runways at Mascot. That is the craziest proposal I have ever heard. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>20943</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>âOrder!

Before I do that, I want mention two aspects of this bill which are interesting: the first is that it is the biggest injection of funds into regional roads in Australia's history, and the second is that it is the biggest wrong call of an opposition that I have seen in my time here. Mr Beazley gratuitously insulted regional Australia, and in fact all of Australia, by calling this program boondoggling. I do not think there is anybody in regional Australia, certainly not the Local Government Association, which has been meeting in the last couple of days here, who would think that his comments were appropriate or right. A massive commitment to local roadworks in Australia is required, and it is obvious to everybody who lives in regional Australia that it is needed. For any of us who travel in regional Australia, the common complaint is that the roads are not good enough and should be improved. In fact, we are a big nation, geographically enormous, and many of our roadsâwhether they are old roads in need of repair, roads with narrow bridges on the North Coast or roads servicing isolated communitiesâneed this money spent on them. People there do not like the opposition leader of this country, for better or for worse, whatever you think of the opposition leader and the Labor Party, reflecting on their need by calling it boondoggling.</para></talk.start><para>The government are in a position to make this commitment to regional roads because of our good economic management. We have competency in the way that we run the economy, and that is important. But competency in the way that you run the economy is not good enough. This government also have a commitment to good public policy, and making it possible for regional communities to communicate by good roads is one of those. We have had nearly 40 quarters of growth in the economy. We have repaid a substantial proportion of Labor's $80 billion public debt. We are now in a position to make some dividend paymentsâwhich we have already done in terms of the social bonus from Telstra and in other ways with the Natural Heritage Trustâto put some of that money back into regional Australia.</para><para>Before I give some of the details, I would like to pick up on the comments of Senator Hutchins in his rather entertaining speech during the debate. He talked about the effect that the government's performance will have on the coalition at the next election. I think, Senator Hutchins, that we might just wait and see the result of the next election. We as a coalition will certainly not be resting on our laurels, I can assure the Labor Party of that. The Labor Party, whatever they call themselvesâCountry Labor; perhaps they think they have given themselves a blood transfusion with this new nameâare still pretty irrelevant in regional Australia. They are certainly irrelevant in New South Wales. At the last election, a most difficult one for the government, particularly a reforming government that came in with great expectations in regional Australia, the Labor Party received 23 per cent of the primary vote in Riverina. They received 30 per cent in New England against a new sitting member, Stuart St Clair, who won the seat brilliantly. Even in John Anderson's seat, a very difficult seat for himâdifficult with One Nation and difficult because of the issues for him being the primary industries minister during much of the time of the first Howard-Fischer governmentâLabor received 35 per cent of the primary vote. The Labor Party are a long way from home in regional New South Wales, whatever they might think and however they might convince themselves otherwise. We shall see at the next election. </para><para>I would also like to say, picking up on what some of the previous speakers said in the debateâand I did not have an opportunity to contributeâthat there is no whiteboard here. There is no funding for coalition seats. As Senator Ian Macdonald said, the reason why most of the money is going to regional Australia and regional seats is that the coalition holds the great majority of those seats. The majority of regional seats are held by the coalition. Regional seats are obviously geographically large and it is not surprising that they need a large share of the money. As I said, the money is allocated on a pro rata basis along the lines and form set up by the previous government. The major emphasis of the <inline ref="R1194">Roads to Recovery Bill 2000</inline> is on investment in the repair and maintenance of vital local roads. Every dollar of this funding will be over and above existing budget allocations from the federal government for local roadsâthe program for roads of national importance and the national highways program. It represents a 75 per cent increase in the current federal government's grants for local roads, which is $406 million in 2000-01. Of the $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion will be distributed directly to local government under the program for local road construction and repair on a pro rata basis. Around $850 million of the $1.2 billion for the program will be spent on rural and regional Australia in recognition of the fact that this is where the need is greatest.</para><para>New South Wales will receive a generous share of $340 million. New South Wales federal electorates are to receive significant funding and include the seats of Calare, around $14.8 million; Paterson, $8.8 million; Cowper, $12.7 million; Farrer, $29.8 million; Gwydir, $42.3 million; Hume, $16.8 million; Hunter, $12.3 million; New England, $29.2 million; Page, $15.6 million; Parkes, $36.7 million; and Riverina, $45.4 million. A further $400 million over four years from 2001-02 will be allocated to the national highway and roads of national importance projects to develop key arterial roads in outer metropolitan areas, with details to be unveiled next year once potential projects have been assessed and prioritised. This major investment in our roads is possible, as I said, because of the government's good economic management. It is unprecedented road funding, and it is desperately needed.</para><para>The allocation of funding to local councils within each state will be strictly in accordance with a formula adopted by the States Grants Commission, established and applied under the previous Labor government. The Labor Party stands with no ground in suggesting this necessary investment is pork-barrelling. The government, unlike the Labor Party, do not perceive the $1.2 billion investment in local roads to be trivial and unnecessary, and it will be applied in a way that meets the expectations of those people who live in regional Australia. The funding package is a legitimate attempt by the Howard-Anderson government to improve and upgrade the national and local roads network. The very fact that funding goes directly to local government to allow councils to spend the money according to their priorities reflects this approach. I know that the Local Government Association, which met in Canberra this week, are very pleased with the package.</para><para>I want to make a comment about the seat of Paterson, held by the Labor member Bob Horne, who is a big criticâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>âNot for long.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âAs you say, Senator Tierney, he will not be the member for long. He is a big critic of the program. The seat of Paterson has been a big beneficiary of the road funding under this Howard-Anderson government. As mentioned previously, Paterson will receive another $8.8 million under this program, as well as the improvements to the 11.8 kilometre stretch of the Pacific Highway between Coolongolook and Wang Wauk, south of Taree, announced in the 2000-01 budget. Earlier this year, the National Party leader, John Anderson, announced $690,000 in black spot funding for the Bucketts Way road. I think that is probably a record for black spot funding anywhere. That comprises $240,000 for the intersection with Merewether Lane at Gloucester and $450,000 for the intersection with Ribbons Road at Stroud. That is a very large amount of money in terms of black spot funding, which generally is allocated as small amounts of money. That is a very big commitment. This is in addition to two black spot funding announcements in 1999-2000 for the Great Lakes Shire: $85,000 on the Tea Gardens Road and $450,000 for Lakes Way at Booti Booti. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Saibai Island Council: Voters Roll</title><page.no>20945</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>20945</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening to raise an issue of concern on behalf of the people of Saibai Island in the Torres Strait. The islanders have had concerns about their local council election, which was carried out on 30 March 2000. The concerns they have relate to the process of assembling the roll for that election. I would like to quote from the Community Services (Torres Strait) Regulations 1998 and, in particular, `Part 3âVoters Roll'. It states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Returning officer must compile voters roll</para><para>275. The returning officer for <inline font-style="italic">an election for an Island council</inline> must compile the roll of persons entitled to vote at the election (the <inline font-weight="bold">"voters roll"</inline>). </para></quote><para>Section 275(2) of the same regulations states:</para><quote><para>However, in compiling the voters roll for an election for Saibai Island council, the returning officer for the election mustâ</para><para>(a) compile the voters roll based on the clans, to the extent necessary for the election; and </para><para>(b) if, under Island custom on Saibai Island, a person is not a member of a clanâconsult with the elders of the clans about the way in which the person's name should appear on the voters roll. </para></quote><para>On 2 April, several days after the conduct of that election, two of the islanders wrote to the Hon. Judy Spence, the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy. In that letter, they asked certain questions. The letter reads:</para><para>Â·	a number of Saibai Islanders (approximately 11) were placed in the wrong clans, specifically not placed in the Ait Koedal clan where the incumbent Chairman won the election by only five votes. </para><para>Â·	the electoral roll was not made available to three of the four candidates until 22 March, 2000 (the fourth candidate, the incumbent Chairman had the roll before anyone else)</para><para>Â·	the lateness of the roll meant that postal votes were unable to vote in time </para><para>Â·	no way of insuring postal votes were delivered ... </para><para>I have a copy of a circular that was sent out to the elders of Saibai Island on which 17 of the elders have completed the questionnaire as to whether they were consulted in relation to the placing of names on that roll. All 17 elders have confirmed that they were not consulted in relation to how those people would have been put on the roll. Also, going back as early as 16 August 1999, the people on Saibai have been requesting of their local council audited books relating to the council. I would like to quote from a letter from a Mr Colin Maka and a Mr Ron Enosa, directed to the Saibai Island Council. It reads:</para><quote><para>Attn council clerk Terry O'Neil </para></quote><quote><para>Dear Terry,</para><para>would you please make available to me a full set of audited financial documents pertaining to the running of the Saibai Island Council. I would appreciate the documents being available on or before 27/8/1999. Please contact me if there is any problem.</para></quote><para>Having had a meeting recently with both Mr Maka and Mr Enosa, they conveyed to me that they still have not received any copies of audited accounts for their local council to date. They are also concerned that there are now discussions on the island relating to the restructuring of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Their concerns are based on the past history of the council, the inability of the local people to access audited accounts and also the conduct of the council elections that I have spoken about. They also have concerns that there are moves to relocate the restructured Torres Strait Regional Authority to Brisbane. They believe that it would be totally inappropriate to have the authority, whose purpose is to administer their island, located in Brisbane. The islanders do want a new system, a new structure relating to their local government, but at this point in time they are not being consulted. I would like to quote again from the letter written to the Hon. Judy Spence on 2 April, just shortly after the election that I have referred to. The letter reads: </para><quote><para>On the 15 March Mr Colin Maka finally after waiting since January approached Mr O'Neil and requested a copy of the voters roll and was told that it was not yet finalised, Mr Maka was not happy with this and left the office. He returned to the Council office again on Friday 17 and requested again a copy of the roll, he was told by Mr O'Neil that it was still not ready and he (Mr Maka) should "keep on my back about the roll to make me do it". </para><para>Mr Maka left and returned on 20 March and was told by Mr O'Neil that the voters roll was not confirmed and would be available later on this week. Mr Maka left again and returned on the 22 March, only three days prior to the election and picked up the roll. After looking at the roll, Mr Maka and Mr Ron Enosa saw that the roll was dated and signed by the Mura Buay Council on the 17th March at a meeting which the incumbent Chairman Mr Terry Waia, Mr Terry O'Neil and the Mura Buay Council attended. We do not think that it is appropriate that a candidate, Mr Waia should not have been present as none of the other candidates had this advantage of early access to the final clan based roll, and the roll was dated and ready on the 17th but not given to anyone until the 22nd, why?</para><para>Mura Buay chairman Mr Solomon Aniba (not an elder) was presented with the voters roll and we were told to sign it, in doing so attesting to the fact that it was correct. Mr Aniba is a well respected member of our community but is in no position to determine the correctness of clan affiliationâonly the elders can do this and they were never consulted. None of the elders gave Mr Aniba consent to confirm the clan roll. </para></quote><para>The people of Saibai raise two issues: one, their dissatisfaction with the correlation and production of the roll for the council election; and, two, their dissatisfaction with not being able to attain audited statements of the council's financial position. They have grave concerns that this will be all covered up through a restructuring and that their restructured body will then be relocated in Brisbane, which would be totally inappropriate. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>âOrder!

The cessation in scrutiny, I can tell Senator Sandy Macdonald, is not going to happen. Why? Because the director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is under investigation for what appears to be a second breach of his own organisation's regulations. Why would any responsible member of parliament accede to a request by a government that we cease to scrutinise the important agencies that manage aviation safety? That is just an unreal proposition.

That it will prove to be a political scandal exposed for political advantage, with no permanent policy improvement resulting from it.</para><para>It is understandable that daily reporters, whether TV radio or press, should concentrate on the what and who.  It is juicy stuff after all.  Yet you would at least expect the serious analysts to publicise and comment on possible solutions - to develop a perspective.  Regrettably there has been little of that, which is a shame.</para><para>I do not speak as one coming recently to the fray.  For well over four years in submissions, minority reports articles and speeches I have proposed some solutions to our great problem of low political standards.  The Democrats have pushed these ideas in policy launches and issue sheets.</para><para>I start from a basic position.  That is that any country organisation or company rests on its constitutional foundations.  Get that right and good things can follow.  We take it as given that corporate behaviour reaches good standards overall because we have regulation, because we have corporations law, because we have company constitutions that work well because they must contain standard items. </para><para>Political parties do not rest on good constitutional foundations.  Electoral fraud, branch stacking, preselection rorts, bad political behaviour all have their genesis in bad political party regulation and law.</para><para>The focus of the current scandals has been on the conduct of individuals.  It also needs to be on solutions.</para><para>Without solutions we will not restore public faith in a system of government and politics badly discredited in the eyes of many.  Without solutions the players might be different next time, but the underlying problems and causes will be the same.</para><para>The starting point for the reform process must be an appreciation of the public nature of political parties.  Political parties are less regulated than corporations, unions and (in many respects) even the local tennis club. There is this awful myth that political parties are and should remain strictly private associations and that public scrutiny and regulation of their internal affairs is unwarranted.  This view needs to be emphatically rejected.</para><para>There are two grounds for rejecting the argument that political parties are private institutions and therefore immune from the demands of public accountability.  Overwhelmingly, the first is that political parties are now publicly funded in four of our nine parliaments, including federally.  The public has an absolute right not only to know how its money is being received and spent but who is spending it.  Transparency is required.</para><para>Secondly, and vitally, political parties are extensively and powerfully involved in public life.  They are capable of exercising enormous power that affects all Australians.  The public influence and purpose of political parties demands that they be open to scrutiny, be publicly accountable, and be run to the highest standards.</para><para>It is the nature of the power that is being exercised rather than the nature of the institution that is the crucial consideration.  There is a compelling public interest in the regulation of the exercise of public power irrespective of whether that power is exercised by private or public bodies.</para><para>Politicians are quite prepared to regulate other private bodies where the public interest so requires.  Corporations are subject to a much more stringent regulatory regime than political parties despite the fact that corporations are more `private' in nature and less `public' in their powers.   But when the question of regulating political parties is raised politicians assert this special freedom from regulation for private bodies.  This is a hopeless double standard presently asserted by the major parties to protect them from scrutiny.  It is time they changed tack.</para><para>For a number of years I have argued for a set of reforms that would bring political parties under the type of regulatory regime that befits their role in our system of democracy.</para><para>There are two aspects to these reforms. Firstly, the internal procedures of political parties must meet legally entrenched standards to ensure that the organisation operates democratically and fairly.  Secondly, the AEC must be given an expanded role as a regulatory authority. </para><para>The first step is amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act to require that standard items be set out in a party's constitution, similar to the corporations law requirements for the constitutions of companies. </para><para>Constitutions should be required to include the conditions and rules of party membership, how office-bearers are preselected and elected, how the preselection of candidates is to be conducted, the processes that exist for dispute resolution and processes for altering the constitution.  Parties would still be able to determine their own procedures in these areas, but certain minimum standards would be mandatory.  Parties should be obliged to constitutionally demonstrate to the AEC that their internal procedures satisfy basic standards of accountability and democracy.</para><para>Parties should only be able to register with the AEC if these minimum constitutional standards were met.  The AEC does presently ask for party constitutions, but their content is almost entirely discretionary.  The AEC has party constitutions that are 16 years old and have never been updated.</para><para>These constitutions are kept secret.  They should instead be public documents.  Public scrutiny and critical analysis will materially advance levels of fairness and internal democracy.</para><para>The AEC is already a regulator in a number of areas.  Its regulatory powers should be extended.  The AEC's main aim would be to encourage much better self-regulation against basic legislated principles.</para><para>Much of the internal corruption and impropriety that we hear about from time to time could be avoided if only there was the political will to confront the party machines and insist that reasonable standards of democracy and accountability be observed.  To date, the larger parties have shirked from their public duty to put these things right.</para><para>The Democrats have consistently pushed for reform in this area.  The regulation of political parties was an important part of our policy platform for the 1998 election, and a matter that I pursued in detail in my JSCEM minority report on the conduct of the 1996 election.  Senator Bartlett and I repeated the call in the 1998 report. </para><para>For those interested in detail I put an extensive range of (failed) amendments down on this topic in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (no 2) 1998.</para><para>In that Bill I proposed that the AEC be required to refuse an application for the registration of a political party if, in its opinion, the constitution of the party did not sufficiently provide for the affairs of the party to be conducted in an open, democratic and accountable manner.  Twenty criteria were proposed to structure the discretion of the AEC.  The same process was to apply to changes to party constitutions.</para><para>Under the amendments, copies of party constitutions would have been publicly available and the Electoral Commissioner would have been empowered to receive and investigate complaints of non-compliance with those constitutions.  All preselection ballots would have been conducted by the AEC to ensure that the process was carried out with integrity.</para><para>Now if the major parties want to change the content of my proposals, I would gladly discuss that.  For me the principle is unassailable, the detail can be negotiated.  However those amendments were voted down in an appalling example of vested interest in the status quo triumphing in the face of a demonstrated need for public accountability.</para><para>Political parties will continue to corrupt political processes until something is done about the systemic problems arising from poor party regulation.  It is no overstatement to say that the legitimacy of our political system is at stake.</para><para>There is a widespread perception that party politics is corrupt, dishonest, venal, immoral and unprincipled.  That perception inevitably compromises public faith in the political system in which parties operate. </para><para>It is time for the larger parties to muster the political courage to clean up the system.  This must begin with a recognition that political parties exercise public power and must be subject to public regulation.  The limited role I have proposed for the AEC is a balanced and fair approach that promotes self-regulation but ensures that there is a role for an independent regulator when that is required.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Library of Australia</title><page.no>20949</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>20949</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the government appointed member and longest serving member of the Council of the National Library of Australia, it gives me great pleasure tonight to speak to the library's annual report. The National Library of Australia is much more than a library. It is not just one of Australia's great cultural institutions but a national centre for Australian culture. The main function of the library is to maintain and develop the National Library collection, which includes not only booksâas a lot of people might thinkâbut also a vast array of multimedia materials relating to Australia and its people. </para></talk.start><para>As well as books, the National Library has a vast cultural collection conservatively valued at more than $3 billion. For example, the Sir Rex Nan Kivell Collection displayed last year contains a treasure-trove of books, paintings, charts and artefacts from the 19th century South Pacific. This collection in the National Library is so vast that the display area last year could only take three per cent of it. Another is the George Raper Collection. This historic group of materials involves drawings, maps and notes from the First Fleet. It is quite extraordinary that this material from our First Fleet people is now available to be viewed on the Internet, courtesy of the National Library of Australia. </para><para>One of the most fascinating and profound projects being undertaken currently by the National Library in terms of Australia and its culture is the response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. By the end of this year, the library is hoping, there will by 124 interviews completed and on record. The <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> oral history project is government funded and will eventually contain the voices of people involved in the separation of Aboriginal people from their families. When completed, I am sure this project will be one of the most powerful documents in our history.</para><para>In the early 1990s the National Library of Australia began to move into the information age with a range of programs that are now performing outstandingly well. Many diehard book lovers may cringe at the effect the information age is now having on libraries, but information technology can be of tremendous benefit to all Australiansânot just the people who can get to Canberra. Through information technology, the National Library is now more accessible than ever before. It is extremely important that this material be within the reach of all Australians. With the National Library of Australia's significant role in the collection of materials that relate to Australia and its people, information online can now be distributed very widely. Before information technology services, the National Library had a very limited customer base, but now through the Internet people from all over Australia can enjoy the vast cultural treasure-trove that the library has to offer, with just a click of their home PC mouse.  </para><para>Internet services have been very popular with library users, which is evident when you look at the demand for material in the various formats. For example, there has been a decrease of 11 per cent in the demand for printed material and an increase of 67 per cent in the use of electronic materials. An example of the move to the digital age is the national collection of Australian electronic publications initiative. Its aim is to ensure that Australian digital publications are available across the country and can be used for further research. In October last year, the library purchased a new software platform which will provide the basis of the digital services project. </para><para>Other initiatives that the library has undertaken to meet its online plans include the guide to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander materials, a reference service for integrated access to print and electronic information and a revised policy on digitalising the collections. One initiative that I took particular interest in is a new pictorial Internet service called `Picture Australia'âthis is free of chargeâwhich provides 24-hour access to the pictorial collections of some of Australia's leading cultural institutions. This project recently won a national award for best Internet site. The National Library is a host server and people using the Internet can look up visions of Australia and its history from a wide collection of resources. </para><para>I had the honour of launching the first NLA server in 1995, at the start of Internet services at the library. It is remarkable how far the National Library of Australia has come with web based technology since that time. It has been a good year for the library, and I welcome its efforts in incorporating the latest in information technology in the daily running of the library. Through the introduction of such services, the library is meeting the needs of Australians, particularly students, by making their resources widely available. </para><para>Given that this great Australian cultural institution is providing such a terrific service to our community, it is a pity that one person, Mr Robert Barnes, a lecturer in the classics department at the ANU, has carried out a one-man vendetta against the National Library of Australia for the last six years. He has taken his criticism of the library to great lengths, with venomous letters to local and national media, to the minister, to the library's council and to the library community. The core of his complaints lies in his disagreement with the library's policy of collecting overseas research material. This is despite nationwide consultation on this issue and the support of academics and other libraries for this policy. Mr Barnes, it seems, will not give up his vendetta. </para><para>Now, having failed to attract any support on the library collection policy, Mr Barnes has turned his criticism to the new Kinetica information system. Staff at the library have held a number of meetings with Mr Barnes to hear his complaints, but he continues to persist. His criticisms have become tiresome. Indeed, they are quite remarkable when he prints his letters of criticism on ANU letterheads and contributes so much of his time to his one-man vendetta. It is high time that Mr Barnes's ceaseless activity against the library stop. </para><para>On a brighter note, I wish to pay tribute to Jan Fullerton and Warren Horton, the Director-General and the former Director-General of the National Library, for their leadership over the last 16 years in steering the library through the explosion of knowledge and the most dramatic transformation in the technologies for delivering knowledge in human history. Australians should be proud of their National Library, which is comparable with any library anywhere around the world. In paying tribute to the library, Professor Geoffrey Bolton from Murdoch University recently gave a speech on the 100th anniversary of the National Library. He said that evidence of the high quality, versatility and imagination in the way that the National Library of Australia serves the public can be measured by a civilised society that produces such an institution and the public and private sectors that give such institutions practical and moral support. The National Library of Australia is an outstanding institution and I urge the ongoing support of the public and the private sector for the services that it provides the nation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>âFrom the chair, I wish to acknowledge Senator Murray's assistance in resolving a difficult situation for the Senate.

The student is entitled to the interest earned on the amount to be refunded. The amount arrived at is the minimum refund payable.

They can continue to study with the same teachers, at the same building, with the same services from the same staff.  2. WILC will arrange for the students `change of provider' process without charging the fee, which is $120 for each application."</para><para>	(3) The proposed partnership was not approved by the NSW Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Board, the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs or the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</para><para>	(4) The National ELT Accreditation Scheme (NEAS) is a delegated authority of the NSW Vocational Education Accreditation Board (VETAB) under the Vocational Education and Training Accreditation (Amendment) Act 1993 (VETA (Amendment) Act ) to accredit providers as ELICOS institutions.  NEAS has advised the following: </para><para>	Vision College Pty Ltd has never made application to NEAS for accreditation as an ELICOS institution.  Wesley Mission made application to NEAS for provisional accreditation for the institution Wesley Institute for Ministry and the Arts under the provider name Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) for Wesley Mission, which was granted on 11 October 1996.  Under its authority delegated by VETAB under the VETA (Amendment) Act, NEAS concurrently approved Wesley Mission's ELICOS courses for registration  on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).</para><para>	In July 1999, application was made for a change of trading name of the institution to Wesley Institute for Language and Commerce (WILC).  Documentation provided on 3 March 2000 indicated that the trading name was owned by The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NSW) for Wesley Mission.  The change in trading name was confirmed by NEAS as part of the conditions of accreditation on 19 June 2000.</para><para>	NEAS was advised on 17 August 2000 that WILC was no longer offering ELICOS courses.  Its NEAS accreditation was revoked on 22 August 2000.  VETAB was advised of this.</para><para>	WILC has never been registered by VETAB.  Ms Ong may offer education services to overseas students only under an arrangement made by a registered provider.</para><para>	(5) Vision College has never been registered on CRICOS.  Ms Ong may offer education services to overseas students only under an arrangement made by a registered provider.</para><para>	(6) DIMA has advised that the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) has no record of Vision College or any of its principals having been registered as migration agents.  Section 280 of the Migration Act 1958 applies restrictions on giving immigration assistance and states that a person who is not a registered agent must not give immigration assistance, with some limited exemptions.  DIMA investigators have received anecdotal information that marketing personnel at Wesley Institute of Language and Commerce (Vision College) known as "Client Service Managers" were providing immigration assistance beyond what would normally be accepted as educational services.  DIMA investigators have interviewed former teachers and a former student in relation to the operation of WILC.  These interviews have been conducted to obtain evidence of any offences including the provision of unregistered migration assistance.  Further interviews with former teachers and students are scheduled.  Investigators will be approaching the owner of the college, Ms Rachel Ong and her associates when sufficient evidence has been obtained.  A referral to MARA is not considered appropriate given that the allegations relate to unregistered practice, not breaches of MARA's code of conduct.</para><para>	(7)	(a) An extract from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission database shows that the business status of Mr Jommer Education Centre, V4961707 is recorded as "ceased" effective from 9 June 2000.</para><para>	(b) DETYA has no knowledge of the Mr Jommer Education Centre, NSW V4961707 or whether it has offered services to overseas students.  DIMA has advised that DIMA investigators have been informed by a former employee of Mr Sommer (Jommer) Enterprises Pty Ltd that the agency ceased trading on 7 August 2000.</para><para>	(c) DETYA has no knowledge of the Mr Jommer Education Centre (NSW 4961707) or of the services it might offer to overseas students.  DIMA has advised that the former employee advised that Mr Sommer (Jommer) Enterprises Pty Ltd was operating as an education consultant dealing mainly with Korean  students.  There is also information that two Chinese females were using the same premises to provide an education consultancy to Chinese students.</para><para>	(d) DIMA has advised that there is no substantive evidence that Mr Sommer (Jommer) Enterprises Pty Ltd (MSE) was providing unregistered migration assistance.  Six former clients of MSE have been contacted by DIMA investigators to date.  All have stated that MSE only charged them the DIMA student lodgement fee of $290, (which they passed onto DIMA).  Other monies paid were in relation to locating suitable colleges and payment of tuition fees.  The matter is in the hands of the New South Wales Police Service (NSWPS) Fraud Unit with whom DIMA investigators have been liaising.  DIMA investigators have copied information referred to the NSWPS and placed it on file in case DIMA action is warranted in the future.  The principals of MSE have departed Australia and are therefore not available to be interviewed by DIMA investigators.  This matter has not been reported to MARA by DIMA as MSE were not registered migration agents. </para><para>	(e) The Department does not have access to information relating to any outstanding liabilities to education providers.</para><para>	(8) On 15 August 2000 DIMA received a complaint from a Korean student who had paid her college tuition fees to Mr Sommer (Jommer) Enterprises Pty Ltd (MSE) and later found that MSE had ceased business without transferring her fees to her college.  On 18 August 2000 DIMA investigators attended MSE and found the office deserted.  That same day investigators spoke to a former employee of MSE who informed them that many students had been defrauded; the principal of MSE, KIM Yong Suk, had fled Australia with the students' money and that the NSWPS Fraud Unit had been informed.  DIMA investigators liaised with NSWPS officers and established that many students appeared to have been defrauded.  NSWPS officers have spoken to several informants but are awaiting detailed information from a student representative or an accountant prior to launching a full investigation.  DIMA investigators have obtained copies of documents forwarded to NSWPS by affected students.  DIMA investigators are not making any pro-active enquires which may compromise the NSWPS investigation.  As this complaint was in relation to the alleged criminal activities of an education consultant, NSWPS Fraud Unit is the most appropriate body to take action in the first instance.  VETAB have not been briefed as there is no evidence of any college's collusion in the fraud.  Student Compliance and Student Investigations are monitoring any trends relating to affected students.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Health and Aged Care: Complaints and Compliance Taskforce</title><page.no>20981</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2897)</subtitle><id.no>2897</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20981</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 7 September 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Can details be provided of meetings chaired by Ms Jenny Hefford (Complaints and Compliance Taskforce, Department of Health and Aged Care) on 16 May 2000 and 20 July 2000, held at the New South Wales Office of the Department of Health and Aged Care.</para><para>	(2) For each meeting, can the following be provided: (a) the purpose of the meeting;  (b) the list of invitees and how this list was determined (please advise whether the selection of consumer representatives was in accordance with department policy); (c) attendance list and apologies; and (d) minutes of the meetings; if minutes were not taken, why not.</para><para>	(3) At the meeting of 16 May 2000, what information was provided to consumer representatives about the department's process<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>for dealing with serial complaints to the Complaints Resolution Scheme.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20981</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In accordance with advice provided to her:</para><para>	(1) A meeting was held to consult on a service charter for the Complaints Resolution Scheme and a follow up meeting was held to go through issues raised in the previous meeting. </para><para>	(2)	(a) See (1) </para><para>	(b) and (c)  Representation from groups and individuals with a direct interest in the Complaints Resolution Scheme.
