Will the minister inform the Senate of levels of industrial disputes in the Australian workplace?

The facts are that, under the coalition government, the number of work days lost per thousand has more than halved. In other words, when Labor was in office, an average of 190 working days were lost per thousand employees. Under us, the figure is now down to 92 working days. That clearly demonstrates that a lot of other beneficial consequences flow to ordinary workers. For example, during the last six years of Labor there were almost 400,000 new jobs created, 27,000 of which were full time. Under us, there have been nearly 700,000 new jobs created, and 381,000 of those are full-time jobs. Youth unemployment under Labor was 27.2 per cent when it left office. It is now barely above 20 per cent. Job insecurity levels have stabilised, after hitting their peak in 1992 under Labor. Quite clearly the level of increase in real wages has been of enormous benefit to ordinary workers. </para></talk.start><para>So why is it that this crowd over here are happy playing in the sandpit, burying their heads in the sand and not wanting to face up to reality? Why is it that they want to go back to the bad old days of secondary boycotts, industrial disputes and the law of the jungle? Why do they endorse people like Dean Mile who get out there and say that they do not regard any order of the IRC with which they disagree as legitimate? In other words, if they are told to return to work and they do not like it, they will not go back. If he is ordered to pay a fine he will not pay it. Senator Lundy might be particularly interested in this: if you visit the ALP homepage you will see some fascinating points made there, such as, `From its inception, the presence and activity of the trade unions has been vital to the ALP.' We all know that hundred million dollars in electoral contributions has made an enormous difference; `Particularly over the last 20 years there has been a steady improvement in the relationship between Labor's parliamentary parties and the trade unions'âagain, dead right; and, `In 1980 only 30 per cent of Labor senators had union backgrounds. Now the figure is closer to 70 per cent.' So it is a very close relationship indeed. It is very productive if you want a career path. If you want to be Michael Costa you say, `I've done my time. I've run the unions for a couple of years; I now demand to be state Treasurer.' That is the sort of attitude that you getâa natural career progression. If you cannot get a job in the real world you go and work for the unions for a few years, feather your nest, line up a few mates and in you goâlifetime employment.</para><para>It is a disgraceful state of affairs. I can well recall, for example, Mr Clinton, when he was elected to office, saying that he wanted a cabinet that looked liked America. You know what the ALP will say when they get into government, if they ever do: they want a cabinet that looks like the ACTU, probably like the John Curtin Hotel front bar. In other words, they simply want to see less than 20 per cent of the private sector represented by about 60 per cent of parliamentarians who are former trade union officials. No wonder they hang their heads in shame. No wonder they are not game to face up to the facts. No wonder they pretend they are not listening to the issue, because they are not prepared to argue. They could easily interject, they could take points of order and they could complain about the facts but, of course, they have no defence. That is the tragedy of it, and the Australian people understand this. The workers of Australia understand it. The last thing they want is to go back to wildcat strikes, strike pay, secondary boycottsâthe usual industrial turmoil. They have not had it under us and they will not get it in the future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aboriginals: Living Conditions</title><page.no>14642</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14642</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat a lot of babble!

In relation to the first part, I would refer Senator Bolkus to the latest indigenous housing report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. What I said then, I stand by. Interestingly enough, I stand by it. Senator Bolkus would not know because he reads the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the metropolitan press. He does not go out to remote communities. He would not have a clue. He is writing down that he has been to one. He said here in the Senate that he had been to one. The reality is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey shows, for example, that three per cent of the Aboriginal communities in remote areas are living in improvised dwellings. Which government put in the Army ATSIC program? Which government has taken positive action over the last four years with a program to solve the problems of Aboriginal communities, which were neglected by the Labor Party for the 13 years that they had something to do about it? They did little or nothing. Now they are dragging something out that I said in the <inline font-style="italic">Toowoomba Chronicle </inline>four years ago, which I stand by. </para></talk.start><para>The other thing that Senator Bolkus is probably not aware of is the definition of what he is referring to, and I would refer him to what he is talking about: Third World conditions. I would suggest that he go and look that up. It is not my place to educate him. He has the capability to check that himself. The reality is that an enormous amount has been achieved in the time that we have been in office, particularly in relation to Aboriginal health, to the provision of water, to education, to housing and to employment. The Community Development Employment Program was instituted by the Fraser government. The coalition has done more for Aboriginal affairs, instead of, as Senator Bolkus and his party do, working the system, talking about it in the metropolitan areas and not getting out to the remote communities, where there are definite improvements occurring and which have been occurring since the Commonwealth, and I will pay some due to the Labor Party in that regard. But where I do not pay regard to the Labor Party is their using Aboriginal affairs as a political football. That is what they are doing. They are using it as a political football. They had 13 years to do something about it and they devoted nothing to it. It was run by the Left of Senator Bolkus's party and used as a political issue. They did nothing in a concrete way to address the real issues of health, housing, education and employment. </para><para>We stand by what we set out to do. I would again refer Senator Bolkus to the beginning of my answer and ask that he check the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey with regard to housingâwhich I launched, and he was not atâand look at the fact that only three per cent of the Aboriginal community are now living in improvised dwellings. There has been an enormous amount of effort put into it. I am having discussions with ATSIC at the moment so that we can have a 10-year program. It will not be solved overnight. We have had four years to address the problems of the pastâfour years to overcome the disadvantage that Aboriginal people have suffered. We acknowledge that disadvantage. All of us recognise the disadvantage that they have. But we have a program to do something about itâsomething that was totally neglected by the Labor Party in the 13 years that they had to do something about it.

During the March quarter more than 187,000 people took out private health insurance. This is the largest ever surge in private health insurance membership and represents a massive vote of confidence in the government's reforms of an industry that was left to decay by the previous Labor government. Labor almost destroyed health services, as Senator Knowles said, and we are fixing the mess. The increase in the March quarter is the fifth consecutive quarterly increase in participation rates since the introduction of the 30 per cent rebateâthe fifth successive increase. This has never happened since private health participation figures were first published in quarterly form in 1989. The largest increase was in the 30 to 34 age group, which recorded an increase of over 21,000. Since the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate in 1998, almost half a million Australians have taken out private health insurance. Today 32.7 per cent of the population are covered by private health insurance. You may be interested to know, Senator Hill, that we have support from an unexpected quarter.

The tax treatment of planting new timber is generally subject to the ordinary provisions of the tax act.

However, it is important to note that the government has specific tax legislation to encourage environmentally friendly expenditureâand I think that sort of expenditure, Senator, is the sort of expenditure that you would strongly support. For example, the government allows an immediate deduction for expenditure, whether capital or revenue, incurred for the sole or dominant purpose of carrying on an environmental protection activity. The government allows a deduction over 10 years for certain expenditure incurred on environmental impact assessment.

That is all it is at the moment. It is not resiling from the original decision. The original decision stands. But Senator Hill, as I understand it, has asked for a further report to see whether there is some legitimacy in extending the time limit in relation to the waterskiing aspect of it.

The answer to the first part of that supplementary question is that I do not believe that it is overthrowing the decision at all. As I said, I put a temporary order in so that we can get a resolution, because it is an area where there is a fair amount of racial tension, as you would recognise. I do not believe it will be helped by overturning that decision. All that Senator Hill has done is request another report. So let us take it one step at a time so that we can get a resolution that will be satisfactory. Part of the debate, for example, concerns recognition of the historical aspects of Boobera and a museum there which will incorporate the Aboriginal historical aspects and artefacts of the area and can then become a major tourist attraction for Goondiwindi. I have been to the Goondiwindi council and discussed it with them, and they are all in favour.

Notwithstanding Minister Hockey's press release, if you actually turn to his guidelines, it makes it quite clear that at a minimum business must `comply with the standards that are listed below of the Privacy Commissioner'. So, on the one hand, he is trying to distance himself from this appalling breach of trust by the government and the ATO by blaming the Privacy Commissioner's laws and guidelines rather than his own; at the same time, he fails to have even read his own guidelines in which he directs that business, as part of his guidelines, comply with the Privacy Commissioner. He tries to pretend that they are nothing to do with each other. His own best practice guidelines actually contain the principles that the Privacy Commissioner has set out. They are written there in black and white inside his own guidelines. </para></talk.start></continue><para>However, what Mr Hockey has revealed is that his best guidelines are clearly a farce. According to Mr Hockey, if you buy the email details of a business and you promise as part of your disclosure not to send spams to the person whose email you have bought, then it is okay to onsell the email and the person who buys it from you can spam them. Wow! What fantastic guidelines Mr Hockey has been prepared to get into! Senator Kemp has come into the chamber and defended this position. Sections 23 and 40 make it clear that you should advise businesses how you will handle their information and that customers should have the choice to say no to onselling. These are the best practice guidelines. What the tax office have not done is give the option of choice to people whose emails they collected. They have not been prepared to put a box there to say, `Do you mind if we onsell your email?' Doctors have contacted meâthey have all been required to electronically lodge. They do not want their patients to have their email address, because it is not secure for medical information to be transmitted by email. There are genuine concerns in the community.

Senator Kemp said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Today we contacted the Deputy Privacy Commissioner to determine whether in their view there had been a breach of the Privacy Act.</para><para>Their initial response was that there had been a breach because of their view that we have not made people aware that we were authorised by law to collect information under the ABN application process. </para><para>We then directed him to what we believe are clear statements of authority in the application kit.</para><para>The Deputy Privacy Commissioner said they would consider whether in the light of this they remained of the view that there had been a breach. </para></quote><para>In response to the other matters raised by Senator Conroy in relation to the GST, yesterday we had the spectre of Senator Conroy in here speaking in the committee stage of a bill. He was most determined to amend the bill to make sure that the GST as it applied to any sales or purchases was actually shown on the receipt. This was a most important principle as far as Senator Conroy was concerned.</para><para>This is the same Senator Conroy who did everything he could in his power to make sure that the existing wholesale sales tax was never put on a receipt. For 13 years the Labor government went on with the out-of-date wholesale sales tax system we have at present and did not want anybody to know how much tax they were paying. I know that Senator George Campbell, in his determination to make sure that the people know everything about what is going on with taxation, would have wanted that wholesale sales tax amount to be displayed. But even Senator George Campbell did not ever in the time he has been here move to have sales tax put on the docket of a receipt so that people would know how much indirect tax they were paying. That is the sort of confusion that exists in the Labor Party. They want the GST put on the docket so that people know what they are paying but they did not ever and still do not want anybody to know how much wholesale sales tax is being paid.</para><para>Not only that. The Woolworths document we had put before us yesterday and tabled by Senator Murray details the amount of GST that will be paid on a docket. But nowhere on that docket does it say how much the items that were previously subject to a wholesale sales tax had decreased. You have this misleading docket that says, `This much GST has been collected,' but nowhere does it say how much the prices have been reduced on items which had attracted a wholesale sales tax under the current legislation. The ALP still hate this GST so much that they are determined to keep it. They have this airy-fairy idea that they will `roll back the worst features'. Nobody knows whether the roll-back will occur. We do not believe it will because in their heart of hearts the ALP are very happy that this government is introducing a GST. Doug Cameron of the AMWU knows how much he wants it rolled back. He wants it rolled back `a long way'. Not only does he want it rolled back but he want different rates. He is not satisfied with having one rate for a GST. He wants to have more rates. I can only presume that, if they follow Doug Cameron, the Labor Party will have the 10 per cent rate and for some goods they will have an even higher rate. We can only assume that is what Doug Cameron of the AMWU wants. He says that there should not be a flat tax; there must be a varying rate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>14656</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also want to take note of the answers given today by Senator Kemp in relation to the GST.

You have used the ACCC, which is supposed to be an independent body and which is supposed to be out there protecting the interests of the consumer, as a price watchdogâas a policeman for the implementation of your goods and services tax.

What has it done in terms of compliance with the GST legislation by other huge retailers? Nothing.

How do we value having an extensive and reliable news and current affairs service in this region, by people in this region for people in this region?

The only way they can be brought back on line again will be if Radio Australia can pay more money for those transmitters, which of course are much more expensive to run than Cox Peninsula because they hire them from a foreign transmitter service. So where is that money coming from? Does Radio Australia have it? No, they do not have it. Does the ABC have that money to pay for those transmitters? No. The ABC is vastly underfunded by this government, the ABC is abysmally underfunded by this government, and it is an absolute crime the way the ABC is underfunded by this government. So where will this money come from? It does not look like it is going to come from anywhere.

This government has sold Australia's national interest through selling that hardware and through leasing that site, with absolutely no interest in Australia's position or reputation in this region, with no interest in allowing the people of this regionâthe ordinary people of South-East Asiaâto know what is going on around them.</para><para>Unless something happens with this Cox Peninsula site that will allow Radio Australia to transmit from it, those people will now get their news and their current affairs service from the likes of the BBC World Service, which, understandably, does not have a focus on Asia and does not have a focus on our region.

The service will come from the likes of Voice of Malaysia.

What sort of influence do we want to have in Asia? At the moment we are cutting ourselves off. Australia is whispering to the world. Australia is not even going to be whispering into Asia; we will have no voice in Asia. It seems to me that this government has no interest in whether or not that is the case.

no. 576.</para></motion><para>I note at the outset the objection to this matter being voted upon by the Labor Party and its previously stated reasons for that. However, this motion simply notes an event and an expression of a wish by the unanimous assembly of 3,000 delegates held in Jayapura, the capital of West Papua, in the last week for independence for the purpose of establishing the future of West Papua. I also note that the Labor Party has on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>a very important motion relating to the overthrow of democracy in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands. I inform the Senate that the Greens will not be blocking the passage of that motion to a vote because it is quite proper that the Senate should vote on such a matter. We do not take the prescriptive attitude of the Labor Party, allowing the Senate to move expeditiously on matters of urgent importance so that messages can be sent where they need to be to intervene on behalf of democracy, human rights and the environment elsewhere in the world.</para><para>If this motion were successful, it would simply be a motion letting the Indonesian authorities, including President Wahid, know that the Australian Senate recognises that the meeting of West Papuan leaders took place and that they decided to call for independence. Of itself, the motion is not an endorsement of that call, although I as a Green member of parliament thoroughly endorse the right of the West Papuan people to their day in the sun, their human rights, their right to independence and, basically, their right to self-determination. Is the coalition or the opposition going to stand here today and deny two million West Papuans their right to self-determination? I have a lot of respect for the President of Indonesia, President Wahid, but if reports in today's Australian press are correct, wherein he said that the majority of West Papuans are opposed to independence, I start to see that respect eroded.</para><para>President Wahid knows, like successive Australian governments have known, that that is not true. Everybody knows. Recent documents relating back to the awesome events of the 1960s, when the Australian government turned its back on the aspirations of West Papuans, make it very clear that Australian delegates in West Papua knew that more than 95 per cent of West Papuans wanted their independence. Yet it went along with the sham that denied these people that right. These are our nearest neighbours. This is a nation that has had its rights suppressed. It is time Australian politicians had the backbone to stand up for democratic rights, human rights and aspirations for self-determination when people express them. I find it a total derogation of commitment by the members of the big parties in this place to the basic and fundamental aspiration for freedom, endorsed by the Australian people, when they repeatedly deny the aspirations of the West Papuan people, our nearest neighbours.</para><para>I am going to push this debate in this place. I will not have our backs turned on these people. They deserve their right to express their own opinions. And if President Wahid is right and the majority do not want independence, let him put it to a referendum as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>14662</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition do oppose formality of this motion. As Senator Brown indicated, the reasons we oppose the passage without debate of a motion have been stated a number of times. Simply put, the Labor Party will not be supporting this motion. I understand the government will not be supporting this motion. In relation to Senator Brown's contribution, there is nothing that indicated this motion was urgent. The Labor Party are quite happy to debate this motion in the general business time that Senator Brown might devote to this when his opportunity arises. He is quite at liberty to do that. But there is nothing in Senator Brown's contribution that indicated why this matter is urgent. It is, after all, simply asking the Senate to acknowledge the statement that is attributed to the Congress of West Papuans. But, of course, the acknowledgment of that by the Senate would have ramifications beyond the determination by the West Papuans. Simply put, we will not be supporting the suspension and Senator Brown will have the opportunity to pursue this matter at another time, because it clearly is not urgent. </para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I would like my sole vote supporting the motion recorded.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âIt is now recorded, as you have made a statement.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COX PENINSULA TRANSMITTER: SALE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>14663</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crossin</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	condemns the Federal Government's decision to sell Australia's most powerful short-wave transmitter at Cox Peninsula in the Northern Territory to the British-based Christian Voice International;</para><para>	(b)	notes that this decision betrays Australia's national interests in Asia; and</para><para>	(c)	calls on the Government to ensure that a reliable and easily accessible source of Australian news and information is available to people in the region by securing air time for Radio Australia to broadcast to Indonesia and South East Asia.</para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SPENCER GULF AIR CRASH</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>14663</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGauran </inline>at the request of<inline font-weight="bold"> Senator Ferguson</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	expresses:</para><para>	(i)	great sadness and sincere regret at the tragic loss of Whyalla Airlines flight 904 on 31 May 2000 in Spencer Gulf in South Australia, and</para><para>	(ii)	its deepest sympathy to the families of the pilot and passengers, and to the communities of the northern Spencer Gulf and Eyre Peninsula that have been so profoundly affected by the tragedy; and</para><para>	(b)	notes the outstanding effort of emergency services and volunteers in their search and rescue operations in difficult conditions.</para></motion></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FIJI AND SOLOMON ISLANDS: POLITICAL CRISES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>14663</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>14663</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask that general business notice of motion No. 579 standing in my name for today, relating to the overthrow of democracy in Fiji and the attempted overthrow of the government of the Solomon Islands be taken as a formal motion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I seek to make a point of order.

A concern that was raised by many people during the Senate inquiry was that the proposed gap cover schemes were a bit of an unknown quantity and it was unclear how they would work in practice. The principal concern was that the schemes would result in fee inflation and, as a consequence, push up health insurance premiums. The doctors argued that this was not the intention and that if this happened the scheme would have failed. Consumers, however, were concerned that the benefits of gap schemes would not be delivered and that a form of financial consent would not be provided. </para><para>The Catholic Health Association proposed a review of the scheme after 12 months, while the Australian Health Insurance Association went further and wanted a sunset clause on the arrangements to ensure that there was a greater incentive for doctors to moderate their negotiating position. The opposition has considered both arguments and has decided that the gap cover schemes need a longer period to prove themselves but that a full review is necessary to ensure that the goals set out for gap cover schemes are in fact achieved. The medical community needs to be on notice that the obligation lies with them to get gap cover schemes to work.</para><para>The proposed mechanism in our amendment is that an independent inquiry be established after two years of operationâthat is, in July 2002âand that a written report be provided by the minister to parliament by December of that year. This broad review is separate to the minister's power to individually review schemes which fail to comply with their conditions of approval. The intention is that the two-year review should look at the broad picture and examine whether gap cover schemes have achieved a sufficient market penetration. The government has set no target for the anticipated penetration of no gap and known gap schemes by which the review could judge the success of those schemes. Currently, about 16 per cent of all claims are made as part of the existing no gap schemes. The opposition would hope that, if these schemes were successful in the way that their promoters have argued, over 50 per cent of all medical claims by mid-2002 would be part of these schemes. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>14665</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Chair, as this is the start of the committee stage of this legislation, I would like to say something in a broad sense whilst supporting the proposal that has been made by the opposition for the legislation. I think that, as has been recognised in the debate thus far, the legislation, although recognising the need for medical gap cover by health funds, still lacks the rigorous framework which will provide certainty for customers when they approach medical specialists. This is one of the things that I have been concerned about for some considerable time. In other words, the legislation does not guarantee that doctors will provide no gap cover. Consumers will still be at the mercy of their particular specialist's disposition as to whether to provide the no gap cover. The absence of a contract or commercial arrangement between the health fund and the medical specialist will mean that, at best, the benefit for consumers will arise out of the operations of the health care market. People who are sick are not at their best as consumers in the health care marketâwe all know that. They are at the mercy of their specialists and do not have the capacity, or even the time, to shop around to find those specialists who will provide them with medical gap cover. That is particularly the case where specialist services are very limitedâfor example, in the regional areas. It is important that legislation such as this should safeguard consumers and not defer to the orthodoxy of market economics as the solution.</para></talk.start><para>There is an inconsistency in this legislation with the imperative that hospitals and health funds must have contractual arrangements. There is no logical reason whatsoever why health funds and doctors are not treated in the same fashion as hospitals and health funds to ensure that no gaps exist for consumers. It is common knowledge that doctors already provide pensioners and other low income people with bulk-billed private services. This means, of course, that those consumers pay no gap. This legislation will actually increase the payment to doctors for these consumers for no extra gain to consumersâthe status quo will remain. Doctors' reimbursements will increase. This will put significant inflationary pressure on the eventual price of health insurance. As we know, increased prices for health insurance become counterproductive in attracting people to insurance.</para><para>We will need to monitor the uptake of gap cover products by doctors to ensure that there are more consumers, other than those who are already receiving bulk-billed services, actually being offered no gap cover to justify, even in a minimal way, this legislation. I notice that Senator Evans is proposing, in the amendment that is currently before us, a review of the operation of the act. That will be absolutely essential to see whether people are playing the game properly. But the legislation does lack any robust mechanism to monitor the inflationary impact of medical gap cover. There is a very real danger that doctors will offer medical gap cover to patients and consumers whom they previously have bulk-billed and will only offer known gap cover to other consumers in order to maximise their reimbursements. Both these trends will lead to the overall inflation of private health costs and will place increasing pressure on opening up new gaps in medical fees. The government has not accompanied this legislation with a sensible and workable mechanism to monitor the inflationary impacts and to put in place a far more sound and reasonable commercial arrangement that not only provides consumers with more certainty but will better manage the inflationary pressures this legislation brings to the fore. Senator Evans's amendment relating to the review of the operation of the act will, I hope, set some sort of machinery in motion by which the minister will be required to have an independent reviewer undertake a review of the operation of gap cover schemes after this measure has been in operation for 12 months, or is it two years, Senator Evans?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âTwo yearsâin 2002.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>âThe independent review is defined as one undertaken by persons who `in the Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review' and it will `include one or more persons who are not employed by a registered organisation, the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority'. I support that. I am just wondering whether it should be after a year's operation and whether the committee, on reflection, would consider that to be appropriate. Other than that, I would be interested to hear why it is necessary for the review not to take place until after two years of operation. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>14666</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate that Senator Harradine has taken this opportunity to raise various issues and to alert us to his concerns.

Senator Harradine, can I refer you to yesterday evening's debate with respect to most of the issues you have raised.

In addressing some remarks to the amendment, I said that we had thought about it, because there are a couple of propositions on this issue. I think the Catholic Health Association suggested a time period of 12 months. A couple of other parties had various other propositions, including a sunset clause. On balance, we took the view that two years would allow a proper period for the schemes to work before a review and that 12 months might be a bit short. I do not think we would die in a ditch over it, but on balance we came to the view that two years would allow a good period of time in which a proper assessment could be made and that 12 months might be a bit on the short side in terms of making that proper assessment. These things are arbitrary, as you know.</para></talk.start><para>Also, we wanted to note that the minister has the ability to review and approve individual schemes and that that sort of process will be ongoing.

We are certainly of a mind to support the amendment. </para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>14667</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move opposition amendment No. 2:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (after line 19), before section 73BDD, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">73BDDA  Purpose of gap cover schemes</inline></para><quote><para>		The purpose of a gap cover scheme is to enable a registered organisation to offer insurance coverage for the cost of particular hospital treatment and associated professional attention for the person or persons insured where:</para><para>	(a)	the cost of the treatment or attention is greater than the Schedule fee (within the meaning of Part II of the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act 1973</inline>) for the treatment or attention; and</para><para>	(b)	there is not a hospital purchaser-provider agreement, a medical purchaser-provider agreement or a practitioner agreement between the registered organisation and the service provider concerned; and</para><para>	(c)	the person insured pays a specified amount or percentage under a known gap policy or the full cost of the treatment or attention is covered under a no gap policy.</para></quote><para>The bill inserts various sections into the Health Insurance Act 1973.

There are several important criteria advanced by the proponents of these schemes which are not otherwise written into the bill. The purpose of this amendment is to crystallise the objectives of gap cover schemes so that it is apparent to those who have not been a party to the process of the development of the bill, including the Senate inquiry, what the purposes are. We think that the amendment gives more clarity to the bill, spells out exactly the purpose of gap cover schemes and is a useful amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>14667</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be supporting this amendment.

However, I want to make a few remarks on this amendment. This amendment inserts a regulation specifying what an inflationary im-pact is. We see one of the basic risks of gap cover schemesâin the form that they are pro-vided for in this billâas being that they might have an inflationary impact on doctors' fees and health insurance premiums. This is a subject that I covered at length in my speech during the second reading debate. These schemes will only work if both sides are restrained and if additional payments made by health funds above the Medicare schedule fee are offset by a reduction or elimin-ation of gap charges above the level of refund.</para><para>All the parties who appeared before the Sen-ate legislation committee hearing said that they were strongly committed to this prin-ciple. Dr Brand of the AMA said, as I quoted in my speech during the second read-ing debate, that if there was an inflationary effect the schemes would have failed and the minister would be entitled to revoke them. The opposition welcomes those statements of commitment and is willing to support this leg-islation on the understanding that there will not be an inflationary impact. However, there is a major problem in that nowhere is an inflationary impact defined. Health funds and doctors have no guidance as to what is an acceptable level of increase or how the combined impact of premium rises and changes in gap payments is to be judged.  </para><para>This amendment provides for the minister to adopt regulations to specify and index a method for assessing the inflationary impact of schemes and will ensure that all parties are put on a level footing. It is important that the health funds know in advance what degree of latitude they have to negotiate and it is important for doctors to be able to assess the extent to which gap fees will need to be amended under a known gap scheme where the health fund is making a payment above the MBS rate. Without the regulations provided for through this amendment, there would be no benchmark and potentially no cap on what some would argue to be non-inflationary. So we think this is a very important amendment to deal with this question of the inflationary impact. We do not want to see any benefits from this eaten away by measures which will drive up inflation and drive up the cost of premiums or the cost of medical services. We think it is a very important amendment, and we hope to get support of this chamber for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>14668</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe will be supporting this amendment. In-deed, we will be moving an amendment after this to further deal with the issue of inflation, because it is not just a risk for patients, it is also a risk for the public purse. If fee inflation does occur, we will get higher costs to consumers and, with the 30 per cent rebate in operation, we will see that the government will be expending considerably more in their rebate program. So I think this is certainly necessary. As I said, I will deal with it further in a moment when we move another amendment to deal further with this issue.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>14668</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support this amendment.

I want to deal with these parts separately now. Part (a) is the one I just mentioned as we were dealing with the related amendment from the ALP. Our amendment actually requires that regulations be made under this bill to include specific provisions related to inflation. In other words, basically the Minister for Health and Aged Care has to be satisfied that these schemes will not be fee inflationary before approval is actually given for that particular scheme. I think it is very important that the schemes are monitored as to their inflationary impact.</para><para>In the second part of our amendment we are dealing with an issue that just over the last couple of years has become a bigger and bigger issue which has been raised with us by a number of people in the medical profession and also by consumer groups. This is the concern that, where someone in themedical profession refers on to another, perhaps a specialist, for an additional consultation, there be no financial interest, that the first-mentioned person does not have any financial interest in the product or service that he or she is recommending people move on and receive. Under this legislation we can attach this only to the gap cover issue, but we will in future legislation be attaching it more broadly to health legislation so that this applies more broadly across the board in the health field. It is to deal with the problem of vertical integration.  </para><para>Looking at the difficulty this government and past governments have had containing costs in a number of areas, legislation was brought in under the last Labor government dealing with practices by doctors that were in fact overservicing. I believe we have a real issue growing where the drive for overservicing is not so much at the provision of service end but at the end where we have a referral based on a commercial interest. In other words, we are backtracking to look at the vertical integration in the health system. I have to stress here that obviously the vast majority of medical professionals would consider only the patient's best interest, but the possibility is there that financial concerns can at least influence where the patient is sent for the next round of diagnostic tests or for the operation. So I think the second part of this amendment is vital to make sure that Australia does not head down the road that some others have headed down in the area of private medicine.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>14669</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I mentioned in the debate earlier, the government will be accepting the amendment proposed by the Democrats.

I said last evening:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The approval process provided for in the legislation contains a number of protective measures that will ensure that gap cover schemes deliver maximum benefit to consumers. Most importantly, the legislation ensures that no scheme will be approved unless the health fund can demonstrate that it will not have an inflationary impact. This information will have to be provided to the minister in detail in the fund's application for scheme approval. It is worth noting that this legislation introduces protective mechanisms that do not apply to current agreements to address the gap. The current measures to address the gap which were introduced by the opposition do not address the issue of the inflationary impact at all. In contrast, this measure has been designed very deliberately to ensure that inflationary impacts are not felt throughout the health system as a result of measures to address the gap. </para></quote><para>I believe that we can therefore accept the amendment that has been put forward, which reinforces that particular point.</para><para>The second part of the Democrat amendment, which deals with the area of requiring a doctor providing hospital treatment under a gap cover scheme to disclose to the insured person any financial interest that the doctor has in any products and services recommended or given to the insured person, the government accepts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14669</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Labor opposition, I indicate that we also support this amendment. I have already discussed the question of the inflationary impact. That part of the amendment is consistent with the approach which Labor has taken to the bill. I also think that the provision about declaration of other interests is very useful. It is an issue I took up with the department and the HIC in Senate estimates a week or so ago, regarding some complaints about activity going on in Western Australia in particular about corporatisation of health, the role of GPs and their relationship to other services. It is an emerging issue in medicine in this country. I think the principles contained in the Democrat amendment are worthy ones which will be useful in ensuring that the needs of the patient is the paramount issue in determining other services, rather than the corporate relationship of the parties involved. We support the amendment as a useful addition.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>14669</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(4)	Schedule 1, item 6 (after line 18), at the end of section 73BDD, add:</para><para>	(7) The Minister must not approve a gap cover scheme unless the scheme provides for insured persons to be informed, where the circumstances make it appropriate, of any amounts that the person can reasonably be expected to pay for treatment. </para></quote><para>I understand there will be a Democrat amendment to my amendment, which I will be supporting, just to confuse the situation.

I have formally moved my amendment and that is important for the formal process. I wanted to say at the outset that we are likely to be in thunderous agreement, but there will be amendments to this amendment. The intention is to make clear that all gap cover schemes must include provisions for informed financial consent of patients. This has been a very important issue and was a very important issue in the Senate inquiry. We think this will ensure that, where the circumstances are appropriate, the patient will be told in advance what they can reasonably expect to payâa very important principle.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been a lot of discussion about exactly how this provision should be expressed. We make it clear that we think it is preferable that we provide it in writing and we have supported that view. The Democrat amendment, as I understand, will help reinforce that. We acknowledge that there are circumstances when that is not possible. At the Senate inquiry, we had a debate where I and other senators tried to tease out how we could handle this issue. It is one of those things where everyone is in favour but it is very hard to get people to move on the issue because the practicalities are difficult. We are very keen to make a move on the practicalities because one of the major complaints about health insurance and gap payments is where patients are faced with bills that they were not anticipating. This undermines confidence in health insurance and puts great stress on the patient and their families when they are having to deal with bills that they did not know were coming. We think it is reasonable that patients should be told in advance what the anticipated costs would be. It is time the profession came to terms with that and worked to make sure that, as much as possible, that occurs. This could be part of the gap cover scheme. It is an important step towards full, informed financial consent. Having formally moved our amendment No. 4, I forewarn that I am likely to vote for the Democrat amendment to that amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14670</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is an issue which the Democrats have been concerned about for a considerable period of time and, indeed, which successive governments have negotiated bit by bit in various ways, as we did recently. Information is now available in leaflet form through Medicare offices, telling people, basically, that thanks to a number of court cases, they should be provided with information in all circumstances if there is going to be an additional charge. Now we have the opportunity in this legislation to specifically require, for gap cover schemes, that information is provided to, as it reads here, `insured persons'. The amendment I will be moving is to insist that this is done in writing. I think that is the logical way to do it. After all, if one has a plumber into one's home, it is expected that we get some sort of a written quote. Indeed, virtually all professionals work on the system that you get a written estimate of what it is going to cost, so that you do not sign up for what you think is $35, only to get a $300 bill appearing in the mail. The benefits are for patients and for the private health insurance system generally. If we can get rid of the surprise $1,000-odd bills, then the reputation of private health insurance will improve. </para></talk.start><para>The second amendment we will be moving is to the end of this amendment, to make sure that the insured person does acknowledge receipt of the advice.

Obviously, if a person is unconscious or in an exceptional situation, then of course the person could not receive the information and therefore could not acknowledge it. I am wondering whether I could have any advice from the parliamentary secretary or from the mover of the motion as to precisely what is meant by `where circumstances make it appropriate'.

You can go down one of two routes. You can go down the route of the detailed regulations in which you specify every single time you think it is definitely necessary, perhaps have a list of where it is probably necessary or possibly necessary and have another list where you acknowledge, as Senator Harradine just said, when someone is unconscious. Obviously if you are being wheeled into the emergency department, you are not going to be able to know what you are likely to be charged. Indeed, the procedure could be quite complex. But there are other times when it is extremely difficult, particularly up-front at the initial consultation, to give advice on anything other than that initial consultation. This often relates to times when someone actually has to go in for a lengthy period of rehabilitation. Who knows, it might take a fortnight to get over a smashed leg or it might take three months of rehabilitation. You also have other issues where there is exploratory surgery or there are various procedures done with just an understanding that these may proceed immediately to surgery and that possibly this would be the amount. The discussions that have been going on and the eventual position takenâand this is now accepted by the AMAâis to move to the other end and to leave it open and vague, to be understood. We have some other amendments on this issue, which we can talk about later, but in this particular instance the wording of `appropriate' is where we have got to in terms of the broad understanding that it is really `if at all possible' but we do not want to start having to define `possible'. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>14672</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is important to acknowledge that, in trying to reach this compromise on an amendment that satisfies the criteria which the minister must take into account in the approval, the refinements now being proposed through these amendments enhance that and mean that the ministerâas we have done already through substantiating the inflationary issuesâmust therefore be assured by the sponsor proponent of the scheme that, wherever practical, all of these issues apply. Senator Harradine raises an issue with regard to the phrase `where the circumstances make it appropriate'. That is seen as very much the exceptional circumstance of the car accident, when there are unforeseen and inevitable consequences that cannot be met in that particular circumstance. My advice is that it is attempting to make sure that that point is well and truly covered and does not hinder the application of the appropriate medical attention at that particular point. But, certainly, the intent with regard to the gap cover is that you do have available to the minister in approving the scheme initially a commitment by the sponsors that they will accept that the proposal must be in writing and acknowledged by the patient.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hogg)</inline>âThe question is that amendments (1) and (2) moved by Senator Lees be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that amendment (4) moved by Senator Evans, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âby leaveâI move opposition amendments Nos 5 and 7 together:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(5)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (after line 22), after section 73BDE, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">73BDEA  Regulations</inline></para><quote><para>		Subject to section 73BDE, the regulations may make provision relating to the operation and regulation of gap cover schemes approved by the Minister.</para><para>(7)	Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 19) to page 6 (line 22), omit section 73BDE, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">73BDE  Review and revocation of gap cover schemes</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	Subject to regulations made for the purposes of this subsection, each registered organization must provide an annual report to the Minister and the Council in respect of any gap cover scheme that it operates.</para><para>	(2)	Regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1):</para><para>	(a)	must provide for the form and content of each report; and</para><para>	(b)	must provide for the date by which each report is to be provided to the Minister and to the Council; and</para><para>	(c)	may provide for the Minister to permit the provision of a report after the date provided for under paragraph (b) in specified circumstances; and</para><para>	(d)	may provide for the initial report in respect of a gap cover scheme to be provided in respect of a period of more or less than a year in circumstances specified in the regulations; and</para><para>	(e)	may provide for reporting on the proportion of cases in which advice about the expected costs of treatment was provided to insured persons in advance.</para><para>	(3)	Where a scheme fails to perform in accordance with:</para><para>	(a)	the requirements of paragraph 73BDD(6)(b); or</para><para>	(b)	any prescribed criteria for approval; or</para><para>	(c)	any condition imposed by the Minister;</para></quote><para>the Minister must establish a review of the operation of the scheme to determine whether it should continue to operate, or continue to operate subject to further conditions.</para><quote><para>	(4)	The Minister may revoke a scheme if:</para><para>	(a)	the Minister has established a review of the scheme under subsection (3); and </para><para>	(b)	a period of 12 months has elapsed since the review was completed; and</para><para>	(c)	the scheme has failed to rectify any faults identified by the review.</para><para>	(5)	A registered organization may seek variation or revocation of a scheme in prescribed circumstances and the Minister may:</para><para>	(a)	approve such variations subject to any additional conditions that he or she thinks necessary to achieve the objects of gap free schemes; or</para><para>	(b)	revoke the scheme.</para></quote><para>I have moved these amendments together because (5) is redundant if (7) is not carried. Basically, these amendments seek to replace some regulations which we think were inadequate in the original draft of the bill. The bill provides for annual reporting but it is vague about the procedure for revocation. This amendment will require that a review be undertaken if the annual report reveals that a scheme has failed to meet the criteria applying to the scheme in a significant way. Another unresolved issue is the extent of leniency to be provided in any one year if a fund is forced to push its premiums up by more than the inflationary amount. The Consumer Health Forum proposes that a fund should have a period to rectify problems if in one period the level of inflation is excessive.

I do not think this will enjoy as much support around the chamber, from indications I have had. This amendment seeks to extend the application of informed financial consent to all doctors. It follows on from the amendments we have just carried relating to informed financial consent in terms of the gap schemes. We think this is important, as there is an irresistible consumer pressure for improvement in the current situation where patients are frequently not properly informed of the costs they might reasonably be expected to incur. In the previous amendment this principle was incorporated as a requirement for informed financial consent to be provided as part of a gap cover scheme. For some time, the AMA has endorsed the concept of informed financial consent and has done work among its members to build support.  </para><para>As I indicated earlier, the outgoing president, Dr David Brand, told the Senate committee that he supported informed financial consent extending stepwise from the current level of 50 per cent up to 95 per cent. The opposition supports this goal and believes that informed financial consent should not only be available to those who are members of no gap schemes; it should be available to all patients and, over a period of time, all doctors should become used to providing their patients with this advice on cost up-front. The opposition supports the right of doctors to negotiate their charges directly with patients, but the patient must know what the full cost is and they should have the option of looking elsewhere if they think the fee is unreasonable. I am disappointed that the AMA does not support this particular amendment despite the efforts that have been made to express it in terms that provide the doctors involved with considerable discretion and exclude the cases where informed financial consent cannot be given in an emergency situation or for other practical reasons, as raised by Senator Harradine. I understand, as I said earlier, that this amendment may not receive the support of others in the chamber today, but I hope that the concept that is involved will be further discussed and that in the future more progress is made towards all doctors providing informed financial consent to their patients, whether or not it is related to no gap schemes or otherwise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>14674</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is the one opposition amendment that we cannot supportâthat is, relating to the disclosure of costs.

I can understand that the Constitution can be interpreted to mean that a doctor in private practice without any subsidy from anywhere can do what they like. But we are talking about medical professionals that get a very large percentage of their income, particularly if they are not working in the private hospital system, from the Commonwealth, from the public purse.

I recognise that this amendment is one that could be pursued in other legislation. We thought it was important to push the case about these issues and this provided a good opportunity to take that up. We were debating how we might make the gap cover scheme work and what role the doctors would play in that, and informed financial consent is very important as part of that. Labor do not accept the minister's argument that it is unconstitutional. We think the government would have to provide much more evidence to support their claim. It is very easy to say, `It's unconstitutional,' and then plead that one is not a lawyer. I am not a lawyer, either, but our lawyers are not convinced. So I think it is an issue worth pursuing. This debate has shown that there is a real consumer interest in pursuing this issue and the Labor opposition will continue to pursue it.</para></talk.start><para>I take the point Senator Lees makes that she does not want to hold up this bill on this particular measure. I can count, and we will be taking that into consideration.

Our view is that this constitutional defence is not as watertight as some would believe and that we do have much more room to move here than the minister indicates. I read the mood of the chamber. I also flag that this is an issue that will not go away and that the Labor opposition will be pursuing.

Public knowledge of prices is one of the most important ways to combat inflation. The ACCC urged health funds to set up their own database of specialist fees for their members to access. It expressed serious concern about a case in Western Australia where a GP wrote to 20 specialists and only one offered details of the fees charged. Many witnesses at the Senate inquiry agreed that it was the intention that agreements should be public. There was concern, particularly, that agreements between the funds and doctors might contain hidden clauses that bind doctors to behave other than in accordance with best clinical practice, for financial reasons. This bill should make this clear. The availability of the Internet makes possible what some years ago might have been seen as a complex and bureaucratic obligation to disclose. The Private Health Insurance Administration Council has a good web site on which it already displays a range of important information about health insurance. It would be a simple task to post on this site all agreements approved by the minister and thereby achieve a high degree of transparency for the new arrangements.

As Senator Evans says, there is a long history of GPs not being able to find information as to what radiology services or specialist services are going to charge their patients.

I also thank Senator Lees and Senator Evans for their cooperation in the passage of this gap cover legislation. This bill addresses the major problem facing the health insurance industry in hospital medical gaps. It will allow funds to insure for the difference between what a doctor charges and the combined health insurance benefit and the Medicare benefit. It is a no contract, voluntary approach to gap cover. Nothing in this bill will hinder the existing arrangements that allow gap cover under existing legislation. The regulations that attach to this bill have been drafted and made available for all interested parties. The schemes will not be approved by the minister, unless the health fund can demonstrate that the scheme will not have an inflationary impact. They will provide for informed financial consent so that patients will know if they will be out of pocket. There will be simplified billing if that is appropriate. There will be professional freedom for medical practitioners. There is also provision for reviews, revocation and reporting of schemes. The opportunity now exists for patients to be covered for no or known gaps through their private health insurance. I hope that doctors and funds take this opportunity for the sake of better value private health care. </para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a third time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14677</page.no><id.no>R991</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R990</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>14677</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>14677</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis tariff legislation amends the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988, the Excise Act 1901, the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the Fuel Blending (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997, the Fuel Misuse (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997 and the Fuel Sale (Penalty Surcharge) Act 1997. It will replace references to specific excise tariff items in those acts with generic descriptions. The Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act 1997 will also be amended to improve the ability of the government to prosecute those that are undertaking the practice of fuel substitution. This is done by changing the definition of `fuel' to cover a broader range of products and by removing the requirement for the ATO to show that the alleged illegally blended fuel has entered into home consumption.</para></talk.start><para>The story of this bill is a sad story of a government dropping the ball, of a government that is so badly mismanaging the affairs of the nation that Australian motorists have been put in danger, the environment has been polluted, and taxation revenues have been significantly affected. The story starts with fuel substitution rackets that involve rogue petrol stations adding toluene, which does not attract excise, to fuel. Toluene is essentially a paint solvent which, when added to fuel, reduces engine performance, can clog fuel injectors and can even lead to a total breakdown of engines. The extent of the fuel substitution rackets can be seen from the fact that 20 million tonnes of toluene were imported into this country in a period of four monthsâan amount that the paint industry itself would use in a period of 12 months.</para><para>Sadly, fuel substitution rackets have been going on for some time. In 1998, the federal government acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and announced that it was taking action to stamp out the problem. On 30 January 1998, the then minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Warren Truss, issued a statement that the government would crack down on fuel substitution rorts which avoid paying customs or excise duty. The government stated that it would be implementing strict new laws to combat the loss of revenue and that it would stamp out dangerous and illegal practices resulting from fuel substitution. Penalties of up to $50,000 were introduced and Customs officers were given the power to enter premises to audit records and test fuels using specially equipped trucks.</para><para>We in the opposition supported the government's legislation, and even went so far as to congratulate them on it. In September 1997, Ralph Willis, the then member for Gellibrand, in a debate on the fuel substitution legislation told the House:</para><quote><para>I also note that in the Budget the Government has also provided additional resources to the Customs Service to enable it to monitor the scheme, to investigate where fuel substitution is suspected and to take necessary action against offenders. That is very much supported by the Opposition in order to make sure that the scheme is effective.</para></quote><para>By the following year, it appeared that the scheme of investigating petrol stations using special fuel investigation trucks was having some success. In an answer given to a question in the House of Representatives in June 1998, then Customs Minister Truss stated: </para><quote><para>Now these concessional fuels have a chemical marker placed in them that can be detected in a simple test. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that these measures have proved to be very successful.</para></quote><para>He went on to say that the government were saving around $10 million a month from this measureâconsiderably more than the $25 million per annum they had expected to save. He offered the view that it is clear that the practice of substitution has been more widespread than previously thought. He said that $35 million worth of potential fuel fraud was under investigation. He concluded that:</para><quote><para>... this legislation is a clear demonstration that this government is tough on tax cheats, but it is also concerned about the safety and security of consumers.</para></quote><para>But following this early success, the problems began. After the last federal election, the federal government transferred customs excise functions to the Australian Taxation Office. This was part of the government's preparations for the introduction of the GST. While the Customs Service was committed to investigating fuel substitution rorts, it appears that the Australian Taxation Office was interested only in collecting excise.</para><para>Since July 1999, when the Australian Tax-ation Office took over direct management responsibility for fuel substitution, it has tested a total of 42 sites and found fuel substitution in eight of them. This is compared with the action of Customs, which reported in its 1998-99 annual report that it had carried out 551 site tests and found 52 positive instances of fuel substitution. Let me repeat that: the tax office tested a grand total of 42 sites. The Customs Service, when it was in charge, carried out 551 tests. That is a 90 per cent reduction in the level of testing. The tax commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, said:</para><quote><para>The Tax Office is not responsible for the quality of fuel, only for ensuring that the correct excise is paid. Consumer protection matters are the responsibility of the states and territories. </para></quote><para>My colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson has questioned the government rigorously on the reduction in fuel substitution investigation and in particular what has happened to the fuel investigation trucks that were supposed to carry out the investigation. The issue was first raised by Mr Kelvin Thomson, MP, in March this year, when Senator Kemp was asked a simple and direct question about where the trucks were. It took until 16 May for an answer to be provided to this questionânot through Senator Kemp but as an answer to questions put by Labor senators in the Senate inquiry into this bill. For the record, out of the initial seven trucks, only five remain. Given that only 42 investigations have been made since July 1999, we must question what the remaining five trucks have been used for. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>âSenator Kemp thought you were talking about a debt truck.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âWe know they have got the debt truck in hiding, Senator Campbell.

There is no doubt that one of the main reasons why the problem of fuel substitution has spiralled out of control is the government's lack of commitment to investigating its incidence. For the last 18 months, concerns about growing fuel substitution rackets have been raised with the government. In particular, Liberty Oil raised concerns with Customs officials, Minister Vanstone, Senator Kemp and the Australian Taxation Office that fuel substitution rackets were out of control. I will quote from Liberty Oil's letter, dated 22 June 1999, to Senator Kemp. The letter states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Despite bringing this practice by unscrupulous operators to the attention of relevant departments, for a number of reasons, one of which is the crossover of responsibility between the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Taxation Office, no effective preventative action has been taken. Given the scale of this avoidance we respectfully request your urgent attention and assistance. </para></quote><para>Liberty Oil's letter to Senator Vanstone is dated 16 June 1999 and states:</para><quote><para>I would like to bring to your attention the well-known and widespread ongoing excise avoidance practice within the oil industry that continues to flourish and which remains unhindered.</para><para>Not only is there a continuing loss of excise duty sustained, estimated to be in excess of $300 million annually, but also there is an ongoing potential health risk together with a real risk of mechanical damage to consumers' property arising from the widespread practice of mixing solvents with motor fuels. The further possibility of carcinogenic substances entering diesel and motor fuels sold to the public exists.</para><para>Despite our continuing concerns, and following meetings held with the Australian Customs Service, we remain unconvinced that the Government has the intention to or has provided the necessary resources and means to actively prevent these practices from continuing to occur and expand.</para></quote><para>These cries went unanswered for too long. What was Senator Vanstone doing? She is happy to stand in front of a drug bust. There is lots of publicity in a drug bust. But when it comes to standing in front of a petrol station, being caught substituting toluene for petrol, she is missing in actionâno pretty pictures, no press conferences, no daring night-time raids, and nothing to add a bit of colour and movement to this issue for Senator Vanstone. As we all know, Senator Vanstone is desperate to get back in cabinet. If you cannot get any publicity, there is no press conference, no head on the nightly news, and no action. At the recent Senate inquiry into this bill, Mr Mark Kevin, the Chief Executive of Liberty Oil, was asked when he had brought the issue of fuel substitution to the government's attention and what had been their response. He stated:</para><quote><para>It was not as quick as we would like. We started talking to the tax office well over 18 months ago and then we started writing to Senator Vanstone and the Assistant Treasurer Kemp. That was about April of last year. The reaction was too slow for us. We got letters back from the government saying that they were looking into it, that they were trying to do things about it. It was too slow.</para></quote><para>There are a number of questions that we need to ask the government in respect of the fuel substitution debacle. Why did the government take so long to investigate the problem? Were they asleep at the wheel? Why did the government stop investigations into fuel substitution? According to the tax commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, the investigations were ineffective. He stated:</para><quote><para>Previous attempts to deal with this through the use of special chemical markers and testing involving a fleet of trucks had, in our assessment, proved ineffective. </para></quote><para>That is a direct contradiction of Minister Truss; I have already read Minister Truss's quotes. Mr Carmody says they were ineffective and Minister Truss says they were very effective. The Australian Automobile Association has recently stated that it believes random testing by government is essential. </para><para>At the recent Senate inquiry into the bill, Liberty Oil suggested that fuel substitution rackets cost taxpayers $400 million last year in lost excise. It seems pretty clear that a thorough program of inspection and detection will not cost the government money; it will save the government money.</para><para>There are a number of other questions that we would like to see the government answer with respect to the bill. What is the government's response to the Australian Paint Manufacturers Federation, which is concerned that it is unfair that the paint industry should have to bear the administrative costs of the excise legislation? How will the government stop unscrupulous operators substituting toluene for petrol, even after they have claimed the rebate? Without an effective investigations unit, how will the government know whether or not fuel substitution is occurring? Is it appropriate for the tax office to have responsibility for fuel excise if it is not committed to investigating fuel substitution rorts? Is the tax office unable to fulfil its wide range of duties effectively because it is concentrating on the implementation of the GST? It is fairly clear that a massive rort has been going on, but the tax office has been too involved in its own Keystone Cops debaclesâtheir own maladministration of the ABN number and giving away taxpayers' legitimate details and emails breaching the privacy principles, as was enunciated by the Privacy Commissioner yesterday. The tax office is in a mess. </para><para>This is a complete and utter abrogation of the tax office's responsibilities. They say to us, `Trust us on the diesel fuel rebate. Trust us on the petrol station rebatesâwe can manage those,' when it is perfectly clear that they are incapable of doing the jobs they have now, never mind their new ones. The bottom line is this: this government said it would crack down on fuel substitution and instead it transferred the relevant customer staff to the tax office, which have no inclination to do inspections and which have dropped the ball completely. Almost three years after the government first introduced legislation to stop fuel substitution rackets, the problem still remains. This has cost Australian taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue and has resulted in increased risks of car breakdown for Australian motorists.</para><para>Whilst the opposition support this bill, we believe it is essential that investigations into fuel substitution be reinstituted. Aside from the safety issues involved, excise evasion has cost the country millions of dollars in lost excise revenues. Even with the passage of this bill, we need to ensure that fuel substitution does not occur through other avenues. The government has acknowledged that it has a responsibility on this issue. It is time it acted on its responsibilities and sorted out the tax office.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>14680</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats support the main purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, which amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995. We believe that the changes that these bills introduce will improve the health and safety of the community and improve the current excise regime for petroleum products. Dealing with tobacco first, the Democrats support the introduction of a per stick rate of tariff on lightweight tobacco products to discourage smoking of high volume lightweight cigarettes. For almost 100 years, the federal government has levied excise duty on cigarettes according to their weight. This differs from most other countries, I am advised, that levy cigarette excise on a per stick rather than a weight basis.</para></talk.start><para>The weight based excise system was examined by the 1995 Senate community affairs committee inquiry entitled <inline font-style="italic">The tobacco industry and the costs of tobacco related illness</inline>. The inquiry heard evidence that the weight based excise system enabled manufacturers to minimise excise costs by reducing the weight of each cigarette and packaging more cigarettes into larger packs. Submissions by a number of health groups argued that these types of packs encouraged smokers to smoke more cigarettes and were comparatively more attractive to price sensitive smokers, especially young people and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</para><para>I am aware that the then Department of Human Services and Health was unable to find any evidence that changing to a per stick regime would have any health benefits. Given the impost on the tobacco industry that such a change would cause, it was important to assess whether or not the change would have those health benefits. The committee recommended that the National Health and Medical Research Council review the weight based system for calculating the cigarette excise. The government accepted that recommendation and instigated a review process which was subsequently overtaken by the review of the tax system announced by the government in 1998.</para><para>As part of the government's tax review process, the Tax Consultative Task Force consulted with a range of health and medical groups on the issue of cigarette excise. A coalition of health groups provided a joint submission to the task force, which argued that changing to a per stick levy would reduce rates of smoking, particularly in key target groups with higher smoking rates. The government incorporated this into a new tax system, the ANTS package, announced in August 1998. The Democrats support the details of the excise on cigarettes outlined in the ANTS package. These include a rate of 18.872c per stick to be applied to all cigarettes with a tobacco content up to and including 0.8 gm per cigarette. An excise of $235.90 per kilogram of tobacco will be applied to all other tobacco products. The government projected that, as a result of this excise, high volume low weight cigarettes will rise in price. As a result, price sensitive smokers are expected to reduce their level of tobacco usageâa straight elasticity relationship in an economist's language.  </para><para>As decades-long advocates against smoking, the Democrats strongly support this and other measures to discourage people from smoking. Tobacco usage is the single largest cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. It kills more than 19,000 people a year in this country. This is 25 per cent more deaths in one year than from breast cancer, melanoma, diabetes, suicide, road deaths, leukaemia, cirrhosis of the liver, falls, AIDS, murder, narcotics and drowning combined.</para><para>Unfortunately, Australia still has relatively high smoking rates, with approximately 25 per cent of the population classed as regular tobacco users. Any measure that has an assessed potential to reduce this unacceptably high smoking rate should be encouraged. The Democrats would like to congratulate the government for its recent campaign targeting young smokers. I hope it will be successful in reducing the smoking uptake among Australia's youth because, if you can stop the young people smoking, of course, you improve their health for the decades of life ahead of them. I would also urge all Australian governmentsâthat is, all nine governments in this countryâto continue to focus on this important health issue through a sustained commitment to ongoing education campaigns about the serious risks of smoking.</para><para>Moving to petroleum excise, the Democrats also support the changes these bills make to petroleum excise. We believe it is important to combat the substitution of low excise petroleum products for higher excise fuel. The government has found evidence that this practice is becoming increasingly more common, and so this measure is timely to prevent it from spreading any further. It is important to be clear that the substitution of petroleum products is illegal and, in some cases, can be dangerous. The Democrats support the differential excises on petroleum products, depending upon the intended end use of the product. We were always very strong supporters of the non-leaded fuel differential. We believe there are environmental and social gains from imposing a relatively higher tariff rate on fuels intended for on-road use, such as diesel fuel and petrol. We support lower tariffs for fuel sold for non-transport uses, such as heating oils and kerosene, and the current exemptions for petroleum products sold for non-fuel use, such as solvents. It is unfortunate that the differential tariff rates have been exploited to avoid excise duty on transport fuels through the substitution or unauthorised blending of lower excise petroleum products. This has resulted in a loss of government revenue which, of course, could be used to provide much needed services such as hospitals and schools, which are always a demand on government revenue.</para><para>The practice of randomly blending or substituting fuels for on-road use can cause damage to vehicle engines, with potentially dangerous consequences. It is vital that this practice be stopped to protect consumers who unwittingly fill their cars with contaminated fuel. So it is a safety issue as well as a revenue issue. To stop that practice does not require just legislation; it requires attention to enforcement measures, and that was the focus of much of Senator Conroy's remarks. The Democrats have previously supported amendments to excise and customs legislation to address this issue. For example, we supported the 1993 reforms, which required the licensing of all premises that blend petroleum oil products, including refineries and service stations. As a result of this legislation, these businesses were also required to pay duty on the blended substances at either the diesel or the leaded petrol rate. The Democrats also supported the 1998 legislative changes, which enabled a chemical tracer to be added to fuels that attract concessional rates of excise duty. This has made it much easier for the Australian Customs Service to detect when these products are blended with, or substituted for, excisable fuelâat least, I am told that it has made it much easier.</para><para>From July 1999, responsibility for excise functions, including those related to fuel substitution matters, was transferred from Customs to the Australian Taxation Office. I am previously on record as remarking that that is a desirable move from a policy point of view, but it has to be accompanied by at least equivalent enforcement measures to those that Customs was able to employ. You cannot take on the responsibility without the obligation for enforcement. I hope that the ATO has learnt from the furore surrounding this issue that it needs to be more vigilant in monitoring and enforcing such legislation as is now before us to ensure that consumers are not put at risk from contaminated fuel and to ensure that the Commonwealth is not put at risk from the loss of revenue. </para><para>The Democrats support the additional measures proposed by these bills to further refine the tariff regime. We believe that the three main changes proposed are sensible and that they will contribute to a more robust regulatory regime. We welcome the support from the opposition for the government's measures, as indicated in their minority report to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on these bills. I also acknowledge that the opposition have expressed strong concerns about the bills, as raised in their minority report and in their remarks today, including the division of responsibility between the ATO and Customs in monitoring and investigating cases of fuel substitution, and I share the concerns of the opposition that the ATO does not yet appear to have given fuel substitution sufficient priority in terms of protecting the revenue base. I know, as one of the authors of the legislation we are dealing with, that they have been extremely busy over the past 12 months. However, the purpose of the Senate and the parliament in passing legislation is to keep them even busier as time goes by. So I would urge them to exercise as much vigilance in this area as possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14682</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are dealing with the <inline ref="R991">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 </inline>and <inline ref="R990">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline>. The first matter I want to raise in respect of the legislation is that apparently there is no cost to revenue in the legislation. I would have thought that it would be possible for the minister to make that information available. The legislation does involve some changes to the excise arrangements for certain categories of alcohol. I do not disagree with the thrust of those changes but it seems to me that there will be some additional revenue as a result of recategorisation of some areas.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to look at the history in chronological order of the matters relating to what has become known as the beer controversy. We are dealing here with excise legislation and, obviously, this has an important impact on the price of beer to consumers in this country. Firstly, I want to go back to the so-called ANTS package which purported to outline the impacts of the tax changes that the government put to the Australian people prior to the last election. In that ANTS package it was indicated that the price of beer was to go up by 1.9 per cent. Of course, you had to read that document quite carefully to identify the fact that apparently the 1.9 per cent referred to packaged beer. In the election campaign on a number of occasions the Prime Minister was questioned about the impact of a GST on the price of beer. There are, I think, two occasions when the Prime Minister was askedâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âOnly two?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âOnly two that I can find, but they were very important references to the price of beer. One was in response to Alan Jones on 14 August 1990 when the Prime Minister said, `There will be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer.' Then again, apparently, the Prime Minister was also questioned on the John Laws program in respect of this matter. The question apparently did relate to packaged beer and, again, there was reference to the 1.9 per cent increase in the price of beer.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is clear that the Prime Minister fudged his response. I use the term `fudged' in a gentle way because any reasonable member of the public listening to the responses by the Prime Minister on these two occasions would certainly have gained the impression that beer being sold by the glass in a club or pub was going to go up by 1.9 per cent. Of course, this is far from correct, as other events have shown.</para><para>Following the election it is well known that the Senate established a select committee to examine the various issues relating to the government's tax changes, particularly the GST. My colleague Senator Murray, who is in the chamber representing the Australian Democrats, was a member of that committee and we held numerous hearings around the country. One of the issues that was raised in the Brisbane hearings was the price of beer. We had before us witnessesâI think from the wine and spirits and brandy associationâand I asked them about the price of beer and what they thought the increase would be. They indicated on that occasion that they believed the price would go up by approximately seven to eight per cent for beer and wine sold by the glass. </para><para>Senator Murray was not there on that occasion and, as I recall, it was Senator Bartlett who was actually sitting next to me at that hearingâit is important, and I will come back to that at a later stage. That, I think, was our first indication that, in fact, the figure in the ANTS package and the comments of the Prime Minister were incorrect. I pursued in Treasury estimates this year this matter of the increase in the price of beer sold by the glass. I spoke to a Treasury official on that occasion, Monday, 7 February. I asked the Treasury officials about the price of beer in pubs and clubs and was told that their estimate was that it would go up by approximately seven per cent. I pursued the issue of the Prime Minister's comments about the price of beer going up by 1.9 per cent. The Treasury official, Mr Blair Comley, confirmed that the increase of 1.9 per cent was, in fact, only in relation to packaged beer and that was the reference in the ANTS package that had been referred to prior to the election. </para><para>Since that estimates hearing back on Monday, 7 February, this issue of the price of beer, the commitments given by the Prime Minister of this country and the misleading comments that the Prime Minister made on this issue have been a feature of considerable public comment. What we have here is a very good example of the Prime Minister misleading Australians about the impact of the GST. This is not the only example but I think it is a very important example that highlights the incorrect and wrong informationâthe misleading informationâthat has been given in so many areas of the GST by the Liberal and National parties and by the Prime Minister and other members of his government. So we had the admission by Treasury that the price of beer in a glass was to go up by about seven per cent. </para><para>But, of course, the story has progressed further since the admission by the Treasury officials in February this year that the price of beer would go up by about seven per cent. Sections of the brewing industry have indicated that they were very unhappy with the increase in the price of beer. So they should be, because I understand that they were given private undertakings, either by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer of this country, Mr Costelloâ`Don't raise this issue in the election campaign. We'll sort it out later on. Just trust us.'âand, of course, the commitments they gave on the quiet to get themselves through the election campaignâthe very fudged commitments that were givenâhave not been honoured by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. That is at least one of the reasons why the brewing industry is so angry with this government about the increases in the price of beer as sold by the glass. </para><para>The brewing industry, as is well known, is running a campaign to remind the Australian peopleâquite rightlyâof the comments by the Prime Minister that are on the record in respect of this issue. It is obvious that the campaign by the brewing industry has hit home with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Prime Minister tends to get very angry when his integrity is questioned, and I think this is one example of where the Prime Minister did mislead the Australian public on a very, very important issue. He has got quite agitated, of course, because of the campaign that has been started in some respects by the brewing industry. The Prime Minister has refrained generally from public comment on the matter; he has left it to the Treasurer. Again, you always know when the Treasurer has some concern about his GST package by the type of response that he makes to criticism. The response by the Treasurer has been to embark on a campaign of personal abuse of sections of the brewing industry. We have had comments about sections of the brewing industry being engaged in a money campaign and that they are foreign owned. If the Treasurer is going to make that criticism about Australian companies, it could be said that there are a lot of companies in this country that are foreign owned.  </para><para>Minister Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, has raised the issue of advertising alcohol, particularly at sporting events, and I do not believe that the timing of this is coincidental. There has been a campaign of outright intimidation by the Treasurer and the minister for health on this issue, because they are extraordinarily sensitive to the exposure of the misleading comments made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. I also notice that the Treasurer has made comments about Mr Kevan Gosper of Olympics fame being a member of the board of one of the brewing companies. What on earth that has to do with the issue, I do not know. It is just another example of the Treasurer resorting to a generalised campaign of abuse when he gets into trouble on this matter. So there has been criticism from members of the government about the brewing industry's campaign. What also concerns me about the government's approach is that it is not enough for them to spend $420-odd million of taxpayers' money promoting the GST and its aspects in this massive media campaign; through the placing of advertisements, they have also tried to restrict and indeed censor the brewing industry in its campaign. My colleague and leader, Senator Faulkner, asked a question about this matter in the Senate yesterday.</para><para>The Prime Minister has made misleading comments about the increase in the price of beer, and since then there have been some interesting developments in the price of light beer. Apparently, the GST package, whilst it requires the GST revenue to go to the states, does not deal with the issue of the payment made by the states to lower the price of light beer. The Commonwealth government is not compensating the states adequately in this area, and the price of light beer is estimated to go up by 11 per cent on 1 July as a consequence of the government's GST package. During the estimates hearings last week, I raised the issue of the price of beer with the ACCC. I believe that the ACCC should be investigating why the price of light beer is going up by more than 10 per cent. It was Professor Fels who said that 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent and that increases in respect of GST are not to go up by more than 10 per cent. So it will be interesting to see whether the ACCC pursues this issue. I will also pay a compliment to the ACCC. At least in the documentation that they have sent to the Australian electorate, they have included an estimate of the increase in the price of a glass of beer. At least they have included it, in contrast to the grossly misleading behaviour of this government in not including that in their pre-election material. I think it is generally understood in the community that the price of beer is indicated by the price of a glass of beer, not the price of a take-away package of beer.</para><para>In Treasury estimates last week, I examined figures in Budget Paper No. 1 relating to excise increases. Here is another example of the government covering up, or attempting to cover up, this issue. If you look at Table 6 on page 5-13 of Budget Paper No. 1, you can see the increase in indirect tax. It lists other exciseâbeer, spirits, tobacco productsâand shows the increase in revenue. That seems to be accurate. There is a 61.6 per cent increase in the excise from beer, going from $892 million to $1.441 billion. To be balanced, I should say that a significant part of that increase is due to the change in the taxation revenue collection methods, and it refers to that in that table. But what is misleading is found in Table 7 if you look at the excise rates applying from 1 August for beer. It is contained there, 16.15, and it shows the rate applying from 1 February 2000âobviously that date has passed. But it does not contain the rates to apply from 1 July this year and from 1 August this yearâand yet the revenue estimates are there. I asked Treasury why we do not have the precise excise rates, and they have taken it on notice. But this is another example of the government trying to hide the information.</para><para>The Labor Party is very concerned about the issues relating to the price of beer and the misleading statements made by members of this government, the Prime Minister in particular. But their actions have caught up with them. The fact that they misled the public and the brewing industry has come back to bite this government very hard. It is yet another example of the misleading information that we have received on the GST. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>14685</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking to the <inline ref="R991">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline> and the <inline ref="R990">Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000</inline>, I wish to particularly address the question of the amendments in schedule 2 that relate, in part, to the fuel substitution issue. I note with interest Senator Sherry's comments with regard to the government hitting the poor old beer drinker in the neck. However, they are not doing too much in respect of the people who are clearly breaching the law with fuel substitution. We will be supporting these bills, but the reality is that much of the action that is set out in the schedule 2 amendments and regulations that have now been introduced by the government are too little, too late. Indeed, they will not achieve too much in the future either. The bill only changes the structure of the tariffs, adding a chemical mark-up to toluene, for instance. That is okay if you are policing the practice.</para></talk.start><para>I will deal first with toluene. If you look at the issue of fuel substitution, you can see it has a long history. It has probably been around since fuels started to be sold. The Assistant Treasurer claimed that this was a new problem, one that has arisen recently. Not true: it has been around for a long time. Our authorities such as Customs and the tax office, and indeed the government, should have picked up on a lot of these things a lot earlier. The reason I am specifically focusing on the toluene issue is that toluene imports took off, in effect, from 1998. It is not as though this information was not readily available even in the public domain, because a lot of it was. In 1989 toluene imports consisted of only 394,127 litres. In 1998 it was 13.9 million litres. And it did not stop there. The substituters were well and truly into the racket here. By 1999 imports went up to 20.9 million litres. For January alone this year, January 2000, it was 6.5 million litres. Yet it did not dawn on poor old Customs, those people who are charged with the responsibility of at least keeping track of things that come across our borders, that everything might not be kosher. Perhaps a whole range of people had gone into the painting industry or something, because, although toluene does go into the make-up of petrol, it is used principally, as I understand it, in the painting industry. Senator Kemp would be fully aware of that because he has been part of the process.

You have got two hopes of prosecuting anybody: Buckley's and none.</para><para>The Assistant Treasurer is back. He said it was a new problem. We know that many in the fuel industry, and particularly those in the independent sections of the fuel industry, have written to the government. Liberty Oil and I think Apco wrote to the government as early as June 1999, but what happened about this? The imports of toluene sailed on. The government could simply have rung up to check out a few things with regard to toluene. If you go from June through to December and look at the overall imports of toluene, millions of litres continued to come in and went into fuel substitution rackets. Nothing was done about thatânot one thing. Even right through to January 2000, when 6Â½ million litres came in in one month, still nothing had been done.</para><para>This was a very serious problem, and this government said back in 1997 and 1998 that it had introduced measures to combat fuel substitutionâbig fines, big search powers, et ceteraâyet we allow this to continue, even with letters from within the industry itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>âWhere was the Transport Workers Union?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âFor the benefit of Senator Lightfoot, we know and the government ought to know that Shell, one of the refining companies here in Australia, used to refine nearly all the domestic requirement for toluene in this country.

As recently as six or eight weeks ago, when we were conducting an investigation into a bill referred to the Senate, we heard further evidence about fuel substitution involving naphtha. It would seem that the government authorities responsible for the monitoring, checking and prosecution of such activities are still not up to the game and are still not pursuing these matters as they should. It is all well and good for governments to make claims that they are doing things. If you are to do that, then you ought to be providing the wherewithal for the authorities responsible to do it. That is the problem, I think. There is an inability on the part of the tax officeâwho I assume now have the principal responsibility for these thingsâto get on and do the job. </para><para>It was interesting to listen to the evidence from Liberty Oil saying that they are so frustrated by this problem.

It is a serious enough problem in itself that that is occurring. That should, of itself, jolt any government into action, to actually get on and do something about this. But oh no, we were still plodding along with this argument from Customs and from the Australian Taxation Office. In my view, they did not have the capacity to deal with the issues; that is, they simply did not have the resources to get on and do the job.

Minister Truss, in 1998, seemed to think that that was going to fix the problem, but obviously did not tell the tax office. He did not convey the message to the tax office that we want enforcement, that we actually want these things checked out. </para><para>At the outset, I think Senator Sherry was talking about the price of beer. It is interesting that the poor old punters who drink beer can pay more, but we can do little to deal with what is a very serious issue. I know we are proposing to pass legislationâa step in the right directionâbut there is nothing to back it up. It is all well and good to have excises applicable to various fuels, but if you have nothing to back it up, if you have no mechanism in place to run checks and to find out whether substitution is actually occurring, it is a glaring example of the past where Customs have cleared imports but somehow did not switch on. The bell did not ring for them when, during 1998, 1999 and early 2000, the huge increase in toluene imports could have meant something in terms of a fuel substitution problem.</para><para>I was staggered by their evidence to the committee when they said, `It's not really something we look at.' I find that sort of approach amazing. I would hope that the government will address themselves to that and will get Customs inâthe Assistant Treasurer can probably convey this to the minister responsible for Customsâor the tax office, and pass it down the line that they should look for signs when they occur. They should play a watchdog role here. Fuel substitution has been around a long time.</para><para>I have asked Customs and the tax office if they have a list of potential fuel substitutes. I understand from their response that they do. So when we get these imports coming in, I do not see why there would be a problem with them being a bit more forthright in terms of making an assessment of what the end use for the product might be and asking a few questions. They should play a bit of a detective role here. That would be even a half-baked responsible approach to take.</para><para>I hope that, as a result of these changes and with the introduction of this legislation, the Assistant Treasurer and the minister for customs will get on the job. I know the Assistant Treasurer is certainly capable of doing thisâof getting on and getting the job done.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âThis speech is improving.

The first change implements the ANTS proposal to move to a per stick rate of excise and customs duty on most cigarettes, lightweight cigars, bidis and other lightweight products marketed in the stick form. The change removes the taxation advantage, which had skewed consumption towards higher volume, lightweight cigarettes, which experts considered to be more harmful on health grounds. The amendments also insert a definition of tobacco in the schedule to the excise tariff. This will clarify when tobacco leaf becomes excisable to assist in addressing illicit production. Similar provisions apply to imported leaf. These changes for tobacco have effect from 1 November 1999. </para><para>The changes for petroleum have effect from 15 November 1999. These changes are part of a systemic solution to petroleum excise evasions occurring through fuel substitution. They are designed to restrict access to concessionally taxed and duty free products for those who can demonstrate a clear and legitimate need for these products. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee considered these measures contained in the bills to be important for countering fuel substitution activities and recommended that the Senate pass the bills. A range of issues were raised in the second reading debate, all of which have been answered extensively either before the Senate committee or in the debate in the lower house. Given the quality of some of those assertions which were made relentlessly but were always rejected, I do not propose to delay the Senate or the second reading.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14688</page.no><id.no>R1001</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>14688</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14688</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1001">Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>. This bill amends the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979 and the ASIO Act 1979 to, amongst other purposes, enable the Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales to have access to intercepted material for the purposes of the Inspector's statutory functions, to provide for interception warrants against a named person and to provide for warrants covering foreign communications. The amendments respond in part to a practical operational difficulty arising out of essentially rapid change in the telecommunications industry. In part, they respond to the telecommunications interception policy review which was tabled in the parliament on 25 August 1999. I am informed that many of the amendments effect technical changes to the act to improve the operation of the act in view of the practical experience of law enforcement and security agencies. </para></talk.start><para>At the outset I note that it is the view of our shadow Attorney-General, Rob McClelland, that this act seeks to balance two very important objectives: (1) providing our law enforcement and security agencies with appropriate powers to carry out their functionsâfunctions to improve the safety of the community and the Australian nation; and (2) ensuring that the rights of Australian citizens are adequately safeguarded in the process of approving warrants for telecommunications interception. These are the two considerations that quite often riddle debates in this area. They have been the considerations that have been quite important over the years as parliaments have tried to work out the balance between them and to ensure that, for instance, issues of national security are taken into account but at the same time measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection of Australian citizens.  </para><para>It is interesting to note that a Senate committee was charged with looking at this legislation. There have also been other comments made with respect to the legislation. Those same matters were raised at the Senate committee, and the view of the committee was that the changes as proposed could be accepted. It is also interesting to note that there were not all that many submissions put to that committee from people concerned about the issue of whether the balance was not struck in this legislation. That is something that in a sense may be unprecedented, given the history of this legislation over the years. </para><para>The opposition's view is that law enforcement agencies must be provided with powers to intercept telecommunications for proper law enforcement purposes. However, our view also is that Australians are entitled to the reassurance that there are appropriate limits on the availability of warrants for these purposes. This legislation, as I said, was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for examination and report. That committee considered the need for new warrants, the adequacy of safeguards and the adequacy of reporting mechanisms. I shall refer to that committee's recommendations further down the track.</para><para>I turn to some of the key amendments, particularly to the amendments with respect to the Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales. The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill will enable that Inspectorâwhich is a New South Wales government statutory entity, separate from the Police Integrity Commissionâto receive intercepted information collected by other agencies and to use that information in the performance of its statutory functions. The commission itself obtained intercepting powers after the amendments to the interception act in 1997. It is the view of the opposition that these amendments do not confer any additional authority on the Inspector or the Police Integrity Commission to undertake interceptions of its own volition.</para><para>Turning to warrants, I note that the interception act was framed some 20 years ago. It is the view of the opposition that in those days everyone used a fixed-line telephone based on an analog technology provided by Telecom. Interception was, in a sense, a very simple matter. The interception act is structured around the premise of a warrant authorising the interception of a single, identified telephone service. Rapid advances in technology mean that customers may now choose from a variety of services and means of communications rather than a fixed single phone line. For example, a person may subscribe to multiple services by acquiring several prepaid mobile phone cards for use in one telephone handset, and these cards can be swapped around and discarded at will. The interception act in its present form would require an agency wishing to intercept all of the telecom services used by a particular suspect to obtain a separate warrant for each service. This bill will update the principal act to enable connections, disconnections and reconnections, in rapid succession, of interceptions of multiple services without the need to obtain a fresh warrant each time. Those multiple services, of course, would be used by a particular suspect in connection with the same matter. </para><para>The criminals and those persons who may pose a threat to Australian security are quick to pick up new technologies with the express intention of evading investigation. Modern technology can be used to disguise the identity of users. The current legislation, which requires the individual service and each individual subscriber to be identified before a warrant can be issued, is rapidly losing its effectiveness in the modern telecom environment. Schedule 2 of the bill will amend the interception act to enable interceptions of multiple services used by a particular suspect in connection with the same offence without the need to obtain a fresh warrant each time. The schedule will provide for the interception of foreign communications and there will be three categories of warrant. The first category is that of telecommunications service warrant. These warrants are already available under existing provisions of the intercept act and they will continue unchanged. </para><para>The next category is that of a named person warrant. This is a new category of warrant designed to overcome the problems presented by suspects using multiple services. The NCA told the Senate committee which inquired into the need for these warrants that investigations undertaken by 19 law enforcement agencies participating in the Blade National Task Force, the task force which coordinated a national effort against South-East Asian organised crime, noted an increase in use of multiple SIM cards, quite often used under false identities, and multiple mobile phone handsets amongst people involved in heroin trafficking. Persons under investigation freely switched mobile phone SIM cards using an array of phone and SIM card combinations. That is a concern that needs to be factored into the legislation formulation process. This category of warrant will authorise the agency to intercept any fixed or mobile service, telephone line, pager, et cetera used or likely to be used by the person named on the warrant. It is only available if the telecom service warrant would be ineffective in the circumstances. Any agency which aims to obtain a named person warrant must first demonstrate that a regular telecom service warrant is not adequate. The agency must still identify each particular service the named person is using or is likely to use and must notify the carrier concerned in writing before the service may be intercepted.</para><para>The existing procedures and criteria for the issue of a warrant and the record keeping and reporting requirements of the interception act will apply in full to a named person warrant. Those procedures relating to accountability, as we have shown in the debate in previous days, aim to protect the abuse of the issue of warrants and to protect privacy so far as is consistent with the legal use of interceptions. However, we note that there will be an extra requirement in this legislation: that is, the judge or members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal before issuing a named person warrant must first be satisfied that other methods of investigation, including less intrusive telecom service warrants, have been considered and are either unavailable or ineffective in the circumstances. There will also be additional reporting requirements. After the expiry of a named person warrant, the agency to which the warrant was issued will be required to report to the minister specified information about the warrant, the interceptions conducted under its authority, including a list of the services intercepted under the warrant and the reasons why it was ineffective to use a telecom service warrant.</para><para>Under the principal act, the accountability provisions are expressed to apply to Commonwealth agencies only, but section 35 provides that similar reporting will apply to a state or Northern Territory agency declared under section 34 to be able to apply for a warrant to intercept telecommunications. The responsible state minister to whom the initial reporting must be made is also required to report to the Commonwealth minister responsible for the administration of the principal act, the Attorney-General. A number of other accountability measures for Commonwealth bodies are specified in the legislation. Agencies are to keep records of warrants issued and details of warrants issued to bodies other than ASIO are to be kept on a general register maintained by the Commissioner of the AFP. The general register is to be submitted to the minister every three months. Similar requirements apply in relation to warrants that have ceased to be in force and did not lead to criminal proceedings being or likely to be commenced. The A-G must be provided with copies of warrants issued to a Commonwealth or state authority and copies of instruments revoking the warrants or warrant. This information must be provided as soon as practicable after the issue or revocation of a warrant. Where a warrant is issued or revoked, details of the usage of the warrant and to whom information gained from the warrant has been communicated, any arrests that have been made or are likely to be made because of the information gained from the warrant and the usefulness of the information obtained must be provided within three months of the issue or the revocation of the warrant. A telecom carrier must give to the minister within three months of a warrant ceasing to be in force details of the action taken by the carrier. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has the power to check the records of Commonwealth agencies to ensure that the above requirements are complied with. State agencies may only be authorised to apply for a warrant if their establishing law provides for an independent body to scrutinise the agency's records. All these measures are in place in respect of this particular category of warrant. Those measures, as I indicated earlier, are there to try and give some balance in the interest of protecting the privacy of individuals. </para><para>The third category of warrant is the foreign intelligence warrant. A foreign intelligence warrant will enable interception of particular communications which cannot be identified by reference to specific services or named individuals. I note there is a bit of debate about the broadness of the legislation in this respect.</para><para>Moving on to the Senate committee report, on 11 May 2000 the Senate committee handed down its report on the bill. The committee made three recommendations: firstly, that the bill provide for a review of its operations within three years of it coming into effect; secondly, that a note be inserted in the bill to make it quite clear that the proposed section 75A, the section which deals with the way in which evidence obtained under warrant is given, is subject to the general rules of admissibility; and, thirdly, that the bill proceed without amendment. In response to the committee's report, the government has advised that it will commit to conducting the review within three years of the legislation coming into effect in accordance with the recommendation. We on this side of the parliament welcome that commitment. In response to recommendation 2, the government has advised that section 78 of the interception bill provides:</para><quote><para>Nothing in Part 2A or in this Part renders information, or a restricted record, admissible in evidence in a proceeding to a greater extent than it would have been admissible in evidence in that proceeding if this Part had not been enacted.</para></quote><para>It is the view of the shadow attorney that, as new section 75A falls within part 2A, it is considered that section 78 achieves the purposes of the committee recommendation 2. Accordingly, it is our view that it is not necessary to amend the bill. In summary, the opposition appreciates the change of circumstances that has given rise to most of these amendments to the telecom interception regime now in place, and we support the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14691</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too rise to express support for this legislation. The <inline ref="R1001">Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> deals with a very important matter concerning law enforcement and the process of law enforcement, and equally important matters of privacy and the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. At its essence, telecommunications interception has become very necessary because of the criminal activity that has become more technically proficient than ever before. I noted that proponents in one of the submissions to the inquiry spoke particularly about the useâor as they would refer to it the `abuse'âof so-called SIM cards and silicon technology in today's mobile phones where it is so very easy simply to not only have a number of mobile phones and exchange them but also exchange the SIM cards within them. These cards can be purchased anonymously, making it very difficult for law enforcement agencies. But I suspect that is a sign of things to come in terms of the dramatically evolving pace of information technology in today's society.</para></talk.start><para>I will not take too much of the Senate's time, but I would like to briefly add some comments to what I have already said. I want to pick up on the last time that the Senate considered telecommunications interception legislation. My colleague and then Democrats spokesperson for law and justice, Senator Andrew Murray, made the following observations:  </para><quote><para>Clearly, the area of law enforcement which has the greatest demand for telecommunications interception warrants is drug law enforcement and I expect it will continue to be so. Villains do not have concern for civil liberties, nor do they care much for issues of privacy, the rule of law, or for that matter, the value of human life.</para><para>Indeed, the Australian Democrats have been at the forefront of the debate in trying to seek a rational, enlightened approach to the issue of heroin addiction, such as the now scuttled, but soon to be revived ACT heroin trial. The government does not have the answers, we do not think Labor has the answers and we doubt that we have the answers. But we certainly do believe that we should continue to explore methods of finding the answers.</para><para>The response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the ACT heroin trial is the classic reactionary position of putting your head in the sand. It stands as a testament to the lack of any attempt to find new solutions to this problem.</para></quote><para>Clearly, he was referring to a specific issue at the timeâbut the premise is clear. I would concur with those comments, but I would also add that the myopia experienced by the government concerning harm minimisation in a general sense is really quite distressing. Prohibition does not work. It never has worked and, while we continue as a nation to ignore the harm and suffering of those who are chemically dependent, we are by omission contributing to that suffering.</para><para>I will turn now to the matter of civilian oversight of its Australian police forces. In my comments, I am indebted to the Australian Institute of Criminology <inline font-style="italic">Trends and Issues</inline> paper. The Roman satirist, Juvenalis, rhetorically once asked: `Who will guard the guardians.' That in part is one of the issues that we are really dealing with here tonightâhow do we keep an eye on those powers in our society that have power themselves. Historically, countries like Australia have largely preferred to trust policeâand in that I include ASIOâto keep their own houses in order, with minimal guardianship administered by the courts and governments. That minimal approach was, in quite simple terms, found wanting. Numerous inquiries have demonstrated the vulnerability of policing and police officers to corruption and misconduct. Whilst it must be stated that a large number of officers in our forces are untouched by corruption, when incidents of corruption are exposed they bring into disrepute the entire administration of the criminal justice system.</para><para>There can be no doubt that constant vigilance and strong measures are required to prevent maladministration and misbehaviour becoming widespread and entrenched in policing organisations. The issue is no longer one of whether or not the guards need guarding, but that of determining the best form of guardianship. A diverse range of systems has emerged in recent years with competing claims for effectiveness. I, for one, believe we are fortunate to have a quality Australian Federal Police service, and I commend them for their continuing professionalism in that regard. At essence here is ongoing concern that has been articulated by the Australian Democrats over many years in terms of the protection of the rights and the civil liberties of the citizensâwhen we, as a parliament, extend powers to policing authorities, what protections are there for the citizens such as they are not subject to civil liberty abuse.</para><para>Having read through the submissions to this inquiry and having looked at the correspondence between the various offices, including the Attorney-General's office, I am confidentâconvinced, in factâthat those protections are there and that there is no particular extension on this occasion as to the involvement that policing services may have in terms of how and why they might go about interception possibilities. It is clear from the act and also through correspondence from the Attorney-General that those gatekeeping procedures are there to protect citizens and can and will be accessed by those people who want to make an interception application order.</para><para>I am also confident that the structure of the reporting procedures is such that citizens can have faith in the system. I note that, through the inquiry process, it was suggested that there ought to be a third year review after the implementation of this legislation. I would support that. I am given to understand that amendments to that effect will not be moved, but that the minister may be indicating that in her second reading speech. I am confident in regard to the protections in the bill. It is clear that, under the principal act, warrants can be obtained for two purposes: firstly, national security; and, secondly, law enforcement. The Attorney-General may issue warrants for the interception of telecommunications where the subject of the warrant is reasonably suspected of engaging in activities prejudicial to security. I think that is fair and reasonable. An application for such a warrant is made to the Attorney-General by ASIO's director general of security, and in certain circumstances the Director General may issue a warrant for a limited period if, for example, waiting for a response from the Attorney-General would be prejudicial to national security. </para><para>I am also confident in the structure of the bill in terms of law enforcement agencies that can apply for interception warrants. This is also prescribed in the principal act, and the warrants are confined to the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. The act also provides for eligible authorities such as the New South Wales Crime Commission, the NSW royal commission into police corruption, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, and the Anti-Corruption Commission in my home stateâbodies of reasonable integrityâwhich might have need or cause to access information but cannot initiate an interception procedure themselves.</para><para>Without recapping what Senator Bolkus has already said, the Democrats are pleased to support this legislation. We see it as necessary with today's evolving, modern information technology. I make the point that there seems to be a catch-up, if I could call it that, in terms of the parliament feeling the need to respond to the evolution that is taking place with regard to information technology, and we have seen this played out across politics and within different pieces of legislation. I am thinking in particular of moves by the parliament to impose what is perceived to be Internet censorship in a way that, I would argue, and have argued for some years, is like trying to catch smoke with your hands. It cannot, in any real sense, be done.</para><para>Politicians are light-years behind where today's information technology is at, and Internet censorship is a case in point. Particular Australian sites which are banned or to which access is refusedâbecause they are considered offensive by self-appointed moral guardiansâcan be accessed simply by going around them to sites from other countries which may be providing that material on the Internet. Simply by removing the suffix `au' on an Internet address and replacing it with another country's suffix, you can, in a matter of seconds, get to a site elsewhere.</para><para>I also refer to the crackdown on phone sex mechanisms which has occurred in this place and in the House of Representatives. It will soon be pretty much impossible to access those phone sex chat lines which 1.5 million Australians per month enjoyed. However, anybody who wants to access such a service can do so simply by phoning overseas. I think this is yet another example of politicians' response to the reality of today's world and the changing nature of information technology. </para><para>This brings me back to the earlier point I made about the use of SIM cards in mobile phones. With the advent of mobile phone technology, I wonderâas this legislation aims to target the person rather than a fixed line of telecommunications in terms of a telephoneâabout the extent to which interception can be carried out. I wonder, for example, how easy it is going to be to trace a particular person who is changing mobile phones and/or SIM cards. I think we should also acknowledge that, within the next two, four or six years, we are going to have even more extraordinary developments in information technology. I do not know what will follow on from the SIM card, but I am sure something is in the pipeline. It may not be all that long before there is a form of information technology through the use of mobile phones or some other communication device which cannot, whether we like it or not, be followed.  </para><para>Given that it does not seem unreasonable at this point in time, I am confident that the civil libertarian protections in this legislation are there for the citizens and that the reporting procedures for services accessing these devices are also adequate. I do support the notion that there should be a review after three years, and I understand the minister will speak to that. Having said all that, I support the legislation, and the Australian Democrats will be voting for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>14694</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Bolkus and Senator Greig have both set forward principles which we all agree with and, as a result of the approach that the parties have taken to this matter, the bill is going to be passed into law. However, I think some of the principles which Senator Bolkus and Senator Greig have raised need to be reiterated in the present context.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1001">Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The central provision in the act is section 7, which is headed `Telecommunications not to be intercepted'. Subsection (1) reads:</para><quote><para>A person shall not:</para><para>(a) intercept;</para><para>(b) authorize, suffer or permit another person to intercept; or</para><para>(c) do any act or thing that will enable him or another person to intercept;</para><para>a communication passing over a telecommunications system.</para></quote><para>So the central feature of this act is that it preserves the integrity of communications passing over electronic equipment. The act makes exceptions in certain circumstances, but the exceptions should be limited and hopefully will remain limited into the futureâalthough there is a tendency for legislative creep in this act and more and more people get the right to use telecommunications that have been intercepted under this act. The principle to remember is that we should preserve the integrity of phone callsâand I show my age when I use that expressionâor any conversation. No matter what the communication, we live in a decent, proper and humane society, and we ought to be able to communicate free from spying. </para><para>It is the sort of thing that Sir Winston Churchill was talking about in 1938. Unfortunately, I can remember Sir Winston Churchill, certainly during the war. In 1938 he made a broadcast to the United States of America. He was then a backbencher, and the great glory that was to be his seemed to be distant, but he did make this radio broadcast to the United States on 16 October 1938. He talked about the sort of society the Nazis were creating in Germanyâthis was before the war. He was concerned about the culture and the climate that reigned in the society that then pertained to Germany. The great man described it as a state of society where men may not speak their minds, where children denounce their parents to the police, where businessmen or small shopkeepers ruin a competitor by telling tales about his private opinion. Sir Winston was talking about conversations between people being made available to the police, and the wrong that could arise from that unless the police were people of integrityâwhich the police in Australia are, particularly the Australian Federal Police. That creates the background as to why we have an act and why it is proper for us as parliamentarians to make statements such as this when the integrity of those communications is being modified.</para><para>We have talked tonight about how technology creates an environment such that changes have to be made to the law. But the principle of keeping communications safe and protected has always been there in societies that developed from the English common law system. In that context, I would like to quote from a court case, Pearse v. Pearse, that took place back in 1846âwell over 150 years ago. The case was decided by the Vice-Chancellor. People had said, `We ought to have this material available. The more truth we have available to us the better.' This was in the context of communications between a client and a solicitor. I think it is very pertinent to what we are talking about tonight, the Vice-Chancellor said:</para><quote><para>Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwiselyâmay be pursued too keenlyâmay cost too much. And surely the meanness and mischief of prying into a man's confidential consultations with his legal adviser, the general evil of infusing reserve and dissimulation, uneasiness, and suspicion and fear, into those communications which must take place, and which, unless in a condition of perfect security, must take place uselessly or worse, are too great a price to pay for truth itself. </para></quote><para>This was in a time before phones were invented, so the judge was talking about communications by letter and conversation. Since then, telephones have come about, and communications have developed to a very sophisticated extent indeedâto the extent that the law needs to be modified by the present bill. But the general principle that the judge was talking aboutâthe principle that we ought to be able to talk to people free of other people's pryingâremains. If we in Parliament House, or indeed anywhere, want to speak to our wives or to our partners; or if we are in the professions, to our clients; or if we are in business, to our customers; or just to our friends, to our coach or, indeed, to our lovers, shouldn't we be able to do so without people prying?</para><para>In a certain sense there is no logic to underpin that. That is a principle that comes from our visceral feelings as human beings. As human beings, there should be some cases whereby we can go forward and talk to people; indeed, in the case of confession we should be able to speak to our clergy, confident in their keeping our revelations safe and sound. The point I want to make is this: when we withdraw the integrity of communications to any extent, as we have in the Telecommunications Act and which we will do when we pass this bill tonight, we should do that only in the most serious of circumstances and with the understanding of what we are doing. It would be very bad if we developed a cultureâif we developed a custom in the communityâwhere we said, `If you want to listen to what Senator Hogg, Senator Ludwig, Senator Greig or Senator Alston said, that's all right.' It would be very bad if we got to that, and that is why it is very important that we as a parliament say, `Yes, we will give these powers but we give these powers reluctantly because we know it is part of human life, part of the decent way we live, that this should not happen.' One of the worst things that criminals do to us is to lead us to make these laws. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, we have to get to the point where we have to make this judgment as to what should and should not happen. Nevertheless, that is how life is and that is what happens.</para><para>In this context I will set out some principles that are contained in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills fourth report of 2000, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation</inline>. I declare an interest in this; I am chairman of the committee. I think it would be good if everybody read the profound words that are contained in this document. It deals with the issue of powers of entry and search, but it also sets out principles that I think are very pertinent to this present debate. The first one set out is this:</para><quote><para>Â·	people have a fundamental right to their dignity, to their privacy, to the integrity of their person, to their reputation, to the security of their residence and any other premises, and to respect as a member of a civil society;</para></quote><para>Of course, what should also have been put in there is: `and to the integrity of their communications with other people.' Perhaps we will take it back and rewrite it. The second dot point says:</para><quote><para>Â·	no person, group or body should intrude on these rights without good cause;</para></quote><para>And it is that good cause that we are arguing about now. It is agreed by the parliament that the good causesâand I will come to those in a minuteâset out in this bill satisfy the tests that are propounded here. The third dot point states:</para><quote><para>Â·	Such intrusion is warranted only in specific circumstances where the public interest is objectively served and, even where warranted, no intrusion should take place without due process;</para></quote><para>The due process idea has been a long time in development. I think it is a worthy one. It is set out and relied on strongly in the American Constitution. I think there are due process clauses in constitutions more and more in the English speaking world. America has one in the constitution which underpins its present system of government. New Zealand has one; it is a legislated one. Canada and England each have one. We have been through this before. I will just digress a while. I think it is very important to point out that all nations comparable to ours have a bill of rights, and we have not. I think it is time we got one. I do not think it will happen readily but, nevertheless, it should, because what it does is set out certain fundamental rights which, unless they are defined and overarching, are likely to be attacked by legislative creep. </para><para>It is easy to say that we should have integrity of communications and that we are going to make sure that the integrity of communications is preserved. We are told that, in the particular circumstances that pertain at the moment, the Police Integrity Commission of New South Wales wants access to the information obtained through telephone tapping. It is easy enough if you have a bill of rights to ask, `Does that commission satisfy the test?' But it is a lot harder when you do not have a bill of rights to say, `We haven't got a bill of rights and we can't think of any overriding principle that is expressed in law that would stop the Police Integrity Commission having it and, therefore, we will give it to the commission.' In other words, it is easier for legislative creep to occur where there is no bill of rights. If there were a bill of rights we would say, `There are all these good reasons why this particular body or person should have the right to tap your telephone but, nevertheless, there is this overriding principle that it or he or she must comply with to stop this happening.' If you have the overriding principle, it is much more difficult to allow the legislative creep to occur.</para><para>I think that is well set out in a paper from the Information Research Services of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. As a parliament I do not think we give enough acknowledgment to the Parliamentary Library for the great research that is done there. I know I have not done it enough. I would like to quote from this document because I think it sets out the situation well. I think we ought to acknowledge that it was written on 31 May 2000 by Jennifer Norberry, Law and Bills Digest Group. In talking about the background to the <inline ref="R1001">Telecommunications (Interception) Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>, I think she sums up very well what happens with legislative creep. She says:</para><quote><para>Prior to the commencement of the <inline font-style="italic">Telephonic Communications Act 1960</inline> (Cwlth) there were no statutory prohibitions on telephone interception in Australia. The 1960 Act prohibited telephone interception except in very limited circumstances. Interceptions could only be carried out for national security reasons or by the Postmaster-General's Departmentâ</para></quote><para>there was such a department at one stageâ</para><quote><para>for technical purposes or to trace unlawful calls (eg nuisance calls). Interception for general law enforcement purposes was not permitted. The use of telephone intercepts for general law enforcement purposes `lacked a secure legal basis until the enactment of the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979</inline>'1 (the Principal Act).</para></quote><para>And so it goes on. There has been a big change since then. I notice that Mr Holland is in the advisers box. He would know this better than anyone because he was very close to it in the 1980s and 1990s, and he still is very close, with a profound mind, may I say.</para><para>What has happened for all the very best of reasons is that more and more people have gained access to telephone taps since 1979. I think we have grown used to it and, as people before me have said, the extension of the power to intercept phones is justified in this case and accordingly it will happen. As pointed out by people who came before us in the Senate committee, the technology is such that it is not nearly as useful now to try to get a particular telephone service tapped. You have to get all the services that a particular person uses, or might use, and tap those to get intelligence and evidence.</para><para>One thing I should sayâand it happened in a previous inquiry that we were doing on the telephone tapâis that we should keep in mind that the police say this is a good safe means of investigation. In other words, if you are tapping a telephone you are not likely to be shot or assaulted by somebody who suddenly comes upon you. I think that is a big factor. I have talked about the rights of citizens and of enforcement officers and, of course, those rights are profoundly important. I think that is a factor in favour of allowing an extension here, knowing that people are able to be properly authorised and to get information in less dangerous situations than would otherwise be the situation.  </para><para>We agree to the legislation but we say that every time it is amendedâand it will be amended again and again in the futureâspeeches like this ought to take place. This is the only way to keep in mind the fact that we want to live in a society that is free and where we can communicate reasonably and with confidence.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>14697</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI congratulate Senator Cooney for that speech and particularly for his concern that there is a tendency for legislative creep in this act and his concern that we have to be very vigilant about legislation like this, which is the reason I do not support it.

In fact, I am very concerned that this legislation gives some legitimacy to this process of comprehensive spying which is not confined to Australia or the United Statesâit is carried on around the world. I believe that citizens should know about it and be aware of the enormous potential damage that can accrue from it, and tomorrow I will give the Senate some specific cases where this form of intelligence has been abused in the political arena, in the economic arena and used against the interests of ordinary citizens speaking on mobile phones in the street. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>14697</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Hogg)</inline>âIt being 6.50 p.m., the Senate will move to consideration of government documents.</para></talk.start></interjection><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Forest Agreement: Gippsland</title><page.no>14697</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>14697</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>Firstly, it is pleasing to see that we have today in the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> three of the remaining RFAsâRegional Forest Agreementsâthat have been negotiated between the respective states and the Commonwealth.

Fortunately there are a couple more to come. </para><para>The record of this government in respect of promoting and bringing about a resolution of the Regional Forest Agreement process is a very shabby one. That is not unusual because the minister responsible for forestry issues in this government is, of course, Mr Wilson Tuckey who, since he assumed the portfolio from the previous hapless minister, Mr Anderson, has simply treated the issue of forests as a political football to be kicked at his whim. </para><para>We have seen, during the period of time that Mr Tuckey has been the minister, a situation where agreements have been negotiated and then disowned by the Commonwealth government or, in the case of Western Australia, by the state government. In fact, it has got to a point where the states really do not have any confidence in Mr Tuckey at all and they have really gone about negotiating the remaining regional forest agreements in spite of Mr Tuckey. Fortunately, they have been able to do that because they have been prepared to apply themselves to bringing about agreements between industry and the conservation movement to, first of all, protect, where appropriate, native forest estates and, secondly, to provide resource security to the industry both in terms of timber from native forests and in promoting plantation forests for the future. This agreement, the Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement, is one of those. Mr Tuckey, just after the budget was announced on 9 May, put out a portfolio summary media release which he headed `Forestry under the Coalitionâ1996-2000'. In that document he attempted to set out what he believed were the achievements of his government and he claimed that during the period of the Labor government we had done nothing. For instance, he made the claim that we had not signed any RFAs whilst we were in government. Of course, we all recall that it was the Labor Party, when it was in government prior to 1996, that developed the regional forest agreements process.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âThen you voted against it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âIt was the Labor Party in government actually that finally took action to remove the annual political bunfight that used to go on in the industry.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âAnd then you wouldn't support us.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âIt was the Labor government that established a process to bring the various stakeholders together to sit down and scientifically examine the resources in this industry, to examine the environmental considerations and to promote regional forest agreements.

Mr Tuckey criticises us and Senator McGauran again shoots his mouth off, but the government were elected in March 1996 and if, as they claim, they were so good, and if they want to criticise us because they said we did not get any RFAs negotiated while we were in office, why did it then take them another 12 months to sign the first RFA? It was not until February 1997, 12 months after they got into office, that they were able to sign the first RFA.

It is proceeding, of course, at the greatest rate in history but we have now had it overtaken by the Howard government, which has a reprehensible environmental record around the world. </para></talk.start><para>Just two weeks ago I delivered to the German government pictures of the firebombing and destruction of Tasmania's forests, which goes on while this government is off to the next round of meetings on global warming, pretending it does not occur, discounting it but wanting to count the seedlings that it puts in the ground as an offset to industrial pollution. It is that sort of studied ignorance and deception which the Greens will never allow to go not commented upon. In commenting on this particular agreement between the logging industry and the other logging industryâthat is, the Victorian government, the Bracks government, and the Howard government, and what unholy bedfellows they make when it comes to the destruction of forestsâthat $333 million of taxpayers' money has gone into propping up the logging industry through the regional forest agreement process. But, as far as the production of jobs is concerned, that has not happened. In the case of the Tasmanian agreement, since it was signed in 1998, instead of jobs being secured, some 800 people have been sacked from the industry. There has not been a comment by the Tasmanian Labor government or any process of redressing that, nor will there be anything similar from the Labor government in Victoria. They are co-villains in signing these regional forest agreementsâagainst the wishes of 80 per cent of people in all the opinion pollsâwith the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Howard, for the continued onslaught on native forests in places like East Gippsland.

People on both sides of the house rip into me about this because they do not like the facts being placed before them. They will twist it, but here is a fact: there is a plantation establishmentâand it has grown to maturity in Australiaâwhich is meeting more than Australia's total wood needs. In fact, under these regional forest agreements, in the last 12 months 600,000 cubic metres of logs were exported overseas, largely to Korea, out of our plantations without downstream processing, without jobs, without the economic return that this country should have had for investment in those plantations, because the regional forest agreement process uses public money to subsidise the destruction of native forests against the wishes of the Australian people. It does that because the woodchip corporations, amongst other things, are such handy cheque writers for the coffers of the big political parties. So we have this extraordinary situation where 80 per cent of Australians want this destruction stopped because they know that it is unnecessary and that there are alternatives, but 80-plus per cent of the political establishment votes for it, like members of this chamber. There is a failure of democracy there simply because of the power of the woodchip corporations. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âRubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âSenator, you will have your opportunity to get up and defend that statement.

It is good to see that they have finally been done. I just hope that there will be more employment as a result of these agreements being signed. I suspect that in Victoria they will probably lead to more employment because the Victorian government, both the current Labor government and the former Liberal government, has taken a different view to that taken in my home state on what we should be doing with the forest resource.</para></talk.start><para>When this process started, a long period of time ago, it was intended that it would generate a significant amount of employment and that we would see an industry develop. I am talking about an industry developing in manufacturing terms, with greater utilisation of the resource that we take from the forest. But in many instances that has not occurred, and that is the sad thing about this whole process. Despite the current federal minister making a lot of claims about his proposals to assist the generation of employment, nothing has happened. I noted an interjection earlier from Senator McGauran about Labor not supporting the regional forest agreement legislation. We did not support it, simply because the current government, which had given a commitment to implement the proposals that were put forward on industry development, reneged on those issues. You did not set up the council envisaged under the former Labor government, which you committed yourselves to prior to the election. You did not stick with that commitment. You did not set up anything. You set up a bit of a forum, and then you let that lapse. That is the reason we opposed the legislation at the time. You had all the opportunity, but no. Your problem was that you could not cop a situation where workers would be represented on a council by their union, a situation that would actually drive some development in this industry. That is the only body that has driven industry development. The unions were the ones that the industry came to when the issue about access to forests was a live issue. They were the ones that rallied their members. They were the ones that rallied workers to fight for continued access to native forests. </para><para>But what did they get for all of that, and what did the workers get? Very little, I would suggest to you. They certainly have not got job security and they certainly have not got industry development. Here we are, a country that produces a very small proportion of the world's wood products; we intended to have a great increase in manufacturing but we have seen a very significant decline in manufacturing. In particular, we are not utilising the hardwood species in this country to the extent that we shouldânot to anything like the extent that we should. Yet we know that there is a huge marketplace out there, particularly in the industrial hardwood area. We know that the major populations of the world, such as China, have a huge requirement for wood that we as a country could be supplying in manufacturing terms. But what are we doing? We are exporting a lot of it as woodchips and all-round wood. Frankly, I cannot accept that, and I hope that at some point in time this government will wake up and the minister will get on with the job and start heading down the road to proper and appropriate industry development and resource utilisation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>14700</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make some comments about the regional forest agreement in Gippsland. Senator Brown has made a contribution on the general principles of regional forest agreements, and I want to cover a few of those aspects in the time available. Regional forest agreements were a development of the former Labor government, and they originated from initiatives developed in Tasmania under a state Labor governmentâthat is, the so-called Salamanca process. Regrettably, with most processes you enter into with some in the environment movementâand I include Senator Brown in thisâyou become involved in a process to try to resolve disputes. They are significant disputes and they involve legitimate concerns about forestry in this country. But when you get close to finalising a position, the environment movement does not accept the outcome. That is Senator Brown's track record in this area. The height of hypocrisy in forestry issues is the attitude shown by Senator Brown on an issue he referred to in question time today: plantations. I can recall Senator Brown and some of his colleagues urging both state and Commonwealth, Labor and Liberal, governments to encourage the development of plantations in this country. Senator Brown has made comments to that effect on many occasions. He wanted to move forestry from native forests and old-growth forests into plantations. Of course, that is occurring to a very significant extent. There are some tax incentives to do that, and that in part is the reason for the shift to plantations. This shift was called for by Senator Brown in the past, and it is now occurring. </para></talk.start><para>Plantations are controversial. I have said on the public record on a number of occasions, before the recent controversies erupted surrounding plantations, that plantations are controversial. In Europe particularly the environment movement has had mixed views about plantations for a very long period of time. However, Senator Brown referred to firebombing the forests. I would like to make it clear to the Senate that you have to burn the waste that is left over from forestry operations, at least with respect to native forests in Tasmania. If you do not burn it, the regeneration that occurs is dreadful. The regeneration is not a balanced bush and you end up with a heap of scrub and rubbish, so you have to burn to regenerate. Fire is part of the natural cycle of a eucalypt forest.</para><para>With respect to plantations, Senator Brown alleged that dairy farms are being bulldozed, but the central issue is that farmers, certainly in my home state of Tasmania, in dairy and mixed cropping areasâpotatoes, onions and other vegetablesâwith the possible exception of the poppy industry, are not getting a reasonable return, so many of them are turning to plantations because the returns are higher. You cannot blame them for doing that. If you are a farmer, particularly if you are a dairy farmer working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you have the option of plantations being developed on your land, and those plantations are managed by either the forestry department in your particular state or by a private operation, then it is a fairly obvious option. There is a very important principle here: I believe that you cannot tell farmers what to do with their land, and Senator Brown is effectively advocating that we should be telling farmers what to grow on their land. I just think that in principle that is an appalling position to advocate. There are legitimate concerns about chemicals and the way they are used, shade problems and fire problems. They are legitimate concerns that should be taken into account when plantations are developed in any area. But as usual Senator Brown does not take a particularly balanced view on the issue of plantations. As I illustrated earlier, there is some hypocrisy in the comments he makes in this area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14701</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to add some brief commentsâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âDo you know where Gippsland is?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>âI do not even know what we are arguing about here at all.

It sets down the principles of certainty and balances the environmental demands with sustainability and employment in the industry. These are principles we are in agreement on, but when we came to government none had been signed. We have in front of us reports on three RFAs that have now been signed. The irony of it for a group that set up the RFAs, laid down very good principles and had our support is that not only could you not get one signed in your term of government but also, when it came to passing legislation in this parliament and supporting us in the RFAs, you refused to do so. You delayed until the union movement came out and told you to let the legislation go through the Senate. Your own union movement pushed you to support this government in the final analysis.

That means employment for the region and it takes out the disruption that used to come out of the East Gippsland area. There were numerous reports that the East Gippsland area had to endure under the Labor state government and the Labor federal government. There were at least a dozen environmental reports on the East Gippsland area prior to the RFA concept, and no decision was ever made. It was the most disruptive area in the forestry industry. East Gippsland now can settle down to a properly balanced industry. Senator Sherry was right about Senator Brown, that we are all utterly confused now about Senator Brown. What a mixed-up proposition he puts to us. At question time he tells us that there are now too many plantations, that dairy farms are being bulldozedâI suppose you can bulldoze a shedâand there are now too many plantations. We know only too well that he has pushed for the government to create incentives for the plantation industry, and that is exactly what we have done. It is now a growing industry; it is a market that is, quite frankly, taking off and we are very proud of that. Quite obviously the plantation industry supplements the forest industry. The more plantations you plant, the less you have to go into the forest to find your wood.

It also gives me the opportunity to refute some of the remarks made a moment ago by Senator McGauran.</para><para>If you are going to come into this parliament and make assertions, you should check your facts. I make that remark in respect of Senator Brown. He has a habit of coming in here and making grandiose statements, but never really backs them up with any factual information. Senator McGauran has just repeated the same error. For instance, Senator McGauran referred to the fact that we established the RFA legislation and process but had not had any agreements signed before we lost office in 1996. That is true, and there was a reason for that. The reason was, as everyone who has been involved in this process knows, that the first couple of years from 1994 through to at least mid or late 1996 were taken up with scientific analysis that had to be undertaken. To make it a fair dinkum process, the states, the industry, various groups and Commonwealth departments had to exhaustively analyse what was the national forest estate and all of the other scientific work that had to be done to form the basis for establishing an RFA. That work was being done at the time that we lost office in 1996.</para><para>If you want to criticise us, Senator McGauran, have a look at your own record. You got into office in March 1996 and you did not sign the first agreement until February 1997. Further, Jeff Kennett was the Premier of Victoria for quite a number of years. How many RFAs were signed while he was Premier? The fact of the matter is that the RFAs before this parliament today have been signed off by the Labor government in Victoria, not by Mr Kennett. Have a look at the state of Western Australia. Mr Court, the Premier, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, signed off an RFA for Western AustraliaâSenator Lightfoot's own state, and he is sitting here mute, not saying a word. That RFA was disowned by his own state Premier within a matter of a week. And whilst it is on the books, Mr Tuckey says, `There's an agreement in Western Australia,' and Mr Court and his government say, `There is no agreement.'</para><para>Further than that, the RFA process was supposed to have been completed by the end of 1999 when there were supposed to be nine agreements in place. There were only six completed. It is now six months past that expiry date and you still do not have all of the RFAs signed off. In Queensland, the industry, the conservation movement and the Labor government have reached agreement, but what does Mr Tuckey say? He says, `I don't like it. So I'm not going to sign it.' </para><para>In southern New South Wales, there has been a perfectly reasonable, far-reaching and visionary RFA negotiated by the New South Wales government. Mr Tuckey says he is not going to sign that. Furthermore, he is going to freeze the forest industry structural assistance package money, which is owed to New South Wales industry to do the sorts of things that Senator Murphy and Senator Sherry talked about, but Mr Tuckey says he will not pay the money. What we have here is a minister who is basically out of control when it comes to forestry, who is not really interested in promoting RFAs. All he is interested in doing is scoring political points. I seek leave to continue my remarks on this most important issue.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>14703</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>âOrder!

I believe there has rarely been a time since the Second World War when we have had so many conflicts taking place simultaneously around the world. Africa has always been a problem, at least in postwar years. When I was in Zimbabwe late last year, I tried to get up to see President Laurent Kabila in the Congo. I got as far as their border with Zambia, after going by four-wheel drive, by scheduled aircraft and by light aircraft. Unfortunately, there was a resurrection within the army there and the border posts were closed.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âResurrection!

I thank the senator who has been resurrected for that information! When I think of other areas around the globe, I cannot help but wonder where we are going, what part Australia can playâif any, indeed, in those wider areasâand whether in fact those conflicts are going to get worse before they get better.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to speak closer to home with regard to those areas that are of much concern to me. Fiji, of course, is one of those. The Solomon Islands is another one. Bougainville is another one. West Papua, as it is called now, formerly Irian Jaya, is another one. Then there is Aceh, part of the Indonesian empire, if I can refer to it as that. In all of these conflicts around the world, whether they are the Israeli-Lebanese, whether they are the Russian-Chechnyan, whether they are in Colombia or in other parts of South America, or whether they are in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, there is a common thread or threads with which one can identify these conflicts: they arise from either sectarian or land issues or both. </para><para>In our hemisphere I wish to speak particularly of Fiji, which is not a great land mass. It has an area of some 18,300 square kilometres, much less than Australia's eight million square kilometres, that is much, much more if you include our territories and particularly the territory of the Antarctic, or if you want to include our continental shelf, which makes us one of the biggest, if not the biggest, land areas in the worldâbigger than Russia and bigger than Canada. Fiji had a population in 1997 of 800,000 people living on 18,300 square kilometres. The other area in conflict, the Solomon Islands, has 27,500 square kilometres, with a population of 280,000 in 1986 and 400,000 in 1996. If you include Indonesia in the equation to get some idea of the problems facing those countries, it has a land area of nearly two million square kilometres and had a population at the end of 1999 of nearly 208 million people. So one can see that Australia is not only relatively well off, but is extraordinarily lucky to be in the position it is in.</para><para>Can we ignore those conflicts around us? What if we did have a humanitarian program that took just one per cent as refugees from Indonesia? That would amount to 20 million people or more. What if we just said we would take 0.1 per cent as refugees from the population of Indonesia? That would amount to more than two million people. What is our responsibility? We do have a responsibility for these areas, but just what is it? To whom or what do we give preference? Do we give preference to Christians? Do we give preference to Muslims? If so, what Muslim sects do we give preference to? Do we give preference to those that are closest to us? Do we give preference to those that are English speaking or to those that are non-English speaking? Do we give preference to Papua New Guinea or to their ethnic brothers and sisters in West Papua because they were part of a closer alliance that we had when the British ruled this part of the world? Are we to stand back and continue to criticise but not help in a real sense? We know the days of sending a gunboat up the river are gone and that we cannot do that. But what is it that we can do? What is it that Australia can do, given the gifted position that it is in today, with a GDP that is probably 10 times that of all of those countries I have mentioned close to Australia? </para><para>Are we to just offer some solutions in the form of words? Should we send in a police force or should we send in paramilitary forces, like we have in Bougainville, which is not ethnically part of Papua New Guinea? There must be some sympathy for that alone. What of the position of the ethnic Indians, Fijian born nonetheless? Between 1876 and 1916, 2,000 indentured labourers from India were brought into Fiji annually to mostly, though not exclusively, grow sugarcane. I think of my own country of Australia and its racially divided lines between black and white areas, into some of which white Australians are now not allowed to enter. Is this the lull for us before the storm that is coming? Is this relatively long period of peace, excluding the fracas or civil wars that have been going on, about to come to an end? Are the places like Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, Aceh and West Papua the touchpaper of an explosion of more significant forces in this area of the world?</para><para>I do worry about my country. I have children of my own. I have grandchildren. I look for a solution. I think a solution could be found if it was an effort made between both sides of parliament and not a parliament that has been used, certainly in my three-and-a-bit years here, to score points, no matter whether there is relevance in a suggestion from the opposite side or whether there is relevance in that which is promoted by the coalition government of this day. Something needs to be done. It is not something that I can offer any solution to of great significanceânor would I try. But I do feel very much not only for the Fijians and those other people who have been, to some degree, dispossessed of their lands, as indeed have Australian Aborigines. I feel for Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and the problems that he is having at the moment. I know that you have personal knowledge of him, Madam President. I have met him on one occasion and I found him to be most elevating in his dialogue; a very kindly man, a highly intelligent person and one with whom I had an immediate affinity. My heart goes out to Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, not just tonight but on many nights when I look at and read media news. I am going to finish, because time is almost up, by saying that we are blessed in this country of Australia. In considering the blessing that we have been given, we must share that great resource with other countries in our vicinity.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Workplace Health and Safety Practices</title><page.no>14704</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14704</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased that a couple of my fellow Victorian senators are here with us tonight to listen to this adjournment speech. I wish to raise a serious matter concerning the workplace health and safety practices of Australia Post in Victoria. Initially, I was alerted to the problem by a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 8 October 1999 titled `Bully Tactics Claim on Sick'. The article alleges that Australia Post employs a variety of alarming practices with the sole aim of reducing workplace injury claims, to the detriment of its employees. The article claims: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Victorian managers from retail and letter delivery centres allegedly paid bonuses for impressive health and safety records and have been accused of: directing injured staff to attend work and sign duty registers; hand picking doctors to try to overrule medical certificates; making employees use sick leave instead of lodging compensation claims; rewarding staff with gift vouchers for zero lost time injury achievements. </para></quote><para>It goes on to state: </para><quote><para>One woman's letter seen by the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> says her manager told her that if she came to work for even 10 minutes it would reflect positively on his centre's lost-time injury rate record. </para></quote><para>Little wonder then that Australia Post's official Victorian lost time injury figures had dropped from 30 per million hours two years ago to 10 per million hours. Any company able to reduce its workplace injuries is to be commended for its efforts. However, Australia Post appears to have implemented an ambitious and somewhat dubious plan to sweep workplace injuries under the carpet, or worse: force injured workers back to the workplace.</para><para>A number of Australia Post workers have subsequently confirmed the extraordinary measures employed by Australia Post. One such employee, Marcela Villalobos, a mail officer working night shift, went to see her doctor following severe pain in her wrist after a shift. Her doctor diagnosed a sprain and issued a medical certificate. On the same day her manager told her she must see a doctor nominated by Australia Post. With some difficulty, she saw the doctor, who then ridiculed her own doctor's diagnosis and advised her to return to work. Her claim for compensation was denied and the treatment that the doctor prescribed, which he claimed would be paid for by Australia Post, was not.</para><para>Already nursing one injury, she suffered a further injury and again was told she must return to the same Australia Post nominated doctor. When she did, she told him that her original claim for compensation had been denied. The doctor made a phone call, and she heard him say words to the effect that he was not happy with the way she had been treated. He then told her that he was sick and tired of dealing with Australia Post and that he no longer wished to continue his relationship with Australia Post. On the way out from her appointment, she heard the doctor tell his receptionist to contact Australia Post and tell them to stop referring injured workers to his surgery. When she did return to work, her fellow employees made numerous comments to the effect that they would not be getting their bonus, because she had been injured.</para><para>The doctor she saw was part of Australia Post's Injury Prevention Unit managed by Mr Anton Grodeck, who originally worked for Comcare. The Injury Prevention Unit has established a network of doctors identified as facility nominated doctors. It appears that the role of these facility nominated doctors has been to see employees who present at work with a medical certificate for either restricted duties or time off work from their personal doctor. The employee's manager immediately makes an appointment for them to attend a facility nominated doctor, who in many cases changes the original certificate. At times, these facility nominated doctors blatantly ignore the initial diagnosis and send the employee immediately back to work with no medical limitations.</para><para>It is worth noting that Mr Anton Grodeck has placed a close business colleague and friend in charge of maintaining the network of facility nominated doctors. Dr David Milecki is the man Anton Grodeck relied upon to handpick the doctors willing to do whatever it takes to meet Australia Post's demands to reduce workplace injury claims. He is also the man Mr Anton Grodeck calls upon to remove from the list a doctor who is unwilling to meet Australia Post's desired outcomes.</para><para>Clearly, the Injury Prevention Program has been designed to punish employees who are legitimately injured at Australia Post work sites. Any program which sends injured employees back to the workplace to perhaps further injure themselves or other co-workers should immediately be scrapped. According to other workers, Australia Post is too reliant on its Injury Prevention Unit to improve workplace safety and often studiously ignores obvious and dangerous safety hazards at the workplace.</para><para>Australia Post proudly boasts that it has reduced workplace injuries by `continually checking for possible dangers and eliminating unsafe practices' in its magazine titled <inline font-style="italic">PostScripts</inline>; yet I have been reliably informed of dangerous workplace practices and site problems that have been continually overlooked by management, despite the magazine and their claims. The truth of Australia Post's reduction in workplace injuries is in its willingness to bully injured workers and fudge attendance records. The use of Myer gift vouchers and other such inducements further brings pressure to bear on workers to return to work sooner or not report workplace injuries. </para><para>A large billboard at every workplace which records the number of hours lost through injury makes it even easier for co-workers to discover who has taken time off work. The pressure placed on injured workers is then twofold: from management through the use of facility nominated doctors and from co-workers. <inline font-style="italic">PostScripts</inline>, the magazine, also regularly provides details of work sites which have achieved outstanding injury-free periods through these dubious practices.</para><para>Such work sites not only receive Myer gift vouchers for each individual employee but also are presented with plaques and certificates. It is worth noting that the man who has often personally presented these awards, Mr Bob Finch, the then General Manager of Victoria, has subsequently been allocated another role within Australia Post following complaints about his performance and role in Australia Post's Injury Prevention Program.</para><para>Other injured workers have confirmed that Australia Post managers have forced sick or injured employees to sign the attendance book despite having a medical certificate for incapacity. The employees have been coaxed into their place of work under the misleading notion of outstanding paperwork, rehabilitation discussions or claim inquiries. Once they arrived for work the employees would be asked to sign in for the full day, so as not to impact on the centre's injury-free record. Sometimes the employees would be in their workplace for as little as 10 minutes but would be paid for a full day to avoid a lost time injury.</para><para>I have only touched upon the problems associated with Australia Post's workplace safety practices and intend to investigate them further. I believe that there are many more instances of abuse of employees' rights and that there is a fundamental problem with Australia Post's approach to occupational health and safety. I understand that the Medical Practitioners Board and Comcare are also investigating the practices employed by Australia Post. I believe that the Medical Practitioners Board have identified serious ethical breaches in the way facility nominated doctors treat injured workers. I intend to follow this matter closely and inform the Senate and my fellow Victorian senators on the other side of my findings in the near future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Biotechnology</title><page.no>14706</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14706</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to remind honourable senators and others listening to this adjournment debate that the Australian government's vision for biotechnology is directed to safeguarding human health, ensuring environment protection and enabling Australia to capture the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community, industry and the environment. I believe this to be a sound, clever vision and that is why I am extremely concerned that David Llewelyn, the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industries, is turning his back on trials associated with genetically modified crops in Tasmania. At the same time, other countries are forging ahead, investing significant amounts of money in the development of biotechnology. I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to outline some of those developments in other countries.</para></talk.start><para>In the United States of America, federal spending on biotechnology is $US6 billion annually, and in addition many states also have their own biotechnology programs. In 1997, members of the European Union had a combined budget for biotechnology of more that $4.4 billion. Germany alone had a budget of $900 million. Canadian government expenditure on biotechnology research and development is estimated to be about $Can300 million, plus considerable additional expenditure on genomics. The Japanese government in 1999 boosted spending on biotechnology across five ministries to $US2.5 billion, an increase of 12.3 per cent from the previous year.</para><para>The Australian government, proportionately, spends nowhere near these amounts, but is increasing its spending quite markedly. I pay tribute to the work of the CSIRO. They continue their work, which is significant. In his 1999-2000 budget, Peter Costello announced the establishment of a national strategy for biotechnologyâgood news indeed. The federal government is spending $9.8 million in 1999-2000 and $7.8 million next year, specifically for the establishment of Biotechnology Australia in the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and a statutory office in the Health and Aged Care portfolio to regulate gene technology and its application on a consistent basis. </para><para>To ensure safety, there is currently a variety of Commonwealth and state legislation and regulatory regimes covering products derived from gene technology. It is an impressive regulatory list that we have. The Gene Manipulation Advisory Committee, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, the Agricultural Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, the Office of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 all work to protect and safeguard community, industry and environmental interests in regard to biotechnology. In Australia, gene technology is now highly regulated and we have all bases covered. So the question has to be asked: why are the Tasmanian Labor government and the Green movement, in particular, trying to whip up hysteria in my home state of Tasmania? Gene technologies give us the potential to improve our health, create a safer and more secure food supply, generate greater prosperity and attain a more sustainable environment. I ask you to ponder a moment on the green revolution of 20 years ago and the impact on increased rice yields, feeding the poorer nations of the world.</para><para>Technologies, though, as we have witnessed with the information technology revolution, can radically alter society; and perhaps this is at the heart of much of the community concern. People generally have a fear of the unknown and are sceptical of science. But humans have been modifying plants and animals for thousands of years through selective breeding. What we are doing is speeding up that process. Australia must remain competitive with other countries. In Tasmania, we must not be an island unto ourselves. We must take on all challenges if we are to experience maximum growth. I am particularly concerned that the Tasmanian government has denied the Tasmanian agricultural company Serve-Ag access to its government research stations for experimental work with a genetically modified crop. Serve-Ag specialises in high-tech agriculture and employs dedicated scientists who are all professional people. They are some of the best people in their field in Australia and the work planned was within the ambit of the Commonwealth regulations, which has stringent requirements that I outlined earlier.</para><para>Research farms are provided for experimental purposes, to work in isolation and under controlled conditions. They would have been the most appropriate place for this highly regarded company, Serv-Ag, to carry out its work. Genetic modification covers a much wider scope than the Tasmanian minister for primary industries is prepared to examine. Unfortunately, his head-in-the-sand attitude does nothing to further opportunities for Tasmanian agriculture and Tasmanian exports.</para><para>Tasmania's north-west coast is a regional area with high unemployment. The Tasmanian Treasurer, David Crean, has acknowledged that jobs growth has almost eluded this area of the state. It is also the area of the state with rich basalt soils that grow most of the state's crops. These crops, which I have highlighted in the Senate, include potatoes, poppies, pyrethrum, onions, carrots, tulip bulbs and the like. North-west coast farmers and agricultural companies need to keep up with the rest of the world. They must. Their livelihood depends on them doing so.</para><para>The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association has slammed the Tasmanian government's negative attitude towards trials of genetically modified produce. A poppy producer, Tasmanian Alkaloids, has actually threatened to pull out of the state. I do not need to explain what that would do to local farmers, unemployment figures and the state's growth. Selected crops stand to benefit from scientific advancement, and Australia's cotton industry is a case in point. We must never lose sight of the fact that Australia's prosperity remains highly dependent on our ability to increase our exports to world markets. This is especially true for Tasmania. </para><para>I therefore take this opportunity to condemn the Tasmanian government for throwing Serv-Ag off its research farms. I also condemn the Tasmanian government's request that no further trials of genetically modified crops be approved in Tasmania. At the same time, I support the federal health minister, Mr Michael Wooldridge, in recently approving 14 new genetically modified crop trials in Tasmania. But there is no doubt about itâthere is going to be conflict on this issue in Tasmania in the near future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Disability Assessment Tool</title><page.no>14708</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>14708</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak in the adjournment debate tonight in response to the tabling of the Department of Family and Community Services evaluation of the child disability assessment tool final report in the Senate earlier today. I wish to take this opportunity to make a few remarks about that response. I have been pursuing the issue at the estimates committees of the Senate for some time and today, finally, we were provided with a copy of the evaluation. Since the child disability assessment tool was introduced to assess eligibility for the child disability allowanceânow called the carer's allowanceâI, like many other senators, have received a steady stream of letters and phone calls from concerned and distressed parents struggling to care for children with severe disabilities. Overwhelmingly, these parents were caring for kids with cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, insulin-dependent diabetes and PKU.</para></talk.start><para>Prior to 1 July 1998, a person qualified for financial support if the child suffered from listed or manifest disabilities, or if they required substantially more care and attention than another child of the same age without a disability. Since that time, due to the removal of some conditionsâincluding cystic fibrosisâfrom the list and the nature of the new assessment tool, many families are now ineligible for the carer's allowance. The nature of the CDAT, which measures levels of functional ability rather than levels of cost or care borne by families or carers, means that many more persons caring for children with severe disabilities are failing to qualify for financial support. While these families may still be eligible for the health care card, this only offsets the costs of prescribed medication. In the case of CFâto use one exampleâthere is no assistance for the costs associated with pumps, masks, ventilation tubing or sterilising equipment. This alone can add up to thousands of dollars each year. Nor does the CDAT recognise the complex and time-consuming daily treatment regime that requires considerable care and attention from parents or other carers and is likely to place restrictions on the primary carer's ability to undertake paid work.</para><para>The valuation of the CDAT table today did give explicit consideration to the assessment of CF, PKU, epilepsy, juvenile-onset diabetes and their possible addition to the list of recognised disabilities. Unfortunately, none of these conditions have been recommended for addition to the list. The problem with the review is that it did not get to the heart of the problem. The thing that concerns the parents who contact me and who contact their association and the thing that concerns Labor is the very contradiction this evaluation failed to addressâthat is, the contradiction between providing a carer's allowance for the purpose of supporting families and carers and using an assessment tool that is not framed to consider the financial, social or emotional impact of caring.</para><para>The underpinnings of CDAT were not up for consideration. The focus of the review was purely on the technical and practical issues that had arisen and the functional assessment of children. The review did not consider whether functional assessment is the most appropriate determinant of eligibility for carer's allowanceâthe review did not consider whether it was better than the criteria it replaced. While the technical issues are not unimportant, Labor remains concerned that parents supporting children with disabilities requiring complex, costly and time-consuming treatments, ongoing or episodic, do not receive adequate support. It is often the case that the extraordinary efforts and care provided by parents is the very reason that children are able to function day to day, even when their lifespan is limited. Ironically and sadly, these efforts may also serve to disqualify them from appropriate levels of assistance. </para><para>Clearly, these families are fulfilling any notion of mutual obligation. It is the government that loves to articulate the notion of mutual obligation for others, but it seems that it is reluctant to fill its own obligations. Families and children dealing with severe disabilities deserve more than this, and I and others, I am sure, will be pursuing the government to make a much fairer response to the needs of those families than is provided by this evaluation of the child disability assessment tool.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.52

If the book is acquired for more than $300, the credit is not available until the book is sold, when it is offset against the GST payable at that time.</para><para>(ii) and (iii)  For a box of books and house lots, where a single amount of less than $300 is paid for a quantity of books,  the credit may be claimed when the books are acquired, or alternatively, the bookseller may use the procedure outlined below. GST is payable when each book is sold. </para><para>If the cost of a bulk acquisition is more than $300, the bookseller will account for GST only on the value added by the bookseller on all such acquisitions.  Rather than claim an upfront credit on the acquisition, no GST is payable on sales made from these acquisitions until the total credits available have been offset against the total GST on sales.</para><para>(b) Where the value of an acquisition exceeds $50, the second hand bookseller is required to prepare a record which sets out the name and address of the supplier of the books, a description and quantity, the price of the books and the date of the acquisition.  It is not intended that a record be required where the value is $50 or less.</para><para>(3) (a) Yes but in the United States a retail tax applies in many States at varying rates.</para><para>(b) There should be no disadvantage to Australian booksellers.  Books that are purchased overseas via the internet and imported into Australia would be assessed for GST at the customs barrier, subject to a low value threshold.  Consumers who utilise the low value threshold may still find that there is little real advantage in purchasing books this way, once postage and handling expenses and the greater risks are taken into account. </para><para>(c) See (b)</para><para>(4) The Department of Finance in Canada and the New Zealand Treasury are not aware of any specific studies on the effect of a GST on sales of books in their respective countries.</para><para>(5) The GST will apply to the sale of second hand goodsâbut only those sold by a registered business.</para><para>Income tax cuts and increased pensions and other Government benefits will more than compensate consumers for any increases in prices for particular goods, including second hand books.</para><para>(6) Estimates of the GST compliance costs for a second hand bookseller are not available.  However, the estimate for the average net recurrent compliance cost per firm across all industries is $240.

sustainability of managed forestry operations for the purposes of the 2% renewable energy measure will be based on existing assessment procedures which apply in each jurisdiction, including those established under a RFA.</para><para>(2) (a) The quantities of greenhouse gases sequestered by native forests and plantations differ markedly with species, age and management practices and it is not possible to generalise regarding the quantities of carbon sequestered by an old growth forest, regrowth forest or plantations.  The National Carbon Accounting System is undertaking research into carbon sequestered in native forests and plantations of a range of species, growth stages and environments.

(c)  This will not be able to be determined until the legislation to support the measure is in place and an application for accreditation is made.</para><para>(5) The Australian Greenhouse Office is not involved in decisions to approve the development of power plants using woodchips to generate electricity.</para><para>(6) (a) The Green Power program can cater for the generation of electricity from wood wastes.  The current guidelines state that utilisation of waste from existing forestry plantations is likely to be generally acceptable under Green Power, as would utilisation of product from forestry plantations specifically established for bioenergy production  likely to be generally acceptable.  Utilisation of waste products from regrowth native forests would be considered on a case by case basis.  (b) Some renewable energy projects which may be accredited under the 2% renewable energy program may not receive Green Power accreditation, as a result of the different nature of, and drivers for, these programs.  The accreditation processes for the 2% renewable energy measure and Green Power is not expected to reduce confidence in either scheme.  The Commonwealth has advised the States/Territories that it would prefer to see biomass sourced from forests covered by a Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) treated consistently under both schemes as the RFA establishes agreed sustainability principles. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor: Official Language</title><page.no>14734</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2101)</subtitle><id.no>2101</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14734</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 March 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) (a) What is the Australian Government's position with regard to Portuguese being the official language in a country where less than 10 percent of the population speak Portuguese; and (b) is the Minister addressing the issue at any level.</para><para>(2) (a) What programs, if any, is the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) conducting to rebuild the East Timorese education system; (b) what language is AusAID promoting through these programs; and (c) what steps is AusAID taking through its programs to address the issue of replacing the many Indonesian teachers who have fled the country.</para><para>(3) Given that the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor has announced Indonesian textbooks will be used until the end of the school year: (a) is the Minister aware of reports that the Portuguese have distributed language textbooks to the schools; and (b) in addition, given that reports suggest that the Portuguese are planning to send in hundreds of Portuguese language teachers to teach Timorese teachers that language, what steps are being taken to bring all parties together and to work to a common agenda.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14734</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) (a) East Timor has no designated official language at present. The Government is aware that there is a strong view amongst CNRT officials that for historical and cultural reasons Portuguese should be adopted as East Timor's official language. It is the Government's view that the matter of language is for the East Timorese to decide.</para><para>(b) The Government will continue to encourage the East Timorese, in making their decision, to take into account the long-term interests of East Timor, including the desirability of adopting a language which can support the development of an effective education system and assist with East Timor's integration into the region.</para><para>(2) (a) Education is a priority area for Australian assistance in East Timor. Australia will contribute A$25 million in cash and in-kind contributions to United Nations and World Bank/Asian Development Bank trust funds this financial year. These trust funds are supporting, inter alia, priority activities in the education sector, including payment of teacher salaries, rebuilding schools, providing textbooks, and establishing a National Education Authority.</para><para>Australia has also provided A$1.5 million to a UNICEF Education and Community Action project which is reopening primary schools, appointing teachers, providing teaching materials, repairing facilities, and providing a schools feeding program. The aid program is currently providing seven English language teachers to the Civil Service Academy.</para><para>Restoring basic educational services, and improving service delivery, win be major objectives of Australia's longer term reconstruction and development assistance. Australia's longer term program of assistance is being developed in close consultation with East Timorese representatives, the World Bank, the United Nations, and other donors. In March, Australia participated in a World Bank mission to identify priority areas for assistance. The outcome of this mission will help guide Australia's program of support for rebuilding East Timor's education system.</para><para>In response to immediate needs in East Timor, Australia will provide up to twenty scholarships for East Timorese students. A reference group has been formed by Commonwealth and state and territory education departments, which will act as a point of liaison with AusAID and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on matters of education assistance. Australia's overseas aid program is also looking at further opportunities for assistance, including providing distance education courses, English language training, employment related skills training, and support for East Timor's interim national education authority. </para><para>(b) Australia's aid program will be guided by East Timorese decisions regarding language. We understand that Bahasa Indonesia will be the medium for instruction in schools during the immediate period as, even once a decision is made on the official language, it will take time to develop a new curriculum. Whatever the final decision, it is clear that English language skills will be important for East Timor's development and for building regional linkages. English language training will be a priority for Australia's aid program.</para><para>(c) Australia's aid program is supporting a UNICEF Basic Education Program to recruit teachers, and run accelerated teacher training programs. In addition, through the Australian Volunteers International, Australia is providing a number of teachers to meet immediate needs in East Timor.</para><para>Teacher recruitment and training are priorities for the United Nations and die World Bank, including re-establishing the Faculty of Education and the National Centre for Continuing Education at the University of East Timor. Australia will continue to work closely with the United Nations and the World Bank to ensure that these issues are addressed, and will provide assistance where required.</para><para>(3) (a) The Government is aware of these reports. It is my understanding that Portugal has provided textbooks and Portuguese language trainers in response to a request from CNRT.</para><para>(b) Australia is strongly supportive of a coordinated approach to donor assistance in the education sector. The most significant step to promote donor coordination to date was the joint education planning mission held in March 2000. Australia participated in the mission, along with representatives from East Timor, the World Bank, UNICEF, UNTAET, and Portugal. The United Nations and the World Bank are also working to distribute texts and materials as an immediate activity under the Trust Fund arrangements. Australia will continue to support strongly activities to coordinate donor assistance in the education sector.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Sahara: Referendum</title><page.no>14735</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2105)</subtitle><id.no>2105</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14735</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 March 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) What is the Government's assessment of the UN's current position on the referendum.</para><para>(2) Does the Minister have any information regarding the allegations that Morocco has employed delaying tactics, such as trying to register people that are not associated with the territory.</para><para>(3) In light of Polisario's opinion that the lack of outcomes is rapidly diminishing the benefits of the UN presence in Western Sahara, resulting in the threat of a resumption of hostilities, what representations is the Australian Government making to seek a peaceful and prompt resolution to the situation, to (a) the UN; and (b) the Moroccan Government.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14735</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe following answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Australia has consistently supported the United Nations (UN) on the holding of a UN referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara and supports the UN's extension of the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in the Western Sahara (MINURSO) for a further three months from 28 February 2000.  The extension was necessary for the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Hamra y de Rio de Oro (Polisario Front) to allow time for the completion of voter identification, the issuance of the second provisional voter list and the initiation of appeals from applicants of tribal groupings.  The UN Security Council has also endorsed the Secretary-General's plan to task his personal envoy to explore ways of re-galvanising the stalled referendum process.  Under the terms of Security Council United Nations Resolution  (UNSCR) 1292, the Secretary-General is to assess conditions and report back within the three-month extension period.  </para><para>(2) The conduct of the referendum process, including voter registration, is the responsibility of MINURSO in consultation with the concerned parties.  We are not aware of any coment by MINURSO on allegations of delaying tactics in the voter process.</para><para>(a) Australia is not a member of the United Nations Security Council and does not have a significant influence over Security Council decisions.  As the Australian Government fully supports the extension of MINURSO's mandate and the UN's resolution on the holding of a referendum, we have not had cause to make further representations to the United Nations on this issue since the Security Council extended MINURSO's mandate through UNSCR 1263 on 13 September, 1999. </para><para>(b) Regular representations are made to the Moroccan Government during visits to Morocco by the Australian Ambassador to Paris, who is accredited to Morocco, to encourage a peaceful and prompt resolution on the status of Western Sahara and to make clear our support for a United Nations-sponsored referendum.

Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) In April 1991 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) approved, under Resolution 690, the authorisation of the establishment of a UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to implement the plan for a referendum on self-determination to indicate the wishes of the population of Western Sahara on [fie question or independence, or incorporation into the Kingdom of Morocco. In May 1991 the Security Council approved plans for a referendum in the disputed territory. The conduct of the referendum process, including voter registration, is the responsibility of MINURSO, in consultation with the concerned parties, i.e. the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el-Harnra y de Rio de Oro (the Polisario Front). MINURSO's inability to resolve a range of outstanding issues, comprising agreement on the voter appeals process; protocols for repatriation of Saharan refugees, and security conditions required for voting, have stalled the referendum to date.</para><para>(2) Australia is not a member of the United Nations Security Council and does not have significant influence over Security Council decisions. However, Australia has consistently supported the decision of the UNSC on the holding of a UN referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. Australia also supports the extension of the mandate of MRTURSO for a further three months from 28 February 2000. This extension was necessary to allow time for the Kingdom of Morocco and Polisario to complete the voter identification process, the issuance of the second provisional voter list and the initiation of appeals from applicants of tribal groupings. </para><para>(3) (a) As the Australian Government fully supports the extension of MINURSO's mandate and the UNSC's resolution on the holding of a referendum, we have not had cause to make representations to the United Nations on this issue. </para><para>(b) Regular representations are made to the Moroccan Government during visits to Morocco by the Australian Ambassador to France, who is accredited to Morocco, to encourage a peaceful and prompt resolution on the status of Western Sahara and to make clear our support for a United Nations-sponsored referendum. The Ambassador's most recent representation was made in Morocco in early April 2000.</para><para>(c)Australia does not make representations to either the Polisario Front or the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), as it does not recognise either as the legitimate government of the Western Sahara. Australia considers the Polisario Front, a Saharan liberation movement founded in 1973, to be representative of an important body of West Saharan opinion, but does not regard it as the sole representative of the West Saharan people. Since many Polisario representatives also hold SADR positions, Australian Ministers do not normally receive them, because to do so might be presented as Australian acceptance of the SADR as the government of Western Sahara. Australian Parliamentarians and officials may meet Polisario representatives informally. The Director of the Middle East Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade last met informally with a representative of Polisario in Canberra on 12 April this year, and reaffirmed Australia's support for the holding of a referendum.</para><para>(4)  (a and b) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHCR) figures indicate that, at the end of 1998, there were more than 185,000 Sahrawi refugees in countries neighbouring Western Sahara. Included are 165,000 in Algeria (in camps in western Algeria at Dakhla, Smara, Awserd and El Aitin, nearby to the UN1ICR presence in Tindorf) and 23,100 in Mauritania (in camps in Zouerate and Nouadhibou, which both have UNHCR presence).</para><para>(c)UNHCR's operations for Western Sahara refugees are aimed at facilitating the repatriation of Sahrawi refugees, in accordance with the UN Settlement Plan and Security Council Resolutions regarding the territory. The implementation of the repatriation plan has been stalled due to difficulties in identifying and registering voters. Repatriation from the Tindouf area of Algeria, however, recommenced in July and August 1999. Asylum statistics show that refugees from Western Sahara have not left the region in significant numbers.</para><para>Australia's humanitarian program provides resettlement for those in greatest need of this form of protection. In Africa, UNI1CR has identified Sudanese and Sierra Leonean refugees as resettlement priorities. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
