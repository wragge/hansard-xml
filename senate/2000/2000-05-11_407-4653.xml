It is simply about censorship. It is a crude attempt to intimidate and silence Australian businesses from speaking about the true effects of the GST. The less that can be said about the GST, the fewer the inequities, the fewer the inefficiencies, the fewer the government failures that will be revealed, the fewer the broken promises that will be exposed. On the face of it this bill is an attempt to strengthen the powers of the ACCC in ensuring that price exploitation does not happen. The bill seeks to amend the Trade Practices Act to insert into the GST price exploitation provisions a prohibition on misrepresentations as to the effect of the new tax system. But the effect of the bill is to silence critics of the GST, to put an end to the growing chorus that the government has failed to deliver the GST it promised. The GST the government has delivered is a complex and cumbersome tax, a tax which businesses are fighting to implement in time for 1 July, hoping it will not cause them to fall foul of the price exploitation provisions. </para></talk.start><para>In this bill the government has adopted a particularly heavy-handed and inept approach. This view is echoed in a submission by Pricewaterhouse Coopers on behalf of the Australian Industry Group to the Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into the provisions of this bill. The Australian Industry Group is one of Australia's largest industry associations, being the organisation formed from the merger of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia. I should declare for the public record that I was a former employee of the MTIA, just so that there is no suggestion that I am in any way influenced unduly by their views. The submission says:</para><quote><para>The width and scope of the new provisions of the Bill relating to misleading and deceptive conduct and misrepresentations about the effect of the New Tax System raise serious concerns for industry organisations committed to assisting the business community in a proper and professional manner without risk of penalty or liability in an environment where the actions of the organisations are designed to help in a practical way, the transition to a new tax system.</para></quote><para>The government is getting the implementation of the GST wrong, and now business is being told not to say so. But this is not surprising. As was revealed in the Senate inquiry into this bill, Professor Fels, the Chairman of the ACCC, revealed that the 10 per cent GST price cap has no legislative backing. Professor Fels admitted that there was nothing in the Trade Practices Act requiring that no price should increase by more than 10 per cent as a result of the new tax system changes. There is nothing to require 10 to mean 10 to mean 10. Further, despite the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation on 15 January 2000 saying he had directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10 per cent, Professor Fels said that the ACCC had received no such direction.</para><para>This matter has been taken up in the other place, and the minister again has sought to back away and hide from his press release. I understand that it was a very difficult time for Mr Hockey in that January period. He was struggling with how much a bottle of coke was going to cost. And if the government accepts the proposed amendments that we have later on, under the amended act that we hope to get through he himself would have been guilty of false and misleading provisions in his description of the price of a bottle of coke. He himself would have been guilty, if we are successful in this chamber today, of breaching his own law. That is the extent to which this government is prepared to go to silence legitimate discussion on this bill. They are prepared to silence genuine attempts at discussion so that nobody is allowed to mention that the GST is a dog's breakfast, that it is unravelling on them and that their purported attempts to misrepresent the outcomes of the GST will cause enormous grief in the broader community. But that is what this bill with these amendments is designed to stop the government getting away with.</para><para>The ACCC has received no such direction from either the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation or any other member of the government. Why has no such direction been issued? Why, you ask? Simply because it cannot be issued. Because if the government was fair dinkum in trying to convince the Australian community that 10 really was 10 really was 10, it could stand up today, move a further amendment to this bill and say that 10 really was 10. It is that simple.</para><para>The government could end this debate. They could get Allan Fels off the hook and they could give the emperor some clothes. They simply have to move an amendment in the chamber today that says, `10 is 10 is 10'. I invite the government, I invite Senator Campbell, to stand up and move an amendment that says, `10 is 10 is 10'. You can end the debate today. Here is your chance, and we will take this up with Senator Kemp later in the debate. </para><para>This issue was poignantly pointed out in the submission by the Law Council of Australia, written by Professor Warren Pengilley. In fact Professor Pengilley poignantly pointed it out, just to assist the chamber. He said:</para><quote><para>... the ACCC Guidelines say that no price increase more than 10 per cent. This conclusion resulted from an embarrassing public debate in which Minister Hockey eventually was forced, politically, to give this assurance. But it is not the law and the ACCC is misleading in its Guideline in saying that it is. If a corporation's increased tax, purchase and compliance costs exceed 10 per cent, there is no reason at all, as the writer sees it, why prices cannot increase to cover these.</para></quote><para>In making the claim that 10 means 10 means 10 the government, if it were a corporation engaged in trade and commerce, would have breached the provisions of this bill. Further, the ACCC pricing guidelines state that where firms have dual pricing the ACCC would expect prominent notices to be displayed indicating that `under the New Tax System some prices may fall and some prices may rise but nothing may rise by more than 10 per cent'. That is rightâthe government will not intervene in this situation to stop the ACCC engaging in a political propaganda exercise on the government's behalf to mislead the Australian community and ordinary consumers about the effects of the ANTS package. This government is prepared to go so far in protecting its own political backside that it will assist the ACCC in engaging in false and misleading conduct. That is how far this government is prepared to go to ensure its own survivalâto actively engage in false and misleading conduct.</para><para>This is no surprise, because we have seen the John and Wendy ads. We have seen how far the government have been prepared to go to deceive ordinary Australians by spending ordinary Australians' money to run a false and misleading advertising campaign. Unfortunately, the government seem to have withdrawn that ad. Maybe they have finally woken up to the fact that those ads were false and misleading, maybe they decided to cut their losses, but the damage has been done. This government have shown that they are prepared to do anything and spend any amount of Australian taxpayers' money to falsely mislead them about the effects of the ANTS package. As I have said, a corporation will be in breach of this bill if they display such a notice. The government are insisting on this type of notice and they would be found to be in breach of this bill if the laws applied to them and not just to trade and commerce.</para><para>As I said, Labor will be proposing an amendment to correct this anomaly. We will be moving an amendment that makes the government and its agencies subject to the same prohibitions and penalties against GST related misleading and deceptive conduct as this bill seeks to apply against business. The key point is: if you are correct in what you are sayingâthat is, that you are not falsely misleading peopleâyou can support this provision; there is nothing to be afraid of from the perspective of the government and the ACCC in this provision. Surely the government should not be falsely misleading or conning the Australian public. Therefore you can accept the amendment. There is no reason why the government, if it is not engaged in misleading conduct, cannot accept these provisions. That is the challenge for the government today. If you have nothing to fear, if you are right and you are not misleading Australians, you can accept this amendment; but if you are wrong. if you have something to fear from this amendment, then you will vote us down. That is rightâif you have nothing to fear, you can vote for it; but if you have something to fear, you will vote this down.</para><para>It was also interesting to note that last week it was revealed how the ACCC intends to police this supposed 10 per cent rule. In a doorstop interview on 2 May 2000, Professor Fels said that the compliance costs associated with the GST can be recovered. He stated:</para><quote><para>They can be recovered, but they can't be recovered by means of price rises in excess of 10 per cent. They can be recovered by other means at other times and so on, but not by putting up prices at the start by 10 per cent.</para></quote><para>Professor Fels finally fessed up to the cosy little deal that he, the government and the business community have doneâthat is, that it is all right to put up prices later. Is Professor Fels saying that prices cannot increase by 10 per cent on 1 July, but that on 2 July that will be okay? Is Professor Fels now saying that business is to be permitted to stagger price increases over time or spread price increases over time so that prices may in total increase by more than 10 per cent? The deception by the government continues: is it one story for consumers and another story for business? Business and consumers are uncertain of the effects of the GST, and this bill has just added a potential fine of $10 million if they get those effects wrong. </para><para>This bill does not address the concerns of business. Mr Dick Warburton, the chairman of the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, said so on Monday. In a media statement dated 8 May 2000, Mr Warburton said:</para><quote><para>Finally, with the full ramifications of the ACCC's regime now becoming clear, there is an urgent need for far greater certainty and, critically, there is a need for greater legal protection against unwarranted and unproven accusations of price exploitation. The regime as it stands could be seen to infringe against fundamental principles of justice and it may leave innocent parties exposed to defamation with very little scope for redress.</para></quote><para>The provisions in this bill are highly questionable additions to the powers of the ACCC. The ACCC already has the power to take action against corporations engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. In part V of the Trade Practices Act, including sections 52 and 53(e), the ACCC has considerable power to take action against corporations engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. The government has already relied on these powers in a number of matters, including Sydney bookshop Gleebooks. What is different in the new provisions that the government is proposing is that they come with an enormous sting in the tailâa fine of up to $10 million for a corporation or up to $500,000 for individuals.</para><para>To show the enormity of this sting, let me compare the fines with the maximum fine payable for a breach under sections 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act and for a breach of the provision under state and territory fair trading legislation. Under section 53 of the Trade Practices Act, the maximum penalty is $200,000 for a corporation and $40,000 in the case of an individual. The courts also have the discretion to award an injunction, damages or other orders under section 52. The court can order damages, an injunction or wide-ranging other orders including corrective advertising. The maximum penalty for a breach of the provision of the ACT, New South Wales, Northern Territory, South Australian or Western Australian fair trading legislation is $100,000 for a corporation and $20,000 for an individual. In Queensland, the maximum penalty allowed for a breach of part 3, division 1 of the Fair Trading Actâthe equivalent of sections 51A to 60 of the Trade Practices Actâis $40,500. It goes on to Victoria and other states.</para><para>All of these penalties fade into insignificance compared with the $10 million fine proposed in this bill. This position is succinctly summarised again by Professor Pengilley. He states:</para><quote><para>The Government says that, by these completely out of line penalties, it is ensuring that âAustralian consumers are not being ripped offâ ... The more cynical of us (of which this writer is one) see the proposed legislation as an attempt by the Government to harass individuals with penalty threats if they deviate from the Governmental Goods and Services Tax line at any particular time. There is no inherent difference between misleading conduct generally and misleading conduct in relation to the New Tax System. The consumer is the beneficiary of each prohibition. Equity demands that all be put on the same basis insofar as penalties are concerned.</para></quote><para>Labor takes the protection of consumers very seriously, but the question has to be asked: why should misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the GST attract a bigger fine than other misleading and deceptive conduct? It is because the government views the world through the distorted prism of its blind obsession with the GST. It knows it is unpopular and is going through a window-dressing exercise to try to make people feel more confident that they will not be ripped off.</para><para>Let me make the point in terms of the rip-off. If the government are concerned that punters are not to be ripped off in relation to the GST, why will they not disclose the GST amount on receipts? Of course they will not. Labor will be moving an amendment to require the GST component to be printed on all receipts. If the ACCC want consumers to help them stop price exploitation, why will the government not allow a disclosure of the GST component on receipts? The answer is that they want to hide the GST. They want to hide the tax that they are so proud of. They want to stop consumers understanding what the amount of the tax is, what Peter Costello is pulling out of their other pocket every time consumers go into the supermarket or shop. The government have promised that the inflationary impact of the GST will be small. The government want the Australian public to believe that prices will go up by only 1.9 per cent because of the GST and then only after 1 July. Remember that, Senator Faulkner? Remember the famous 1.9 per cent?

But the Australian public knows that prices are going up now and will go up further after 1 July. No-one with any credibility believes that the inflationary impact will be only 1.9 per cent. On Tuesday night, the government came clean, at least part of the way.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âOr cleaner.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âThat is right, it came cleaner. The budget papers revealed that in the first quarter after the GST is introduced inflation will hit 6Â¾ per centâand that is on favourable assumptions. Many market commentators have already said that this is optimistic. Even before last night expectations of inflation were already increasing. Everyone knows that prices are going to go up now. Everyone knows that excuses are being used, but everyone knows that it is because people are trying to beat the GST. Higher expectations lead to higher inflation, which leads to higher interest rates. We have already seen the evidence of this in the last few months. The Reserve Bank raised rates yet again last week. People know that higher interest rates are eating up the income tax cuts that the government sold the electorate as compensation for the GST. If there is anything left after the interest rate increases, bracket creep will get it. It was also revealed in the budget on Tuesday night that estimates of taxation revenue show that the government will recoup the income tax cuts after the first year for the financial year of 2000-01. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>14379</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the so-called <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline>. This bill lets the cat out of the bag. The real issue of the GST is that bad. It is much worse than any other matter that involves misrepresentation. The bill sets out that misrepresentations involving the new tax system should be punished much more severely than other misrepresentations. No-one is saying that misrepresentations in themselves are permissible. We are saying that if there is going to be a rule of law it should be equitable, clear, concise and uniform.</para></talk.start><para>The bill would also seek to consolidate policing of trade practices matters relating to the new tax system by the ACCC so that the effectiveness of the body can then be regulated by the amount of funding in order to adequately deal with all mattersâwhich seems, in truth, a worthwhile aim. But I do recall, from experience in a previous occupation, that the department of labour inspectorate was run down federally by a coalition government. So its effectiveness in being able to carry out its assigned duties was reduced considerably. In that instance the state, Queensland, had to eventually pick up the slack. I will come to that point a little later. But one wonders whether the state might be the better place for this type of legislation, in any event. That has been highlighted by Queensland's position. It seems that Queensland is wise to the federal government. The Queensland government may not amend its fair trading legislation to accord with the proposed code. It seems this position is predicated on two main objections: the proposed prohibited conduct is already captured by existing laws, and the Queensland Office of Fair Trading is better placed and better resourced to protect Queenslanders against misrepresentation relating to the new tax system than the ACCC.</para><para>The ACCC's GST web site already makes it plain that under the Trade Practices Act, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 and the Fair Trading Act in Queenslandâand acts in other states and territoriesâbusinesses are already obliged not to make misleading or deceptive price claims about the GST. The ACCC proudly announce on their web site that they are chasing down companies for alleged misleading conduct about the GST. I am sure the chamber has already heard mentioned the examples of the Meriton Apartments and, recently, Video Ezy. In the latter instance, the ACCC relied on sections 52 and 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act. In this debate, it is worth while highlighting what those sections talk about. Section 52, `Misleading or deceptive conduct', states: </para><quote><para>(1) A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. </para><para>(2) Nothing in the succeeding provisions of this Division shall be taken as limiting by implication the generality of subsection (1). </para></quote><para>In addition, section 53A talks about `False representations and other misleading or offensive conduct in relation to land'. To ensure that the debate is clear, it begins:</para><quote><para>(1) A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connexion with the sale or grant, or the possible sale or grant, of an interest in land or in connexion with the promotion by any means of the sale or grant of an interest in land ...</para></quote><para>I will not go on to quote the rest of the provision. It is a very detailed and lengthy provision dealing with false representation and other misleading or offensive conduct in relation to land. But these two sections can be found in the Queensland fair trading legislation. See, for example, sections 38 and 40(g). To save time, I will not point out the similarities by going to those provisions and reading them. In section 52, the principal remedy for misleading and deceptive conduct by a person under Queensland fair trading legislation is damages. There are no fines or pecuniary penalties but, for a breach of 40(g)âwhich is the same as section 53(e) of the Trade Practices Actâthere is a fine, and I am informed that the fine is set at $40,500. This applies across the board for all misrepresentations in relation to the price of goods and services. The fine for a person is similar to that of section 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act. This is now proposed to be substantially alteredâbut only for the GST.</para><para>It seems a little unfair, particularly for fair trading legislation. Any legislation should be introduced on a consistent basis so that people understand the law they have to abide by. Also, it seriously puts in question cooperative legislation schemes where states practically mirror federal legislation. These schemes work by cooperation between federal and state governments, not by unilateral acts to bolster bad policies like the GST. The Queensland Office of Fair Trading explains quite rightly that the power to investigate and prosecute for misrepresentation involves unincorporated entities, and the focus of the Queensland office will be on small businesses that fall within their area of interest. The ACCC can continue to focus on large corporations. The ACCC have not demonstrated, to my mind, their capacity to be able to handle the possible complaints from both urban and regional areas in Queensland. It is very clear that the real point is to punish any evil person very harshly if they misrepresent the pricing effects of the GSTâmore so than people who misrepresent other goods and services. Therefore, it is a fair conclusion that the GST is very bad.</para><para>Let me turn to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It sought to be amended to prohibit conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services that falsely represent or mislead or deceive a person about the effects of the new tax system. However, the Trade Practices Act has already been amended, as I stated earlier, to do with problems that the introduction of the GST might bring. Part VB did this in two areas: prohibiting corporations from charging unreasonably high prices, which is the price exploitation legislation, for the supply of goods supplying the GST; and, secondly, giving the ACCC the power to monitor prices for a period. The idea about this legislation was to prevent profiteering on the tax changes either by failing to pass on cost reductions that result from the removal of the wholesale sales tax or by increasing the price of a good by more than the actual price effect of the GST on an item. </para><para>The bill tries to extend the scope of the existing legislation to deal with misrepresentations about the effect of tax changes during the transition to the goods and services tax regime. It is very helpful to look at the clause to ensure that the debate covers the detail because, as many people tend to say, the devil is in the detail itself. We need to go to the actual provisions, otherwise it is easy to lose sight of the fact that we are talking about rather nebulous sounding provisions in a bill. We need to be able to look at the provisions and state accordingly that section 75AYA will be inserted as: </para><quote><para>... a new provision to prohibit conduct, in connection with the supply of goods or services, that falsely represents, or misleads or deceives a person about, the effect of the New Tax System changes ... such conduct is subject to penalties of up to $10 million for a body corporate, and up to $500,000 for a person other than a body corporate. </para></quote><para>Secondly, it seeks to ensure that: </para><quote><para>The ACCC will also be able to seek injunctions to restrain conduct that is, or may be, in breach of the prohibition. The ACCC will be able to accept voluntary undertakings ...</para></quote><para>A mirroring prohibition will be inserted into the state codes that replicates the Commonwealth price exploitation provisions, with some modifications such as referring to a `person' rather than a `corporation'. The bill will also clarify:</para><quote><para>... the operation of the access undertaking provisions in Part IIIA ... to make certain that the provisions ... fall within the Commonwealth's legislative power, and to clarify the ACCC has the ability to ... exercise powers in relation to access undertakings.  </para></quote><para>Obviously, it is designed to deal with such things, as highlighted in some of the media, that the ACCC have been spreading about, like the Meriton Apartments matters. There the ACCC has advised us that they have instituted proceedings in the Federal Court in Sydney, alleging that Meriton Apartments and its agent misled consumers about the future value of the Summit Apartment properties in George Street, Sydney. The web site of the ACCC goes into some detail about that situation, and I refer people listening to the debate to those provisions.  </para><para>However, apparently the present powers are not enough, and Professor Fels seems to want broader powers with penaltiesânot penalties in the usual sense but penalties that might also apply criminal provisions. Under the proposed amendments, a contravention of the new section 75AYA will, by section 76, attract penalties of up to $10 million for a corporation and $500,000 for a person. This is a very complex piece of proposed legislation. For my part, it seems that in truth the motive for the bill is to stifle discussion about when and by how much a price is going to be affected by the GST. </para><para>One wonders whether free speech is being trammelled under this provision. One wonders whether the effect of it will be to stifle a reasonable debate on price effects, the GST and other matters. Perhaps the minister with carriage of this piece of legislation can provide some clarity about whether or not, if you look at the raft of decisions, particularly in the High Court, which go back to the Australian Capital Television case and later decisions about free speech, it trammels on people's rights to talk about these issues. The High Court has established over some time the scope of our Constitution to allow free speech, and one wonders whether this provision would survive any challenge. I do not wish to provide any scaremongering about it. I am sureâI said I am sure, but one would hopeâthat in truth the government has looked at this particular area and decided that it does not unduly trespass against people's rights to talk about the GST and price effects.</para><para>The provisions I have highlighted are very harsh. The severe penalties involved seemed to be aimed at scaremongering. One wonders then whether the ACCC may offend its own proposed bill by stating amounts of penalties that some people may regard as being calculated to mislead or deceive people into believing that they will be subject to them. </para><para>It is a very broad section, and I want to pick up a very good point that the member for Barton raised in the House of Representatives. Put briefly, the operation and the success of the provision falls partly on the states picking up the state price exploitation regime. Part II of the schedule is a template for state governments to use in order to apply the concepts in the stateâand that is where the federal statute cannot goâto small business people such as the unincorporated entities that I spoke about earlier.  </para><para>But since Re Wakim and Hughes, there is, to put it mildlyâI do not want to scaremonger too much amongst the corporate worldâconsiderably less confidence in cross-vesting schemes and their operation. There is some doubt about the stretch of themâwhether they can cover all situations or whether they will, a bit like tissue paper, be blown away. I do not want to scaremonger about that issue because the corporations world, as I understand it, is on tenterhooks as it is. This government has not addressed it in a meaningful way, and it still remains a matter that is out there. The government has attempted some legislative remedy but, in my view, it falls some way short.</para><para>In terms of the price exploitation matter in the state sphere, where it may be found to be an invalid exercise of Commonwealth powers, not being a lawyer I would hope that the senator with the carriage of this legislation could, firstly, put some of these questions to bed quite easily and decisively so that at least there is some certainty out there and, secondly, provide advice if at all possible about that particular area. If that senator cannot do that, this government may again be accused of being misleading with this bill. </para><para>Price exploitation is an issue that is out there in the community. There is concern that prices will rise as a consequence of the GST by 10 per cent and more, and prior to 1 July. This government is trying to convince everyone that prices will go up by 1.9 per cent and only after 1 July 2000. I am sure I may be accused of misleading people myself if I try to convince people that the likely inflationary impact of the GST will be only 1.9 per cent. The budget papers seem to have also confirmed my view by indicating that the GST price effect will be in the order of 2.75 per cent. Clearly, it will be higher. Inflation is likely to rise and with it interest rates. If you have a look at the impact on the households now, it is not a pleasant thought to consider any further.</para><para>The government has got to be kidding if it believes that this bill will address these problems. It is trying to stifle the debate about the price effects of the GST, and part of the armoury of the ACCC is to depress these expectations that run out there. These amendments to bring about changes to the Trade Practices Act are a blunt weapon. The ACCC could not possibly have the staff. If I am wrong about that, perhaps they can inform me during this debate if they can undertake the scale of investigations that Professor Fels promises. I think the more likely answer is that the bill is simply a shocking example of the government trying to silence its critics of the GST. </para><para>What will we see next? Will it be a blank cheque to Professor Fels to do whatever it takes to paint the GST in a positive light and stifle all debate? Then it is likely to be unlawful for me to criticise the GST. One wonders when this matter will be put to bed. In fact, just pondering that thought, the introduction of this legislation might put me in that frame. Perhaps the minister can allay my concerns about that.</para><para>One interesting matter that has arisen is mentioned in a speech to the Australian Retailers Association at their first annual retail congress on 4 April 2000 on the role and function of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In that speech, Professor Fels stated:</para><quote><para>The changes to the tax system will result in a change in most prices.</para></quote><para>He then went on:</para><quote><para>... where prices do rise it should be by less than 10 per cent.</para></quote><para>I highlight the word `should'. Professor Fels does not seem to have that much confidence that prices will accord to that. They did get an extra $15.5 million in the budget. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14382</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline> deals with amendments to the Trade Practices Act and it goes to a number of important issues.

This legislation really does highlight the general incompetence, ineptitude and false claims that have been made surrounding the goods and services tax. I will not go over the various false claims that have been made about the GST and its impact; they are well known. The Australian Labor Party have exposed numerous examples of false claims made in relation to the goods and services tax. This legislation also highlights the general incompetence of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, and I will refer to some grossly misleading statements that he has made.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>âHe's made a couple of those.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âYes, he has made a considerable number of misleading statements, as well as being generally incompetent. No-one can forget Minister Hockey's attempts over the Christmas-New Year period to explain the impact of the GST when the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was on leave. I will return to that in some detail a little later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The legislation that we are considering has been examined by two Senate committees. The implications of increases in rent were examined on Monday, 14 February, before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and Mr Spier, who appeared on behalf of the ACCC, was questioned on the issue of residential rents. Professor Fels was not there on that occasion, and that in itself is an issue of concern to the Labor opposition. But, in response to questions from Senator Conroy and me, Mr Spier made it very clear that the ACCC does not have the power to regulate residential rents charged by landlords; he made that very clear. Certainly the Labor opposition believes that, as a consequence of that startling admission at the Senate hearings on Monday, 14 February, and in partial response, the government has introduced the amendments being considered today.</para><para>But the government has introduced this legislation also in response to claims that the price of goods and services, in some areas at least, can increase by more than 10 per cent as a consequence of the GST. There was considerable public debate about this matter earlier this yearâI think it was in Januaryâand it is highlighted by the press release issued by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, on 15 January 2000. That press release, headed `Hockey directs ACCC on GST', states:</para><quote><para>The Minister for Financial Services Joe Hockey today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.</para></quote><para>Then comes a quote from the minister:</para><quote><para>âNo prices will increase by more than 10% as a result of the GST-that is our policy and that is the law.</para><para>âAny rounding that increases prices beyond the GST of 10% is unacceptable. And companies that try to profit from the introduction of the GST will face fines of up to $10 million.â</para></quote><para>I just emphasise to the Senate: this is the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation issuing a press release to the media and to the Australian public that he has `directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10 per cent'. I will return to this press release a little later.</para><para>We now come to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing of Monday, 1 May, where this legislation was examined in considerable detail. I might say that Monday, 1 May, is an auspicious date. Why is it an auspicious date? This is the eve of 2 May. Why is 2 May an auspicious date? Well, 2 May five years ago was the day on which the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, issued a very famous press release. That press release, headed `Tax report is wrong', states: </para><quote><para>Suggestions in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that I have left open the possibility of a GST are completely wrong.</para><para>A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy.</para><para>Nor will it be policy at any time in the future.</para><para>It is completely off the political agenda in Australia.</para></quote><para>Of course, this is the infamous `never ever' promise made by the Prime Minister. It is interesting that our hearing took place on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the claim by the Prime Minister `never ever' to introduce a GST in this country.</para><para>But let us get to the Senate committee hearings on Monday, 1 May. I think it is important to highlight to the Senate that the Labor opposition is moving an amendment in this place to ensure that government ministers and government bodies themselves can have action taken against them and be found guilty if they engage in misleading and deceptive conduct. This committee hearing did not get off to a particularly good start. The Labor opposition has been concerned and has requested for some time that Professor Fels himself, as head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, present himself before Senate committees on a more regular basis.</para><para>Professor Fels did write to Mr Hallahan of the Senate Economics Committee on 28 April 2000. In that letter he stated:</para><quote><para>I regret that I will be unable to attend the supplementary estimate hearings in coming weeks because of other commitments. However I am pleased to advise, in accordance with my normal practice for many, many years, senior staff of the ACCC will be able to attend and I am confident that they will be able to answer all questions.</para></quote><para>He goes on.</para><quote><para>In view of comments made by some Senate estimate committee members, I can advise that I expect to be available for the budget hearings which I understand will be later in the month. I would also like to state that the appearance will be my fifth or sixth appearance before a Senate committee in the April/May period and altogether I have appeared countless times before Senate and House committees over many years.</para></quote><para>It was this comment that Professor Fels made about his appearance before a Senate committee in the April-May period that I have to take objection to and assert is false and misleading. That comment is Professor Fels himself engaging in false and misleading conduct. We did check. We checked the record to see how many estimate hearings Professor Fels had been to since 1995. Professor Fels's letter clearly gives the impression, by referring to the April-May period, that he had been to estimates committee hearings. When we checked the records, he had not been to one estimates committee hearing since 1995 during this April-May period.</para><para>So Professor Fels himselfâand we did raise this issue at the commencement of the hearingsâhad engaged, through writing this letter, in false and misleading conduct. No better does this as well as other examples highlight that government agencies and government ministers should be held accountable themselves for the claims they make with respect to these types of matters.</para><para>With respect to the legislation we are dealing with, we received a very important communication from the Law Council of Australia, written by Professor Pengilley, who is the Professor of Commercial Law at the University of Newcastle and, interestingly, a former commissioner of the Australian Trade Practices Commission. The letter was endorsed by the Law Council of Australia. I will not read all of the significant criticisms made, but I will refer to a couple of them. The most important is on page 5 of that correspondence where Professor Pengilley refers to the constantly purported claims by the ACCC and ministers of this government that they can enforce a price cap of 10 per cent. The letter says:</para><quote><para>Similarly, the ACCC Guidelines say that no price may increase more than 10 per cent. This conclusion resulted from an embarrassing public debate in which Minister Hockey eventually was forced politically to give this assurance. But it is not the law and the ACCC is misleading in its Guideline in saying that it is. If a corporation's increased tax, purchase and compliance costs exceed 10 per cent, there is no reason at all, as the writer sees it, why prices cannot increase to cover these. </para></quote><para>Of course, we had two important admissions at the committee hearing on Monday, 1 May by Professor Fels in relation to this matter. It was under intense questioning, and I note the firm and decisive performance by my colleague Senator Conroy. With respect to the issue of increasing prices by more than 10 per cent, Professor Fels finally had to admit that it was not law. He finally fessed up that, in fact, the guidelines issued by the ACCC could not be enforced in lawâit was not in the law. There was also another important admission by Professor Fels about the so-called direction made by Minister Hockey in his infamous press release of 15 January this year. I just quickly refer to the transcript when Senator Conroy said:</para><quote><para>Mr Hockey has been quotedâand I think everyone saw it at the time in January or Februaryâas saying that he has directed you that no price is to increase by more than 10 per cent. Professor Fels, that is not accurate, is it?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Prof. Fel</inline>sâHe made a statement something like that.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONRO</inline>YâHe put out a press statementâI have it here somewhereâthat he had directed you to that effect.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Prof. Fel</inline>sâI think he made a press statement to that effect, yes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONRO</inline>YâThat is not correct, is it? He has not directed you that no price is to increase?</para></quote><para>Behind a bit of mumbling, the arm shuffling in front of the mouth and the glasses being sucked, Professor Fels said:</para><quote><para>Not in terms of a direction under the Trade Practices Act, no.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONRO</inline>YâHe is required to put that in writing, isn't he?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Prof. Fel</inline>sâYes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONRO</inline>YâAnd he has not put that in writing?</para></quote><para>Again, it was fairly obvious that Professor Fels was very embarrassed at that meeting. Professor Fels replied no:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONRO</inline>YâHas any other member of the government given you a directive that 10 per cent is the price limit?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Prof. Fel</inline>sâNo.</para></quote><para>What clearer situation could we have of a minister of the Crown, Minister Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, misleading the Australian people? He has not been caught apparently misleading the parliament, but he has been caught issuing a false press release to the media and misleading the Australian public. In the press release of 15 January, Minister Hockey said:</para><quote><para>... today directed the ACCC not to approve any business initiatives on the GST that may increase prices by more than 10%.</para></quote><para>These are Minister Hockey's own words from his own press release. He said he issued a directive, and we have the evidence from that hearing of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee where Professor Fels says he did not receive such a directive. I have to say I believe Professor Fels. Minister Hockey did not issue such a directive in relation to the 10 per cent, and I think we should be noting in this Senate the appalling performance of Minister Hockey in the carrying out of his duties, in misleading the Australian public in such a reprehensible manner about an important issueâthe application of the 10 per cent GST cap. It is a very important issue in public policy in this place, in this country, and I cannot recall a clearer case of a minister being caught red-handed in misleading the Australian public by his own press release. It is quite appalling behaviour from Minister Hockey, on top of the general incompetence of his performance in handling GST related issues over that Christmas-January period.</para><para>The legislation before us purports to cap GST price increases to 10 per cent. I have referred to Professor Fels's performance at the committee. We hope to see him back again regularly before Senate committees being held accountable, but what particularly concerned me was some further statements made by Professor Fels in attempting damage control the next day in response to the admissions made at that Senate hearing about this price cap. Amongst a number of other claims, Professor Fels did make comment about businesses not being able to increase their prices by 10 per cent but, if there was a justified price increase in excess of 10 per cent, they could in fact claim that additional price later. </para><para>In effect, what Professor Fels is saying is that it is not okay to increase your prices because of the GST by more than 10 per cent on 1 July, but it is okay to increase your prices by more than 10 per cent so long as you do it later in the year. Presumably, if you have a justified price increase of 11 per cent, you put your prices up by 10 per cent on 1 July and you put your prices up by a further one per cent on 2 July. That is effectively what Professor Fels was advocating the following day in his attempt at damage control in respect of this issue of the 10 per cent price cap. </para><para>I cannot recall an instance of a piece of legislation that has so starkly highlighted the general incompetence of this government in its handling of the introduction of a 10 per cent goods and services tax. There have been numerous other examples in the media over the last few months, and time does not allow me to go into those. But we do know that a 10 per cent price cap is not enforceable in law. We do know that this government claimed it was. We do know that Minister Hockey claimed it was. We do know that Minister Hockey has made false claims about issuing a press release to that effect which Professor Fels honestly admitted he had never received and that it cannot be enforced in law. Minister Hockey should be held accountable, at least in this chamber, for his behaviour. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14386</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline> relates to the new tax system. `A new tax system' is government terminology to cover the introduction of the GST. In fact this bill relates to the GST. That is something which the government describes as tax reform but which most Australians see as a new tax imposing higher costs and charges on them, a flat tax that applies equally to the most wealthy person in Australia and to the poorest person in Australia and therefore is classically defined in economic textbooks as a regressive tax, not a progressive taxâit does not tax people according to their ability to pay it; it charges everyone exactly the same rate and therefore is regressive. It is a tax that increasingly Australians have begun to loathe and reject as elements of what is involved in this tax package manifest themselves more and more each day in the minds of the community as people begin to understand in greater detail what is involved.</para></talk.start><para>Labor has fought valiantly in this chamber to prevent the introduction of the GST. Our policy position is to reject the GST. But in this chamber, in an unholy alliance between the government and the Australian Democrats, a vote was taken that imposes a GST. We resisted it. They had the numbers and there will be a GST by virtue of that unholy alliance between the Australian Democrats and the coalition government. Our position was, having lost the battle on the vote, that we would give the government the necessary support mechanisms and therefore vote for all the things that the government wanted that in the government's view would ensure a smooth introduction of the GST, and we did that. For that reason, we will not oppose this bill today. That means that if there is a hiccup, a problem, a significant unintended consequence or what might be called by ordinary Australians a stuff-up about the GST, it will be all the government's fault. They will not be able to say that the opposition interfered with their ability to impose this tax. We resisted it. We lost that battle, but we want to see that, if it is going to go ahead, the government's idea of how they should handle it is supported and the people of Australia can then judge whether or not this is a fairly operating tax. For those reasons, this bill will not be opposed by us. </para><para>The government is seeking extra powers. I want to criticise those powers in a moment because I think they go close to gagging freedom of speech in Australia by trying to stop companies, despite their better judgment, from criticising the GST or debating the impact of price rises induced by the GST. But the Australian Labor Party wants to move some amendments. I know these have been foreshadowed by my colleague Senator Conroy, but let me explain what they will do. The first amendment would require that the ACCC, the watchdog organisation independent of government and charged with the responsibility of ensuring that there are no illegal price rises because of the GST, table its quarterly report in the parliament and that the chairperson of the ACCC, Professor Allan Fels, appear quarterly before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration to report on progress. That is a small change. It has some considerable significance. It is proposed that Professor Fels receive quarterly a report on implementational problems with the GST. As it stands, that report would remain with Professor Fels. We think that report is vital information for monitoring the impact of the GST on the Australian community, and it should be a public document open to scrutiny and analysis and open to investigation and consideration of what in fact is happening. Therefore, it should be tabled in the parliament and Professor Fels, on behalf of the ACCC, should be available to answer questions about what is really happening in Australia as opposed to what government spokespeople want us to believe is occurring. </para><para>We are proposing another amendment to ensure that the GST be disclosed on the customer's receipt. This legislation would make it illegal for a trading entity or an individual to claim that a price rise is caused by the GST if that price rise is greater than 10 per cent. There is a hefty fine on an individual of half a million dollars and on a corporate body of $10 million if they do that. I come back to the idea of using large and outrageously huge fines in a situation like this without the policing powers to investigate and detect the problem. There is a thimble and pea trick in public perceptions being worked here by the government, and the trick is to pretend it is doing something by announcing huge fines while not having the policing mechanism to do anything about discovering whether there are any crimes and whether anyone will pay the fines. It is a piece of public relations chicanery by the government to pretend that it is actually doing something in the community when, in fact, it is manifestly quiescent in clothing itself in the necessary resources to detect fraud or contravention.</para><para>We have long argued that a basic right of Australians is to know how much tax they are paying. Any wage and salary earner in this country receives on their group certificate, and receives monthly on their pay slips from their employer, the gross amount of their income, the amount deducted from that in tax and the net amount remaining. We all know how much income tax we pay. It is a small step to say that, when you have a goods and services tax, on the customer's receipt there should be the price of the good, how much tax the individual taxpayer is paying in the purchase of that item and what the total amount is, so it is transparent and so we know what tax we pay when we purchase under this new regressive taxation system a good or a service that is subject to a tax. </para><para>The government has resisted that; it has resisted the right of the public to know. That information would be essential when a shopper trundles their supermarket trolley down an aisle looking at new prices after 1 July wondering, as they scratch their head, how much really that item has gone up or, if the government's arguments are to be believed, gone down, and how much of the final price they are paying in taxation in real terms. The government says there are 18 million consumers out there who are safeguarding this law because they will report whether there is overcharging. How can they report it if they do not know the amount of tax they are paying and cannot therefore measure whether or not the prices are properly passing through the tax changes and properly representing the tax increases?</para><para>It is not as if this is a difficult proposition at all. I was recently in Europe: in Britain if you purchase a good, on the receipt you get at the checkout it shows you how much tax you pay; it is the same in Belgium and Switzerland; and, as I recall, it was the same in France and Germany. So why can't it be the same in Australia? In short, what has this government got to hide that it prevents, by refusing to accept an amendment from the opposition, the amount of tax a taxpayer will have to pay under the GST from being shown on the receipt the taxpayer receives at the checkout? What is so reprehensible, in terms of consumer rights, that we are not able to knowâbecause this government keeps voting down our amendmentâhow much goods and services tax we pay when, as a matter of reasonable law, we all know how much tax we pay on our wages? Why is it different? So we will be moving an amendment on that matter to show on the checkout receipt the price of the good, the amount of tax and the final price a consumer must pay. </para><para>I might say in parentheses, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is obvious why the government does not want this information to be known. It does not want this information known because, if people know how much the GST is going to cost them in real terms, it will put a lie to the oft-stated argument that many prices will in fact decline by large amounts. The people, some of whom may have supported a GST, will realise what a scam this is and what a fraud has been worked on them. There is a right for consumers to know, and this government continues to deny it.</para><para>We will also be moving an amendment which I think is rightly to be called the Joel Fitzgibbon amendment. Mr Fitzgibbon is the Labor Party shadow spokesman for small business. He has been a very active campaigner in the Australian community for the rights of small business and how those rights are being trampled in this government's rush to impose a GST and impose on small business high compliance costs to meet the costs of imposing the GSTâeach small business now becomes a tax collector. He has been a strong advocate for small business in getting tax rulings from the tax commissioner so that the tax commissioner can tell small business what the law is supposed to mean, so they know what it is they have to comply with, something that the tax commissioner is notoriously slow about and, in many cases, has not provided a ruling, so there is no guidance at all.</para><para>The Fitzgibbon amendment that we would move today is an amendment which facilitates protection for small business tenants from unscrupulous landlords. Professor Fels, the head of the ACCC, the watchdog body in this case that will oversee the proper implementation of the GST, told a Senate hearingâand I was present in that Senate inquiryâthat the ACCC does not have the power to regulate rents. There is some necessity to provide in this bill power for the ACCC to oversee that the behaviour by landlordsâparticularly towards small business clients but towards individual tenants as wellâis in fact properly conducted. If the ACCC does not have the powerâand that is the evidence by the chairman of the ACCC itself, Professor Felsâthe parliament should give it the power. The parliament should ensure that it can do its job; and we will be moving an amendment along those lines too.</para><para>Finally, if I took the sense of what Senator Sherry was saying, there ought to be an expression of censure by this chamber against the finance minister, Mr Hockey. We all know the fumbling, bumbling way in which, when he was Acting Treasurer in January this year, he tried to explain why prices would not rise by more than 10 per cent. We all know the mess he got himself into. We know that when the Treasurer came back from holidays he had to try and bail him out. We know that many people in the business community are still uncertain as to what the government's position is. We know that he actually misled the community when he talked about rounding down, in his press release and on camera in a television interview. It was an inept performance, one that adds to the massive confusion in corporate Australia as to what they are supposed to do on 1 July.</para><para>If the government cannot get it right at its most senior level, how can individual companies or individual people be expected to get it right? This is, after all, the government's legislation. This is, after all, according to the Prime Minister, the biggest tax change in Australia in the last 50 years. This is, after all, in words that will come to hang around his neck like a dead albatross, `the greatest tax reform Australia has ever seen'. Wait for the hollow laugh from Australian consumers. The point here is that, if the government cannot explain its own legislation and if not knowing is not a defence at law reasonably, how can ordinary Australians be expected to know? Won't many of them be prosecuted because they listened to Mr Hockey and were misled but will be told at the bar that not knowing is not an excuse and the law is there? That places many people in jeopardy and, rightly, Mr Hockey should be censured. </para><para>I want to go to a couple of issues about this legislation. This legislation will impose a fine of up to half a million dollars on an individual and up to $10 million on a corporate entity if they do not comply with the provisions set out in the bill in terms of representing the impact of a GST accurately. This is an attempt at window-dressing by the government. I think that for this reason. The ACCC recently informed a Senate estimates committee that they have contractors surveyingâand their word was `occasionally'âretail prices. There are, I have to say, over 350 people on contract surveying prices in 176 cities and towns. As far as petrol is concerned, there are approximately 450 people surveying 3,850 retail outlets. So there is some price surveying going on. But there are only 74 staff Australia-wide specifically assigned to the GST. In the Northern Territory there is only one; in Tasmania there is just one person as well. Queensland scores the trebleâit has actually two people overseeing price changes in the GST. South Australia does not do as wellâit only has one. My own state of Western Australia has two people, in the largest state in the Commonwealth. In Victoria there are 17; in New South Wales there are two; at head office here in the Australian Capital Territory there are 19; and at a call centre there are 29.</para><para>Essentially, there is not the staff available to the government to properly survey whether or not there is price fixing undertaken when the GST is introduced. If you do not have the police in the field, you do not detect the crime. If you do not detect the crime, what does it matter how large the fines are? What we have is the government stumping the country, beating its breast and saying, `We will stop people from claiming GST price rises when in fact they are not, and we will slam them with huge fines.' That sounds good but, in truth, without the infrastructure nothing much will happenâand having one person in the Northern Territory, one in Tasmania, two in Queensland, one in South Australia, two in WA, two in New South Wales and 17 in Victoria is not going to solve the problem.</para><para>What we have here is a piece of public relations window-dressing by the government: nothing real, everything sham, and nothing serious other than to try and win the public relations battle. This government is fated to lose the public relations battle. Shortly after 1 July, when the GST and the much touted tax cuts come inâwhich Mr Howard says will leave no Australian worse off but which we now know, from the inquiries of the Senate, will mean, at least with interest rates rises, that many Australians will in fact be a lot worse offâwith all those things occurring, Australians will be able to see how much their grocery bill is and what the compensation is, and will then realise the compensation is inadequate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14389</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to speak this morning on the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline>. While I was considering my contribution today I thought about the complexity of this legislation and how one mightâas a small businessman, in particularânegotiate that labyrinth. I am reading at the moment a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Surgeon of Crowthorne.</inline> I was thinking about how one might comply with this legislation, and it seemed to me pretty apt when I came across a quote in a chapter headed `The Man Who Taught Latin to Cattle'. Dr Murray, who was the first editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</inline>, wrote to the British Museum in 1867 seeking a job with them. He outlined, with unabashed candour, what he thought were his prime qualities for employment by the British Museum. In writing to the museum, he said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>I have to state that Philology, both Comparative and special, has been my favourite pursuit during the whole of my life, and that I possess a general acquaintance with the languages &amp; literature of the Aryan and Syro-Arabic classesânot indeed to say that I am familiar with all or nearly all of these, but that I possess that general lexical and structural knowledge which makes the intimate knowledge only a matter of a little application. With several I have a more intimate acquaintance as with the Romance tongues, Italian, French, Catalan, Spanish, Latin, &amp; in a less degree Portuguese, Vaudois, Provencal and various dialects. In the Teutonic branch, I am tolerably familiar with Dutch (having at my place of business correspondence to read in Dutch, German, French &amp; occasionally other languages), Flemish, German, Danish. In Anglo-Saxon and Moeso-Gothic my studies have been much closer, I having prepared some works for publication upon these languages. I know a little of the Celtic, and am at present engaged with the Sclavonic, having obtained a useful knowledge of the Russian. In the Persian, Achaemenian Cuneiform, &amp; Sanscrit branches, I know for the purposes of Comparative Philology. I have sufficient knowledge of Hebrew and Syriac to read at sight the Old Testament and Peshito; to a less degree I know Aramaic Arabic, Coptic and Phoenician to the point where it is left by Genesius. </para></quote><para>That, it seems to me, is the sort of length and breadth of knowledge in languageâthat Dr Murray was advertising himself as havingâthat you will need to negotiate the labyrinth of this GST. I point out that Dr Murray was, as I said, the first editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</inline>. One of the most valuable contributors to that dictionary was the man called the Surgeon of Crowthorne, Dr W.C. Minor, a criminal lunatic who spent most of his life in the Broadmoor asylum. Maybe it is unfair to Dr Minor and Dr Murray to compare them with Professor Fels and the Treasurer. I will let you draw the conclusion as to who Dr Minor and Dr Murray might be.</para><para>As many opposition speakers have said, this is a very unfair tax and it is open to exploitation. I have had many inquiries to my office in Parramatta as to how businessesâparticularly small businesses, unincorporated businesses and partnershipsâwill be called upon to comply with this legislation, because they are being hit from hill to dale as a result of the introduction of this new tax on 1 July. You may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, that we were told time and time again by government spokesmen that this was to simplify the tax system. But you of all people would be well aware that this legislation that has been introduced contains the thickest, weightiest bits of paperwork that I think any of us have ever come across. This is not a simple tax systemânot at all. This tax system will become more and more complex and more and more open to exploitation. You only have to see how businesses are struggling to understand how they will comply, how they will avoid putting themselves in a position where they may be fined $50,000, $500,000 or $10 million. There are a lot of honest, hardworking Australians out there who do not want to put themselves in a position where they are not complying with this legislation and find themselves the subject of an Eliot Ness type raid by Professor Fels and his crew.</para><para>I am worried about the implementation of this new tax system. As I said, a lot of businesses, particularly in Western Sydney, are concerned that not only will they have to operate with the new system but also a number of them will have to comply with government regulations that they have never had to comply with before. You may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that under the old wholesale sales tax system only 75,000 places in Australia paid that form of taxation. But under the proposed legislation we will have a situation where anywhere between 1.4 and 1.6 million premises or sites or persons will be required to comply with the legislation that is to come out of the government. In estimates the other week we sought an explanation from taxation officers concerning in particular an area that I have some interest inâthe diesel fuel rebate. Still, at this late stage, industry does not know where and when journeys will commence and where and when they will finish or where people will be able to make an application for the rebate and where they will notâand it is only a few weeks now until this brave new world in terms of taxation will be implemented. As we know, this brave new world has started to crumble; I believe this system will as well.</para><para>The government has used all sorts of language in the introduction of this new tax system. It is quite Orwellian. There is something called a `new tax system price exploitation code'. I do not know if that is meant to encourage exploitation. I would have thought they might have called it `new tax system price anti-exploitation code'. If there is a code out there with that name, one would assume it is for exploitation; one would also assume that there must be one out there against exploitation. I am sure that is not what the government sought to doâencourage people to exploitâbut one would have to come to that conclusion. Maybe the brains trusts that draw up the titles for these pieces of legislation might wish to revisit it.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell, I know, as I said to you earlier, that this has been very unwelcome in my state of New South Wales. I am concerned about whether this can be implemented properly but also whether it can be complied with by those businesses and the ACCC itself. In November of last yearâon 11 November, of all datesâMr Nick Ellis, the Director of Compliance/Enforcement for the ACCC said this: </para><quote><para>The Commission receives in excess of 60,000 complaints each year. Commission staff, Australia wide, number approximately 350 persons. These limited resources and budgetary constraints mean that the Commission is unable to pursue all matters that are brought to its attention.</para></quote><para>I will just repeat that: `the Commission is unable to pursue all matters that are brought to its attention.' So the watchdog cannot follow in all instances. Only the other night in the budget there was an additional $22 million set aside for the ACCC to pursue the compliance and enforcement of GST related mattersâ$15.5 million for this year and $6.5 million for the subsequent year. I wonder where that money is going to go. We heard what Senator Cook said earlier, that most of the staff of the ACCC, in this enforcement bracket area anyway, seem to be holed up here in Canberra. I wonder how much of that $22 million is going to go for some sort of media officer for Professor Felsânot that I think he needs one, but I think that, particularly after his appearances in the Senate estimates committee the other week, he may need a bit more training before he puts his head on the screen again. I am concerned that this fellow, who obviously thinks he is some sort of Eliot Ness, is trying to continue to exploit the publicity surrounding him, not his role. I think we have seen on a number of occasions over the past year where we could not seem to get Professor Fels to intervene on matters that directly affected the public but, if there is a headline there, then Headline Harry will be out there in front of it. He will have the melon stuck in front of the television advocating what he is `gunna' do. We have seen on many occasions that that is about itâ`gunna' do this, and `gunna' do that. We have not seen him do anything that has assisted the consumers in this country.</para><para>As I said, I am concerned about the implementation. I am concerned about a number of those firms that are being almost threatened with bankruptcy because they do not feel that they are going to be able to comply with this new legislation. As I say, you are going from 70,000 sites or premises in this country that pay wholesale sales tax at the moment to around 1.6 million. How can those people, who have never had to comply with a taxation regime like this before, be expected to be in line trying to comply with the legislation? As I say, I think that it is an invitation to bankrupt them if they willinglyâor even unwillinglyâdo not comply with this legislation.</para><para>We have had also in relation to this a matter concerning the watchdog. We have seen with the compliance and the enforcement another problem, and that concerns the way that the legislation has attracted some legal comment. In the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> earlier this year one of the heads of the Business Council of Australia said:</para><quote><para>Some of the companies involvedâ </para></quote><para>that is, involved in the GST situationâ</para><quote><para>have said they consider a High Court challenge to the federal government's constitutional power to impose a price control regime.</para></quote><para>That was said by Mr Buckingham, and it was said clearly in light of the fact that there are some grave doubts about whether the Commonwealth has legislative power to enforce these regimes on small businesses, partnerships or unincorporated bodies. I wonder also whether advertisers or media outlets will be subject to the scrutiny of the ACCC if they unwittingly advertise prices that are in addition to the 10 per cent that it is going to be imposed after 1 July. I am not sure that that has been fully explained.</para><para>But what we would say to the government is that the way to solve these difficulties, rather than have this window dressing, is to have the disclosure on the receipts. That is clear: just put it on the receipts. When you go into a shop and you buy something, there is the additional 10 per cent on the receipt. I am told that in places like Italy and so on they have a separate police force, called the finance police. If you sit down a cafe in Romeâwhich undoubtedly you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have on occasionâyou are required to hold a slip if you have bought a cafe latte. The finance police wander around with their shotguns or their machine guns and if you do not have your slip on you they take you away. That is the way the enforcement operates in Italy, I am told, and I think that is transparent and honest. </para><para>That is not what is going to happen here. The government are seeking to impose, particularly on small business, a regime that is unfair and unworkable for them. I think that they will punish you very much next time, because I have seen what they believe about you. They believe that you have abandoned them. They think they have been abandoned by their natural party. I went to an anti GST rally about caravan parks up at Port Macquarie the other week, and I heard speaker after speakerâconservative retired men and womenâget up and say, `I voted for the coalition last time, but they have let me down. They have betrayed me. They are going to take away my money that I earned.' That is what they did. You are going to get paid back badly, particularly in regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âI just want to make the point to the Acting Deputy President that he of course supports the GST, and we would like to hear what he said to the caravan park peopleâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, George (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator George Campbell)</inline>âThere is no point of order, Senator Kemp.

The Commonwealth has the power to legislate with respect to corporations under section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution. Clearly the parliament can construct a legislative framework designed to govern the behaviour of corporations under this head of legislative power. But the Commonwealth does not have this power with respect to businesses, particularly small businessesâbecause they are not incorporated, they do not fall within the terms of the Commonwealth's legislative jurisdiction under the corporations power. Indeed one of the constitutional hurdles that the Hawke government found when it was grappling with the prices and income accord was this very lack of legislative competence with respect to the Commonwealth's capacity to impose price controls.</para><para>It would seem to me that the freedom of trade provisions also serve to constrain the Commonwealth's capacity to invoke the trade and commerce power under section 51(i) of the Constitution. Recent case law serves only to highlight the difficulties fraught with any attempt to legislate, and more particularly enforce, a regulatory regime which has effective coverage over all businesses, whether they are incorporated or not. The High Court's decision in re Wakim has necessitated a reassessment of previously accepted regimes wherein the Commonwealth had stepped into the breach in regulating areas of business conduct relying upon various legislative tools of cross-vesting. This uncertainty has only been highlighted by the recent decision handed down by the High Court over a week ago in the case of the Queen v. Hughes. The upshot of this decision is twofold: firstly, the Commonwealth may not even have the constitutional power to enact laws that give the ACCC the power to regulate and enforce anti price exploitation measures and, secondly, even if it does have that power, there are clearly a number of fundamental difficulties associated with current cross-vesting arrangements which may, by way of logistical concerns, impede the enforcement of much of this legislation. There is a fine book by the American historian Barbara Tuckman called <inline font-style="italic">The March of Folly</inline>. I suggest that the government read it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14392</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise in this debate on the new tax system out of particular concern about the legislation before us today.

I am glad to see Senator Kemp in the chamber because it is about time he woke up to some of the facts of life. There are real people out there who are going to be affected by this regime when it is put into place from 1 July this year. Of course there are many traders out thereâthere are many peopleâwho are looking at this as being a window of opportunity to have the people of Australia pay more than they otherwise could or should under any other regime. That is the clear reality of what is going to happen. No matter what the government say they have put in place to survey the price changes that will take place under the GST, whatever is being done is inadequate indeedâtotally inadequate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a simple tax system which the government sold to the Australian people via a massive advertising campaign, the Community Education Information Program, in the lead-up to the last federal election. The people were sucked inâthey bought itâand of course now find that they have a lemon, that lemon being the GST. People know in their heart of hearts that they are going to be subject to exploitation by those people who have the power to exploit them: the business people in Australia. Some of those business people will disguise it very well and others will not. The fundamental problem I have with this legislation is that, if people want to speak out about the exploitation, this legislation takes that opportunity away from them in effect because of the penalties that are envisaged within the act. When I saw this legislation on the table I particularly looked at what had taken place before the Senate committee. When I looked further I saw a very good submission there from Professor Pengilley. I know that prior to me speaking today some of my colleagues have quoted bits out of Professor Pengilley's submission to the Senate inquiry. I want to look specifically at some of the statements that were made by Professor Pengilley in his submission to that inquiry because I think they get to the real nub of the problemâthat is, that ordinary people in Australia are going to be exploited by the imposition of this taxation system. Professor Pengilley said:</para><quote><para>Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which misleads or deceives or is likely to mislead or deceive. It is a section worded in general terms and thus it was thought inappropriate to enforce it by way of criminal penalties. The section is enforced by the sanctions of damages, injunction or wide ranging `other orders', including corrective advertising, which can made under the Trade Practices Act.</para></quote><para>He is outlining in the submission the recourse that people have. He goes on:</para><quote><para>The above will apply, it seems, unless you ... say naughty things about the Government's New Tax System.</para></quote><para>That is what this is about. It is about the fear that people are going to say naughty things about the government's new tax system. It is about the fact that they feel they are being exploited and the fact that they feel the tax system is wrong. They have hanging over them a sword of Damocles which will impose a severe financial penalty upon them. In his submission Professor Pengilley goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Perhaps such a provision can be tolerated to the extent that it is consistent with other provisions of the Trade Practices Act and in particular s.52 noted above.</para></quote><para>That is why I quoted section 52. He rightly says that if it were consistent then maybe one could tolerate it. He also states:</para><quote><para>Where it is not consistent with other provisions is that, uniquely in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct, the enforcement procedures are all of those set out above in relation to s.52 plus a maximum pecuniary per offence of $10 million in the case of a corporation and $500,000 in the case of an individual.

People who want to speak out against this will find that they face major pecuniary costs per offence in accordance with this legislation. If that is not the intention of this, the government should withdraw it.

You have rejected this on a number of occasions. You have imposed an unfair tax on the Australian people. They have the right to see that they are not being exploited under the new tax that you will introduce from 1 July. If your criticism of the wholesale sales tax was that it was not transparent and that it was a hidden tax, you should not allow the GST to be a hidden tax so that people are not able to assess its full impact on their lives. That is one of the things that the government are sincerely hoping forâthat people will not be able to accurately assess the impact of the GST on their day-to-day living in the short term. They do not want it to happen. If it does happen, people who have to pay the taxâthat is, lower income people in particularâwill clearly come to the conclusion that the tax burden has been shifted to them. That is the unfair element of the GST: it has shifted the tax burden. People have not woken up to that yet, but they will undoubtedly come to that conclusion if people can challenge the fact that they are being exploited under the GST. What Professor Pengilley said nails this issue down.

When he was Prime Minister, he introduced, as everybody knows, the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-1907.

The idea behind Alfred Deakin's legislation is the same idea that has been behind all legislation of a similar nature since thenâthat is, to arrange things so that people can operate in the market in a fair way and so that people do not, through power, whether economic power or any other power, suppress those with less power, so things are fair and everybody gets a fair go, as we would say in Australia. Sir Alfred Deakin had that very much in mind when he attempted to obtain that situation very early on in the history of Australia. Unfortunately, the High Court said that section 51(xx) of the Constitution did not support that particular legislation, so the idea of a trade practices act went out of people's thinking for a while. </para></talk.start><para>Sir Garfield Barwick brought it back as an idea when he became a member of parliament. He tried very hard to get a trade practices act up; he could not, but Mr Billy Snedden did. He got up the Trade Practices Act, which was then overruled by the Rocla Concrete Pipes case in 1971 mainly on technical grounds. But the decision in that encouraged the McMahon government to bring in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971. In the end, the person who got the present Trade Practices Act under way and got the present system going was Lionel Murphy, and a lot of credit in this area must go to him. In fact, that act was challenged but the High Court upheld itâwith the dissension of the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick. It was very interesting to see that the man who brought trade practices back as an idea in the 1950s and 1960s was the one judge that held out against the legislation that was introduced and passed under the guidance of Mr Lionel Murphy. That is the interesting background to this area. </para><para>What I want to illustrate is that the traditions and the history of the legislation we are considering today, the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000,</inline> go to those issues of preserving the market as it should be preserved, ensuring that people do not use economic power in an oppressive way and ensuring that everyone who wants to can set up in business and can go forward without oppression. Given that, this present legislation is quite awkward. I think that the Trade Practices Act should deal with that idea of trade being conducted in a fair and free way. It is for that reason that I think provisionsâthis is an issue that has often been raised in this chamber from this sideâdealing with secondary boycotts and dealing with actions against unions should certainly not be in this act because it deals with other matters; it does not deal with trade practices as they are understood. This is an even greater example of how the act has been amended in a way that does not fit in with the history of this legislation, from the first decade of Federation on, in various ways, and particularly since the 1950s. This does not deal with oppressive conduct, and it does not deal with keeping the marketplace free and open; it deals specifically with an issue that is to operate for only two years, as I understand it. Why is that done? </para><para>This is clearly a wrong use of this piece of legislation. It is done in a way that does not conform to history. It is aimed at limiting prices in a particular set of circumstances. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, in 1973 there was a referendum conducted in this area in which the Whitlam government sought power over prices and wages. That was rejected. What has been said since, or even indeed before that time, by people on the conservative side of politics is that competition is the way to keep prices in order. If that is so, why do we have a piece of legislation here which is quite draconian in the way it operates? </para><para>I simply want to make the pointâand perhaps we will return to this in the committee stageâthat these are amendments that are very hard to understand, except in the terms that have been put forward already. The government is very apprehensive of how the goods and services tax will impact on the community and it wants to ensure that the blame, if there is to be any blame, goes elsewhere. This piece of legislation is aimed at deflecting criticism rather than at arranging things so that the marketplace operates as it should and so that people do not suffer oppression, as they should not. There has been a great struggle for people over the years, which culminated in Mr Lionel Murphy's legislation which in the end brought forward a good way of dealing with things. If we as legislators introduce this sort of legislation into an act that has served a great purpose, we are devaluing the legislation that should operate.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>14397</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not wish to take up much of the time of the chamber in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline>.

At no stage did the minister take the opportunity during that period to explain why he made those comments or why he put out the press release.

Last year this parliament passed amendments to the Trade Practices Act, inserting a new part VB into that act which, firstly, prohibits corporations charging unreasonably high prices for the supply of goods having regard to the new tax system changes and, secondly, empowers the ACCC to monitor prices for a period of one year before and two years after the implementation of the GST.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation also introduced the new tax system price exploitation code. Because of constitutional limitations, all states and territories, except the ACT, have implemented a uniform new tax system price exploitation code. That state legislation essentially gives the ACCC the same powers and functions as those in part VB, but in respect of individuals rather than corporations. Clearly, the intention of that legislation is to prevent profiteering on the tax changes either by failing to pass on cost reductions that result from the removal of wholesale sales tax and other taxes or by increasing the price of a good by more than the actual price effect of the GST on an item. Most public attention has been on price but cost reductions are as important an issue.</para><para>I will turn to this bill, the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline>. The bill seeks to extend the scope of the regulatory regime in part VB to cover misrepresentation about the effect of tax changes during the transition to the new tax system. The sorts of conduct which are the subject of concern and which the bill seeks to outlaw are claims that a consumer is required to pay an amount for the GST when, in fact, the obligation does not take effect until 1 July 2000 or advertisements which encourage consumers to buy goods or services now in order to beat the GST when prices may fall rather than rise under the new tax system. Under the amendments, a contravention of the new provision will attract a pecuniary penalty of up to $10 million for a corporation and up to $500,000 for an individual. These penalties are consistent with the existing penalties for price exploitation under part VB which, as I have said, have been agreed to by the statesâLabor and coalition alike.</para><para>In the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearings into this bill, the issue which arose was the size of the maximum penalties which could be imposed for a breach of the new provision. Professor Warren Pengilley from the University of Newcastle raised serious concerns about the inconsistency in penalties for ordinary misleading and deceptive conduct and misleading conduct in relation to the new tax systemâand `ordinary' is the word he used. He suggested, `Equity demands that all be put on the same basis in so far as penalties are concerned.'</para><para>The ACCC's response in relation to the extent of the penalties was that it had `always argued that the current penalties are too low and should be increased'. The representative of Treasury conceded that there is an issue in respect of the consistency of penalty levels. On that basis, the Democrats think it is appropriate for the government to give consideration to the current maximum penalties applying for breaches of section 53 of the act and to determine whether those penalties are adequate or whether they ought to be brought into line with the penalties which apply for a contravention of the provisions of this bill. In other words, the argument should not be to drop the penalties that are proposed by the bill but, in fact, to increase the penalties that are in existence in the act. That is a far more important focus for the Senate, in my belief, which would give the ACCC increased clout and which has been conceded by Treasury and advocated by the ACCC. </para><para>The penalties set out in the Trade Practices Act are maximum penalties. The precise penalty that applies to each particular contravention is adjudged by a court based on, among other things, the gravity of the offence. You cannot argue in one bill that the courts should have the ability to determine these things on a reasonable basis and with judgment and discretion and then, when you reach this bill, argue that the courts will not be able to do that properly and effectively. Consistency demands that we should accept that courts would be able to adjudicate what is a reasonable mistake, what is reasonable to be considered under these provisions and whether the maximum penalty or some lesser penalty applies.</para><para>The nature and size of corporations and the types of conduct in which they can engage, particularly multinational corporations, mean that penalties must be sufficiently substantial to have a deterrent effect. It should not be the case that a very large corporation can decide to deliberately engage in unlawful conduct because it knows that, even if the maximum penalty is applied for the breach, the revenue it has derived as a result of the breach will exceed the amount of that maximum penalty. As an aside, it is my understanding that that is the reason why penalties were recently increased fivefold for aircraft departing Sydney airport during the curfew period. Penalties must be high enough to have a deterrent effect, and that is plainly the case with this bill. </para><para>I will just comment briefly on Labor's amendmentsâand I will deal with them at a greater level during the debate. Labor's separate itemisation of the GST on receipts approach is a rehash of previous amendments that it has put up, and I will comment on that yet again when we deal with it later. Legislating that the Chairman of the ACCC will appear before a House of Representatives standing committee is simply not necessary. Both houses have the right to subpoena. Both houses, if they wish, can make people appear before them. There is no reason whatsoever that we should have legislation for Professor Fels, members of the commission or its staff that enacts something which both houses already have the power to insist on. We do not support limiting the prohibition on misrepresentations to misrepresentations that occur for price exploitation alone, and we will comment on that. Also, we will be amending Labor's amendment relating to applying these provisions to the government.</para><para>The other amendment that was read out by Senator George Campbell, which is a second reading amendment, attracted my attention until I heard the last phrase. Frankly, if the Labor Party were asking the government to ensure that it complies with the press release put out by Minister Hockey and saying that it should give a direction, if that were missing, to the ACCC, then the Australian Democrats would support that. But a motion of censure on that basis is just not sensible. Surely the question is really whether the ACCC have been given direction or not. Therefore, we think that Labor's amendment is misfocused. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill and we look forward to the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>14399</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the <inline ref="R1024">A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000</inline>.

So here again the Labor Party, the Labor movement generally, will do whatever it takes. They will ignore the interests of consumers. They will ignore the interests of small business people who want to get on with lodging their applications for Australian business numbers. They will do whatever it takes for their narrow, pathetic, political interests.</para><para>The further thing they have done is totally unprecedented in this place, on the advice I have been able to get in the short time since this pathetic, puerile and pious second reading amendment has been distributed and moved by Senator George Campbell. It is the first time in Australian Senate history that they have tried to censure a minister by way of a second reading amendment. That is on the advice I have been able to get today, and I am happy to stand corrected. This is a sad and sorry opposition who have no policies, who are effectively a one-trick ponyâall they can do is bash the GST day in and day out. They tried bashing the surplus this week. They tried to change their political tack, they tried a new concept, and bashed the surplus. In fact, Mr Crean was so keen on bashing the surplus that he said he would spend it. These guys are so good at deficits and, after seeing a surplus, what did Mr Crean say on television the other night? In answer to the question, `What would you do with a surplus?' he said, `We'd spend it.' He was not sure what he would spend it on, but he said he would look around and see if he could find something to spend it on. He said, `We'll invest it in the future of the nation.' That's a beauty! That is what Labor say when they see a surplus, `Let's spend it as quick as we can and let's get back into deficit. Let's get those interest rates racking up.'</para><para>What have they done today? To delay, to confuse and to stop the trade practices amendments going in which will add to the protections for consumers in Australia, they have said, `Let's censure Mr Hockey.' Normally when you censure a ministerâas you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you have been here through a number of censure motions in your timeâyou allow there to be a proper debate on the censure, a structured debate where the minister can have his position defended. You would normally have discussions with the opposition parties, the government parties and the other parties in this place about how many speakers you might have. There would be arrangements put in place by the whip, but today we have come in here and, with about three minutes notice, they have said that we are going to have a censure motion. They will do anything to stop this coming through, including tagging on a censure motion to a pious second reading amendment. I do not know who is running the tactics on the other side, but whoever he is should be cross-examined, if not have their head examined, by more senior and more sensible people in the opposition.</para><para>To pull on a censure of a minister with less than 50 minutes to go in the time allocated for debate is one of the most gross violations of proper procedure. It is totally unprecedented in Senate history, as far as our records show. It absolutely shows how bereft the Australian Labor Party are not only of policy but also of tactical implementation of a debate. We want this bill through this place today. We want to ensure that consumers get the benefit of these significant protections, but the Australian Labor Party have made it clear now privately, and probably in a few minutes time publicly, that they do not want it through for the next three weeks. We would like it in place. We would like this scheme up and running. It could be today, if we could get it passed before a quarter to one, but these wreckers, these anarchists, on the other side of the chamber have made it clear that that will not take place. We will be opposing this stupid, pious, pathetic, puerile amendment, and we will be supporting the second reading, of course. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>14401</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâFirstly, I indicated that, following discussions with the Australian Democrats on an amended second reading amendment, we are happy to support the amended amendment suggested by the Democrats on this issue.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âAre we going to see an amendment?

So in actual fact we are inside the two months right now. The states have the power, which this government acknowledges, to vary the implementation date.

Senator George Campbell has been here for only a relatively short time. He has got up, and in the last minute he has said that he is about to make a second reading speech that he would have madeâI do not quite know why he did notâand now he has gone on to say that he is going to discuss the second reading amendment, which we have actually just passed. I think perhaps he should be directed to, at least in some way, try to focus his remarks on the committee stage of this billânot to make a second reading speech and certainly not to discuss an amendment which has already passed. If he wants to be a commentator on the Senate's activities and the matters that are passed by the Senate, he could probably seek to get a job at the ABC or perhaps even in the sound booth where journalists comment.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âOrder!

In relation to my comments, I did not say at any stage that I was going to make a second reading speech. I said I was going to make some comments that I originally intended to make in the second reading stage of the bill, but I would make them in the context of the committee stage. I did not indicate that I was going to make a second reading speech. The second point is that the issue of debate in this bill is the central issue in the press release issued by Minister Hockey on 15 January. It went to the powers of the ACCC and whether or not, at law, they were able to do the sorts of things that Minister Hockey was claiming. It goes to the substance of what this bill is all about. I may have been here only a relatively short period of time, but I think I have picked up more about the procedure than Senator Ian Campbell has in the long time that he has been here.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThank you.

As I indicated, I happened to see him enjoying the sun at Bondi beach the day the press release was made, and maybe he was suffering from a bit too much heat when he issued the press release. What is more pertinent than what Minister Hockey said in the press release is that no-one in the government from 15 January until today has taken the opportunity to refute what the minister said in that press release. No-one has taken the opportunity to draw attention to the fact that he had not complied with the act in respect of that matter and that the law did not provide a capacity under the Trade Practices Act to put a price cap of 10 per cent on the application of the GST. That was admitted by Professor Fels, the Chairman of the ACCC, at a Senate legislation committee hearing on Monday of last week. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It has been attempted, in the process of this bill, to create employment opportunities through all of the mechanisms that will surround the application of the new tax system.

So we are creating police forces all around the country as key elements to deliver the government's new tax system.

The truth of the matter is that we have seen a substantial budget surplus squandered by this government in order to try to buy public support for the GST. What is this trade practices amendment about? It is about simply trying to create the public facade that somehow or another we have a government body out there protecting the interests of consumers in terms of there being no price exploitation as a result of the operation of the new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is the truth of the matter? When those of us who have participated in Senate legislation committee hearings on the new tax system over a period of some 18 months, and as late as last week in respect of this particular bill, asked the ACCC officers how many people were in place to monitor this, they gave us a list. I think there was one in Queensland, two in New South Wales and 17 in Victoria. We asked why there were 17 in Victoria and only two in New South Wales, and they said, `We happen to have a bigger office down there, so we have obviously got more bodies.' We asked them why there were 19 in the ACT, and they said, `We've got our head office there, and so we've got more bodies there.' But they have got only one in Tasmania and one in Western Australia, and they may have one or half of one in the Northern Territory. They have 30 or 40 people around the country designated to administer this act and to monitor the impact of prices right throughout the whole of our economy in terms of whether they meet the guidelines laid down by the ACCC. </para><para>I actually felt embarrassed for the ACCC officers who appeared before the Senate legislation committee: you have to be fair and say that, as public servants, they were trying to do a reasonable job in presenting the views of their masters. But it was very, very difficult. It was very difficult for them to be able to put up any defence in terms of what this government was doing or the credibility of the ACCC in respect of the administration of this tax system.</para><para>I thought there was damning evidence given to the committee. There were two aspects of the evidence put before the committee which are of major concern. One was the issues raised by the Australian Industry Group, I think, which went to the type of information that industry bodies may provide to their members. I know that that organisation has, for example, been holding seminars all around the country and has been getting in manufacturers from within the metal manufacturing area, the printing area and all the industry areas that it represents and has been trying, using the best of its officers, to explain as best it can how this dog's breakfast of a tax is going to impact upon the membership, whether that be small businesses, jobbing shops or big businesses like BHP or what have you. They have raised some real concerns about the way in which this trade practices amendment bill will be implemented.</para><para>Here you have industry bodies acting in good faith and trying to equip their members as best they can to deal with what is a very complex tax system now. I think that the last weigh-in was about 5Â½ kilos, and it may even be over that by this point in timeânowhere near as heavy, I might add, as the advertising that is going out in terms of trying to promote the new tax system: $360 million will buy you more than 5Â½ kilos of paper, in terms of promoting it. Nevertheless, it is very substantial. They are concerned that they could be put in a position of actually being prosecuted under the provisions of this new amendment and facing fines of anywhere up to $10 million. From what I have read of their submission, I think they have made it clear that they will be withdrawing from that sort of activity; that they are not going to put themselves as an organisation in a position where they can be confronted with those types of fines. That is going to be substantially to the disadvantage of those companies that are members of that industry organisation. That is a matter of some grave concern. They proposed some amendments to the committee which, on a quick reading, I cannot see that the government has picked up to try and deal with that particular issue.</para><para>The second and most damning submission that I have seen in respect of this was by Warren Pengilley. Dr Pengilley is the Sparke Helmore Professor of Commercial Law at the University of Newcastle. His paper was headed `The New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill introduced on 16 March 2000 should be scuttled. It is unconscionable.' Dr Pengilley goes on to argue that in fact what is being sought to be done cannot be done in respect of this bill. In fact, he argues that it is unconstitutional. He goes on to say at one particular point:</para><quote><para>The GST has been very controversial. It is hardly clear law. Public disagreement between various Ministers and the ACCC itself have been a feature of what it really means. Many people still do not know what the law is or how to comply with it. Freedom to give independent advice without fear of $500,000 if this advice is `wrong' (which may well mean, in this context, advice with which the ACCC does not agree), is the linchpin of business being able to know what the legislation means and what to do to comply with it.</para></quote><para>More importantly, he says `The ACCC should live by the same rules and not be misleading in its Guidelines.' Then he goes on to set out in a very comprehensive form the areas within the guidelines that he believes to be misleading.</para><para>It is also true that I note in respect of the bill that it seeks to impose penalties if a corporation in trade or commerce makes false or misleading comments on the likely effects of a GST. I notice that it did not include individuals and it did not include government ministers or politicians. If it had, and had prosecuted it, then you would have to say that the surplus would have been substantially more than it was in Tuesday night's budget, and a lot of that would have come from government ministers who had been out promoting the new tax system. Government ministers have been out there, trying to sell this dog's breakfast of a tax. The reality is that there are not going to beâand we all know itâsubstantial prosecutions as a result of the introduction of this bill, nor through the activities of the ACCC, because there are not the resources available to the ACCC to be able to carry out the management of the introduction of this new tax system in the way in which the government are seeking to portray that they will be able to do. </para><para>Its action here in terms of the role of the ACCC is simply to use the fear tactic to put a scare across a whole range of people involved in the business community that somehow or other, in the dead of night or early in the morning, somebody in a black robe with a black hat or a black bandanna on will come knocking on your door and say, `The price police are here. We want to have a look at your operations. We want to make sure you're not exploiting the application of the GSTâthat you're not making more than 10 per cent, that you haven't put your goods up by more than 10 per cent as a result of the introduction of the new tax,' without taking into account all the other factors that are associated with it which may in fact force prices up by more than 10 per cent, which has been admitted by Professor Fels himself. He said, `Don't do it in the initial stages, but you can do it over time. It's fine to recover your compliance costs over time, but just don't do it in the initial stages because it might embarrass this government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>14405</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to ask a question of the parliamentary secretary.

Again, isn't there a double jeopardy there: that the state can hit the corporations and then the Commonwealth can hit the corporations as well, so you have the situation where corporations are hit twice, even small businesspeople; whereas because of the fact that the Commonwealth cannot hit an individual, then the individual is subject to only one regime.

I think it goes for a period of two years during the implementation phase. We make no apology for the fact that we are bringing in a severe penalty regime for those people who might seek to use the GST and tax system changes to exploit consumers.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think people who are opposing what we are doing can have it both ways. You cannot say, `Look, Mr Fels doesn't really have enough power to stop prices going over 10 per cent, or he doesn't have any real power, or he doesn't have any power all,' and then literally in the same breathâor at least in the next breathâsay that these penalties are harsh. We know they are harsh. They are extremely harsh, because we want to give an assurance to the people that we are putting in place a tax system that will replace a whole range of existing embedded taxes, wholesale sales taxes, which have applied in this country for decades, that certainly cascade through the pricing of our products and particularly our exports. They apply at the wholesale level. If you are going about business and you have got to buy these wholesale goods to then make further goods or services you have already paid those taxes. If you are a hardware store, for example, you have got to pay the wholesale sales taxes at the wholesale level. You might have electric drills and wheelbarrows and all those sorts of things sitting on your shelves or in your shop for months and months, and you are funding that wholesale sales tax out of your overdraft.</para><para>We are bringing in a system that means that the small business person gets all of those taxes back. If they are paying GST on their petrol, they get all that back. So they are getting all of these cost reductions. We want to make sure that we are not only relying on the competitive forces that take place. The hardware area is a very good example, an incredibly competitive marketplace. I think all of us, whether we like the GST or not, would expect that, say, in the hardware sector or in the supermarket sector you will find competitive forces ensuring that the proprietors of those storesâbe they corporations or individualsâwill pass on all of the savings that accrue because of the abolition of Labor's wholesale sales taxes.</para><para>It will occur in the computer industry.

The government is proud of that. We are very keen to see Australia being a leading part of the information economy, a world leader in this area. We think reducing the price of computers and modems to get people online is an enormously sensible policy and increasing people's access to the computer age. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So we think, Senator Cooney, that competition in many respects will reduce prices, but we are not prepared to rely on that. We are bringing in a very strict, very powerful regime to ensure that if anyone seeks to exploit the implementation of the new tax systemâto not reduce their prices enough or raise prices too muchâthe government and the ACCC will come down on them like an absolute ton of bricks, with huge penalties and investigative powers. We make no apology for that. I am happy to go on any radio station or TV station around Australia and ensure that people understand that.</para><para>It is just a great shame that Labor were not able to give us enough cooperation to see this bill through the parliament today.

The bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy SurchargeâFringe Benefits) Act 1999 and provide for increases in the thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. For example, the threshold for individuals is to be increased from $13,389 to $13,550 and the threshold for couples with no children is to be increased from $22,594 to $22,865. As a result of the increases in the thresholds, the bill will also increase the upper level of shading-in of the Medicare levy for individuals.

They never listen. One of the astonishing things is that the Labor Party stand up and try to attack the GST in the chamber. It may come as a surprise to some of the public to know that the Labor Party have signed on to the GST. Mr Beazley has confirmed that the Labor Party will be going to the next election with the GST as part of their package. So an issue which we can easily debate after question time in relation to the good senator's question is: does he propose to change the current arrangements for strata titles? The senator is trying to make a political point and pretending to people that somehow the Labor Party have not signed on to this system lock, stock and barrel. They have. So we are going to listen. My colleague Senator Knowles is keeping a massive list on this issue of the areas for roll-back where Labor senators have stood up and queried aspects of the GST.

We heard that last time, Senator, and we happen to be over here and you are over there. In relation to the specifics of the question, individuals, partnerships, companies, trusts and other entities undertaking an enterprise are required to register in the GST system if their annual turnover is $50,000 or more. An entity with an annual turnover below this threshold does not have to register but can choose to registerâin fact, may well choose to register. If such an entity elects not to register, it does not have to charge GST on its supplies, and it will not be entitled to claim input credits. Whether owners of strata titled units rented out will be considered as carrying on an enterprise may well have to be determined on a case by case basis. The point of the matter is that the general principle for the registration level is $50,000. If the Labor Party has a different registration level, this is big news. Let me say to this chamber that, if the Labor Party proposes to change the registration level, this is big news.

At the outset there is very good news today for all Australians in the job figures. We have the unemployment rate falling to 6.8 per cent, both seasonally adjusted and trend figuresâwell on target for the 6Â¼ per cent unemployment that we predicted in our budget. That means there are some nine million Australians in employment. In fact, in the month of April some 37,000 Australians found jobs. </para></talk.start><para>But what is even more heartening is the situation in relation to teenage employment. We saw that teenage employment rose by 6,900, bringing the unemployment rate for teenagers to 21.5 per cent, which is the lowest youth unemployment rate since 1990; the lowest youth unemployment rate in 10 years. It is a far cry from the unemployment rates we saw under Labor: an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent compared with Labor's 11 per cent.</para><para>The question also related to training and opportunities for people in regional and rural Australia. For a start, we have committed $2 billion for the New Apprenticeship Scheme. We have over 250,000 people in training and, of course, included in that number are people in training in regional Australia. This is a far cry from 1996 when we came to government when there were 146,000 people in training. We have taken it to over a quarter of a million. And of that quarter of a million Australians in training, 70 per cent are younger than 24 years of age. That means there are training opportunities for young people in Australia and, of course, for young people in regional Australiaâa far cry from when we took over government from Labor when vocational training and apprenticeships were at an all-time low.  </para><para>We have also announced the extension of the youth allowance. We have announced that the discount on farm and business assets will be increased to 75 per cent, up from 50 per cent. This will give a greater opportunity for young Australians in regional Australia to access the youth allowance. Of course, under the new tax system the youth allowance goes up by four per centâa far cry from what it was under Labor. In fact, there were no opportunities under Labor for young Australians. What you saw were high unemployment rates for young Australians and no training opportunities. Today we have record numbers of young people in training. We also have a decrease in youth unemployment rates. </para><para>This spells good news for young Australians. It spells good news for all Australians. These unemployment figures did not happen by accident. They have been reduced by good fiscal management of the economy that provides jobs for Australians, especially young Australians. This budget is good news for all Australians, especially young ones and people in rural and regional Australia.

I think there is common ground in this parliament on the importance of science and innovation to Australia's future. As a government, we are delivering on our commitment to innovation in a number of innovative waysâthat is, the Innovation Investment Funds, the Commercialising Emerging Technologies program, R&amp;D Start and other such programs. We had the successful innovation summit in February, we have an innovation action agenda to be released later this year and the Chief Scientist is conducting a review of our total science capability.</para></talk.start><para>This year's budget continues to deliver assistance for innovation. This afternoon I will be tabling the science and innovation budget statement. That statement will show that total spending on science and innovation will increase by $167 million to a total of $4.5 billion, which is a real increase of 1.1 per cent following a real increase last year of 1.6 per cent. That $4.5 billion is a record level of expenditure on science and innovation for any federal government, higher than any amount ever spent under the Labor government. The highlight of this year's statement is a 14 per cent increase in the current financial year in the take-up of the R&amp;D tax concession. In this financial year, support through the tax concession will rise by some $68 million to $553 million, and next year it will increase by a further $47 million to $600 million. This means that business is investing an extra $500 million in R&amp;D this year. Total government support for IR&amp;D and innovation in the business sector will grow to about $850 million, a real increase of two per cent.</para><para>One of the real highlights of the budget is an additional $30 million for our biotechnology strategyâwhich provides a framework for this very important and significant new Australian industryâon top of the $250 million we supply annually for biotechnology research and the establishment last year of Biotechnology Australia. The record of this government in science and innovation is profound and one which we can all be proud of. What do we have from the other side? Tonight Mr Beazley will get up and give his reply to the budget, and no doubt he will rave on and on and on about the knowledge nation.

If he thinks he can win an election by running around talking about the knowledge nation, he is guaranteed to lose the next election. Tonight he may even repeat Mr McMullan's very hollow promise of a target for business expenditure on R&amp;D by 2010. The trouble is that we never hear from anyone on the other side any new policies on innovation. We just have all the usual empty rhetoric and no policies whatsoever. </para></talk.start></continue><para>It reminds us of the last election when the Labor Party set a target of five per cent unemployment, but there was not one policy to reduce unemployment. Their policy on R&amp;D is all over the place. Mr McMullan continually attacks the reduction in the tax concession, which Labor forced on us by their huge deficits, but they refuse to commit to increasing it. Mr Beazley actually had the gall to say only recently that, under Labor, the tax concession would be removed from traditional industries like mining and manufacturing. Then Mr Latham actually came out and said that the tax concession should go altogether. So the opposition have nothing but empty rhetoric on the knowledge nation and targetsâno idea of policies, no clear policies and different messages from every different spokesman.

The government has a proud record of creating the economic environment that enables families to function effectively for their own wellbeing and that of the community. As Senator Harradine has quite rightly pointed out, under the new family assistance arrangements, payments will be increased, taper rates will be reduced, the income test will be eased and the assets test will be abolished.

We announced that we proposed to introduce a Timor levy last year because we were concerned that the budget might otherwise be in deficit. When we discovered that it would not be, we quite properly, in conjunction with our obligations to the Australian people, up-front said that we would no longer pursue it. That of course has caused enormous angst in the Labor Party because they love taxes. They cannot understand how we could possibly have scrapped such a nice looking little tax, which no doubt would have served as a convenient fig leaf for the showering of confetti around all the interest groups over the next couple of years, and which it could have increased from time to time, like the Medicare levy.</para></talk.start><para>We understand that the Australian people do not like unnecessary taxes, and this one was quite unnecessary. But Mr Beazley expressed great surprise yesterday on ABC radio; he could not understand why this tax had been removed. Do you know what he said today? Talk about a hopeless recidivistâhe said, `You could have cut taxes a little less.' In other words, he thinks that we have overcompensated the Australian public. This is very serious stuff because the opposition have a very bad track record. They promised not to put up the Medicare levyâ12 months later, up she goes. What did they do with all those wholesale taxes they increased by $14 billion? There was not a cent of compensation. What did they do with all those things that were l-a-w law? They went out the window, thanks to the help of Mrs Kernot, of course. Just as important as that appalling track record is their vision statement. Their vision statement really consists of more taxes here, finding more revenue whenever we can and simply not wanting to rule out a whole new series of taxes.</para><para>On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program this year, we have had a couple of very serious single vehicle collisions. One of them involved a VW in terms of the ministerial hierarchy: you will remember that Mr Melham was run over by a Laurie!

Do you remember what happened when Mr Beazley went on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program? He was asked, `Do you absolutely rule out raising income tax cuts to pay for a GST rollback?' His answer, `Well ...' So Laurie said, `Because this will raise income tax.' Mr Beazley answered, `All ... what I will say is this, Laurie.' Laurie seems to be one of these security blankets you throw out. It is really a plea for mercy: `Leave me alone, Laurie, I'm Labor.' Laurie asked, `So ... you're not ruling out an increase in income tax?' Mr Beazley answered, `We ... look, Peter Costello has come out with that particular canard.' Laurie said, `He will get away with it, if it's a canard, won't he?' He did get away with it because it is not a canard. Mr Beazley on about 27 occasions in two days simply refused to rule out increased taxation. </para><para>That is the stark difference between the parties.

Senator Gibson's letter indicates that Senator Murphy has confirmed that he made such a disclosure. Senator Murphy, by letter dated 11 April 2000, has set out the circumstances of the disclosure.</para></talk.start><para>The resolution of the Senate of 20 June 1996, adopting recommendations of the Privileges Committee, requires committees to take certain steps in relation to unauthorised disclosures of committee evidence or documents.

It may be thought that there is no point in referring the matter to the Privileges Committee because there is nothing for the committee to inquire into, in that a senator has conceded that he made the unauthorised disclosure. The Senate may well consider, however, that the Privileges Committee should be called upon formally to find the fact and the circumstances of the unauthorised disclosure and to advise the Senate on what action, if any, should be taken. I therefore give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. It will be for the Senate to determine whether the referral should occur.

The issue that arose related to the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the operations of the Australian Taxation Office. What happened at the time was that we did take a lot of in camera evidence, and there were some reports in the media with regard to the arrest of one witness that actually appeared before the committee. The circumstances were that the journalist that I spoke to was writing a story which was inaccurate and would have reflected on a particular public officer in a very serious and incorrect way.

The purpose of referring the matter to the Privileges Committeeâin line with your ruling, Madam Presidentâwas so that the matter can be properly considered there. I understand why Senator Murray might want to put some things on the record at this point, but he will have an opportunity, and so will all others at that later stage.

This is not an isolated case. In my office we have had a number of questions on notice that have experienced the same sorts of delays as Senator Allison has raised. This is an important issue being raised in the Senate today, because it is interesting that generally the slowness of the response is related to the political sensitivity of the question. I think it is appalling that the minister has failed to respond to questions on notice and to questions asked at estimates. The delay has been months and months. The most classic example of this is the question that we asked on notice about surprise inspections of nursing homes. It took us months and months to get an answer to a question about whether or not surprise inspections had been carried out in nursing homes. Finally, the evidence came forward that in fact there had been no surprise inspections, contrary to what the minister had been saying in the House of Representatives.</para></talk.start><para>I want to put it on record that Senator Herron has in general been very good at assisting in trying to get answers. I also want to put it on record that in terms of the questions that I have pursued at estimates the department has indicated that on most occasions the answers have in fact been provided to the minister's office in reasonable time and have not been processed through the minister's office and delivered to senators. So the delay seems to be in the office of the Minister for Aged Careâor the Minister for Age, as she is sometimes known these days. It is a very serious problem. Although Senator Herron has to answer for it in this chamber, I think the delay is in the minister's officeâin Minister Bishop's reluctance to answer questions placed on notice or asked at estimates that highlight her inadequacies in the portfolio. That is not acceptable. I think we need to get a better response. I felt it important that I support Senator Allison's concerns because, as I know Senator Herron will vouch, I have had to raise with him on a number of occasions the lateness of responses given. We need to try to address that. We pursued this at estimates quite strongly, and I recommend that you look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, Senator Allison, in terms of the answers from the department about where the delays are and when they have returned questions to the minister's office. It makes interesting reading, and I think it highlights the problem. I therefore want to join Senator Allison in making my concerns known and in suggesting that we have to get a much better performance out of the Minister for Aged Care in responding to these questions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14424</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Evans and Senator Allison for their statements. I think it is important to note that there are reasons behind certain delays. By way of illustration, I know in my own portfolio that to produce an accurate answer to a questionâbecause the answers have to be accurate as they are on the public record and there can be no fudging of the responses to the questionsâthe detail has to be gone into very carefully. For example, in my portfolio, if a question is asked about a particular community organisation, it goes through the local regional council, then to the state office and finally to the national office. It then has to go through that chain while the veracity of the answer is checked before again going back through that chain. Ultimately the answer is then provided to the question. Often that process takes weeks, if not months. That is one reason for delay.</para></talk.start><para>The second reason for delay is that sometimes the detail required to answer questions is quite extensive and there are often a number of questions asked, so again that takes an inordinate amount of time. In many cases these questions affect different departments and different portfolios, so that is a further cause for delay. The final point I would make is that sometimes the number of questions directed to a particular portfolio results in a delay. I speak more particularly here of the health portfolio rather than the aged care portfolioâalthough aged care, as Senator Allison and Senator Evans recognise, has been under public scrutiny for most of this year, if not for a lot of last year. So I think there are reasons for this occurring. All ministers like to get these questions out of the way and responded to, because it is the entitlement of the opposition and the Australian public to get answers to those questions as expeditiously as possible. </para><para>In relation to the question that Senator Allison brought up, one of the reasons that I was unable to bring the answer forward to the Senate this afternoonâand as I understand it, Senator Allison kindly faxed a copy of this particular question to the minister's office asking if she could have an answer to it and pointing out that an answer had been months in forthcomingâis that the minister and the department did not have time to produce it by this afternoon, but they will address the question as expeditiously as possible. That is why I responded in the way that I did. I will get back to the Senate as soon as the minister can provide that answer.</para><para>I accept finally that the opposition should look at the mote in their own eye.

The budget surplus, as we know, is phoney enough when based upon the sale of licences related to the use of thin air, when only a month ago the government refused to disclose figures for non-asset sales on the grounds that it might affect auction results if indicative figures were disclosed.</para><para>To avoid criticism of that backdown, the Treasurer deliberately and with malevolence attacked a leading telco capitalised at $50 billion or $60 billion on the Australian Stock Exchange. This attack comes in the public knowledge that the government has partially privatised Telstra on two occasions and has given an undertaking to further privatise Telstra only after a full public inquiry into service levels. In that context, the Australian Treasurer attacked Telstra by shooting off some comments about Telstra's dividend payout capacity and next year's expected dividends. Immediately, the markets reacted by slashing capitalisation by $1 billion and more than $500 million each from the government share and that of private sector interests.</para><para>Look at what the budget papers say on this issue. The budget papers refer to lower Commonwealth dividend receipts from some government business enterprises and lower dividends from the Reserve Bankânothing else. There is no specific mention of Telstra, no oblique reference to Telstra and no implied criticism of Telstra. In fact, it is clear that the Treasurer and the government have had knowledge of advanced dividends and special dividend payments because it has been in previous budget papers and on the public record for the last 2Â½ years.</para><para>The Treasurer, behaving grossly unfairly in attempting to distract attention from his phoney spectrum sale surplus by attacking Telstra, then refuses to take calls from Telstra executives, ostensibly on the grounds it would be pre-budget comment. The Treasurer refuses to talk to Telstra and encourages the market to wreck and lower the price of an asset owned by some two million Australians. In the final analysis, the Treasurer attacks Telstra, harms the assets of two million Australians and reduces the value of long-term investments held by institutions, both domestic and foreign. Telstra has to defend its own company in the marketplace by going public. Telstra denies it delivered any bad news at all to the government. It was Mr Costello who told reporters that Telstra had delivered `very bad news' on future dividend payments. What was Telstra's public response? Telstra said, and I quote the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>:</para><quote><para>[His comments] were not helpful from the perspective they could be construed that the company was performing badly ... We didn't give Costello bad news at all.</para></quote><para>So there we have the facts in full. We have a phoney budget surplus from the Treasurer. We have an attack by the press, who understood this immediately, on the government. The strategy of the Treasurer is to deflect the tension by creating an alternative news story. That alternative story misrepresents the facts and harms the government asset and two million Australians. Telstra immediately attempts to gain a retraction. The Treasurer, for reasons unknown, refuses to take the calls from the relevant executives of Telstra. Telstra then denies giving any bad news to the government. What a weird and wonderful exercise we have been subject to this week for no apparent reason. We have a real sale, in due course, giving us a current phoney budget, the government gets attacked on that and the Treasurer, to deflect this criticism from his own actions, makes up the story that Telstra has given him bad news. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>14427</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am a bit disappointed.

The facts are that Mr Costello acted with absolute propriety at all stages, had no inside information and did not accuse Telstra of anything at all. The suggestion is that somehow something that was said caused him to wreck the market price of Telstra. If you look at what happened yesterday, the share price of Telstra fell 9câit has fallen for seven consecutive daysâthe share price of Optus fell 35c and Hutchison went down 38c. Are you going to blame the Treasurer for that? Of course not. It is an absolute nonsense. So let us look at the facts. The Treasurer's comments that the Commonwealth dividend would be lower for the financial year ending 2001 are attributable to the fact that no special dividend has been planned for the next financial year, and the Commonwealth shareholding has decreased from 66.6 per cent to 50.1 per centâand we all know why that is and why it ought to go further. Mr Costello, with the responsibility to maximise non-tax revenue, was simply pointing out that he was disappointed that he would not get as much money as he would like from the RBA and Telstra. Fortunately, we have what you choose to characterise as `thin air' revenue.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âI know where you get that term from.

But just to be perfectly clear, as far as Mr Stanhope is concerned, my understanding is that no attempt was made to contact the Treasurer.

Other Telstra executives understood the facts of life. You want to wilfully misrepresent those facts. The facts are that he was simply expressing understandable disappointment that we were not going to get the special dividend this year.

A couple of years ago he was over in the US and had his first briefing with Dr Greenspan, one of the most influential and powerful bankers in the world. What did Mr Costello do?

Telstra are suffering because of this government's attempts to cover up and mislead ordinary Australians about the state of the budget. This is a government that has been prepared to engage in shonky accounting practices to try to pretend it is still in surplus and to try to cover up for the fact that this budget is in deficit, and the government knows it. While government senators on the other side sit there laughing, they are supporting a man that is prepared to do anything he needs to do to cover for his own embarrassment. </para><para>The Treasurer was caught out when the PM leaked the Timor story and he was lamenting on the radio: `I just wish it had still been a story we could have used, because it would have surprised and been sexy for the markets.' Who leaked it to cover it up? He is pointing the finger at the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister that has left the Treasurer with no clothes on budget night. What does the Treasurer do to try to cover for that? He trashes the Telstra stock price, which is worth a billion dollars to ordinary Australian mums and dads. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>14429</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Senator Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian people certainly know from bitter experience two things about Labor: firstly, you cannot trust them with the nation's finances; and, secondly, you cannot trust Labor on tax.

It is not being sold; it is being licensed. Through that licence, it will provide a source of revenue to the government which in effect is a repeatable source of revenue because the licence goes only for a certain number of years and then the licence has to be renewed and the licence fee is paid again. So this is a repeatable source of revenue for years into the future. Under proper accounting principles, as has been well established by the Treasurer, it should be part of the budget revenue and go into the budget bottom line.</para><para>We need only compare that with the way in which the Labor Party in government treated other items which certainly should not have gone into the bottom line of the budget. I refer particularly to their sale of assets as distinct from their licensing of radio spectrum. They put the proceeds of the sale of those assets, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, into the budget bottom line and then proceeded to spend what they gained from the sale of those assets in that particular budget in the year of receipt of the funds. What happened was that, once spent, that capital was gone forever and the next year, to keep up that level of spending, the Labor government had to borrow extensively. That is why we saw, in Labor's period in office, the government's indebtedness go from $16 billion to $96 billion. There was an increase of $80 billion in the debt during the life of the Labor government, purely because they did not understand financial management and proper accounting principles and, therefore, they treated receipts from assets as annual revenue rather than as a capital item. They did not use it to pay off the debt. In fact, they used it as annual revenue and, as a result of that, we had this massive increase in debt during the life of the Labor government. Of course, most of it was wasted spending which did not generate any benefit for the Australian community. </para><para>As I said, in contrast to that, the radio spectrum is a renewable source of revenue. Of this government's activities with regard to the sale of assets, I will cite the issue of Telstra. All of the money from Telstra has been used for capital purposes, principally to pay off a large swag of that massive debt inherited from the Labor government but also for the capital purpose of rehabilitating our environment. So that is quite a dramatic contrast between this government and the Labor governmentâthat is, the sale of assets as distinct from licensing of radio spectrum.</para><para>The other attack we heard from the two senators this afternoon was with regard to the damage to Telstra that they allege had been done because of comments by the Treasurer. As Minister Alston showed a few moments ago, the decline in Telstra's price has been consistent in recent daysâit was not simply as a consequence of a one-off comment by the Treasurerâand it also is consistent with the fall in price of other telecommunications service providers over the same period, such as Optus.</para><para>Anyone who knows the situation with regard to Telstra knows that the major damage that is being done to Telstra is again being done by the Labor opposition because of their refusal to accept the full privatisation of Telstra and their refusal to allow the Australian people to have direct ownership of the remaining 50.1 per cent of Telstra which would benefit Telstra's future and the future of all Australians.

I bet Dr Greenspan was somewhat sorry that happened afterwards, because, when the Treasurer came out of the meeting, he blurted all the sensitive private information that was given to him, and that caused all sorts of problems. In fact, he did the same yesterday. Just so there is no argument about this, I want to quote exactly what the Treasurer said.

I am waiting for the writs to turn up to all of those reporters who wrote this stuff in the media, because this looks straight up and down here. Obviously Mr Costello must not have said it. If he did not say it, why aren't the writs being served? We all know that Mr Costello did say it. We have plenty of witnesses to the fact that he did say it.</para><para>The other issue that has come up here this afternoon is about Telstra. We have been told that Telstra basically oscillated between certain states, one of which was incompetent managementâand that is the real reason why the shares are going down. We had Senator Alston here making some comments about Telstra management. I would say to Senator Alston that he also should not go outside and say that.

In order to combat people smuggling, there is a high degree of international, inter-agency cooperation and information sharing.

As Senator Faulkner made clear today, and as Senator Herron was not able to understand, this was a report commissioned by Minister Wooldridge, the minister for health, in response to the growing pressure about his failure to properly investigate the circumstances surrounding the 1998 budget decision to extend Medicare rebates to these magnetic resonance imaging machines. The pressure had been brought about by the Labor opposition pursuing concerns raised by members of the profession, members of the public and others involved that there had been a leak in the budget decision and that certain radiologists and other associated persons had gained a commercial advantage and had purchased MRI machines because they knew that the budget would announce Medicare rebates for the use of those machines.</para><para>The implication was not just that there was a commercial advantage to those radiologists but that the Commonwealth taxpayer would be liable because the budget decision stated that all machines on order prior to budget night would be eligible for Medicare rebates. That meant that up to $1Â½ million of taxpayers' funds would be available to support the cost of those MRI machines that were subject to the budget decision. So there was a huge advantage in people getting in on the budget decision. If you got your MRI machine as one of those approved on budget night as being on order or in use before then, you were eligible for up to $1Â½ million a year but, if you missed out, you did not get any of those rebates. From a commercial point of view, you obviously wanted to be in the know, you wanted to make sure that your machine, or any machine you were hoping to order, was in fact eligible for Medicare rebates.</para><para>The fact isâand the Auditor-General's report proves thisâa number of people knew. They knew that the 12 May budget would contain a budget decision to extend Medicare rebates not only to the existing private machines but also to all machines on order. That is why in the four working days leading up to the budget 33 MRI machines were ordered. You might say, `What's 33?' These machines cost $3 million. These are $3 million purchases. So, for people to go out and decide to buy 33 of them, they are making a huge financial commitment. The only way you would make that sort of commitment in those sorts of numbers, given that in the previous 20 years we had only had 50 or so come into country, is because you knew you would be eligible for Medicare rebates.</para><para>So 33 orders went in in the four working days leading up to the budget. It just so happens that those four working days followed a meeting that the minister had on 6 May with the College of Radiologists. There was not much activity before 6 May but, after 6 May, everybody got in for their chop, everybody knew. The minister has for two years denied that there was any leak. He has flatly denied it. He changed his defence when the Auditor-General's report came out. He has been singing a different tune in the last couple of days. He has ridiculed the opposition for suggesting there was a leak. He has described it as preposterous that there was any such leak. The Auditor-General does not see it that way. The Auditor-General says there was a leak. The Auditor-General says that, as a result of that meeting, people knew what was in the budget. If you want further proof, look at their activity. They went out and bought big because they knew of the budget decision. </para><para>In the last few days Senator Knowles, the minister and others have grabbed onto the one or two lines in the Auditor-General's report that they think might be the best defence against the charge. But the reality is that the conclusions of the report, the totality of the report, the whole context of the report, say that something happened on 6 May when the minister met the radiologists that led them to make those huge financial decisions. They told their mates and they all got in to take advantage of the budget decision. They did not order them the day after the budget; they ordered them in the four days between meeting with the minister and the budget decision. The minister was in denial for two years about this.</para><para>Let us look at the behaviour of the parties. First of all, if you examine the radiologists' behaviour, they went out and bought. To me, that implies they knew something, and that is confirmed by the Auditor-General's report. Let us look at the minister's behaviour. He went into denial. He refused to accept there was a problem for two years. It was not until October 1999 that he finally took the rebate off them. By then, even he had to accept that there had been a massive fraud on the Commonwealth, that the Commonwealth was losing money hand over fist for machines that he did not want.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name></talker><para>âHow many wrong MRIs have been done?

He did not take action to remove the rebate until October 1999. Even I figured it out and asked the question in February, `Surely, if all these machines are coming in over and above what you planned and the whole thing is obviously out of control, why don't you take the rebate away?' You did not have to be a genius to figure it out, but he refused. He held off and held off, hoping that the problem would go away, refusing to accept that the problem existed. But, in October 1999, even he had to admit the bleeding of the Commonwealth taxpayer had to be stemmed and he removed the rebate. These machines are no longer eligible for Medicare rebates because he knew the scam had been perpetrated on the Commonwealth. But until yesterday he denied there was a leak.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you look at the reaction of the department, you get further indication of what occurred. The department did not have an investigation into the budget leak. They did not bother to find out whether or not there had been a leak. They took no steps to investigate the concerns that were raised with them, by members of the profession and by members of the public who wrote to them, who phoned them, who raised complaints, who alerted the opposition. There was no budget leak investigation. I know that in other departments, if a minor indiscretion occursâsomeone using email improperly or somethingâthe tracker dogs are called in, the police are called in, telephones are tapped, major investigations occur. We have a major fraud on the Commonwealth and the department did not institute a proper investigation into the leaks. Why? Because they knew who leaked it. You cannot have an investigation into your own minister. You cannot investigate your own minister because he is your boss. They knew who leaked it. They know who was at the 6 May meeting. It was the minister, one bureaucratâMs Penny Rogersâand a former staffer of the minister. They know who was at the meeting, so they knew who had to leak it because he was the only one there. They only got the tick off on 5 May. That is when they finally knew they had the tick off, that the deal could be done. </para><para>Yesterday, after seeking this information for months and months and getting a return to order passed by the Senate, we finally got the other key document. The Auditor-General's report is one key document. The other key document is the only written record of the negotiations taking place with the radiologists. Minister Herron finally came clean with the key document yesterday. We have been after this with a return to order of the Senate since October. They would not hand it over. They used every public privilege defence known to mankind and some they made up to try to deny us getting this information. But when they knew bad news day hit yesterday, suddenly the documents were available. The minister said, `We might as well get it all out on one day, so I will make them available.' This is the bloke who released the first report on Christmas Eve, who released the second report at 5 p.m. on Thursday before Good Friday and who releases this one on the day after the budget. It seems to me that the minister did not want us to know. He did not want the public to know what was going on. The trifecta of release dates shows you that the minister has been involved in a cover-up to prevent the public knowing what has happened. The document we got yesterday in addition to the Auditor-General's report is very interesting. </para><para>The department negotiated for months with the radiologists about a very important budget measureâabout the supply of radiological services and about capping those services and it was a major initiative of the minister to put it into the budget. There is not a file note about it. You cannot find one file note about it. The department did not keep any records. Here you have the Department of Health and Aged Care, one of the major departments of the Commonwealth bureaucracy, and they did not keep a note. There is not a file note, there is not a minute, there is not a scrap of paperâthere is nothing. Funny, isn't it? Here you have a bureaucracy who are known for generating paperâanyone who applies for a benefit from Centrelink gets deluged with paperâbut, no, the department have not got a file note about these meetings. They had meetings where they negotiated with the College of Radiologists month after monthânot one minute kept. You wonder how they finally got to a final document. It must have just come out of thin air because there is not one file note. There is not one piece of evidence. </para><para>But yesterday they finally came up with one piece of paper that reflected these months of negotiations about an important budget measure and that was a note to the minister and his advisers about the direction for a meeting with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists on 6 May. It is a very important document. It lists the participants. The purpose of the meeting was to finalise the negotiations. This was a deal between the radiologists and the government. They gave something; they got something. The deal was that the radiologists agreed to a cap on the services and in return the minister would provide Medicare rebatesâa very sensitive negotiation, a bit of give and take. But the key to the supply side measure was how many machines would be eligible for Medicare rebates. The minister would have us believe that the radiologists signed up to this deal after months of negotiations not knowing what the government was going to deliver. They had been negotiating for months. The minister went along to a meeting which he said was to shake hands on the deal. He admits it was to finalise the deal. He is on the record as saying that it was to finalise the deal. So they went along to the meeting. But his defence is: `Yes, we finalised the deal, but I didn't tell them what our side of the bargain was. I didn't tell them that.'  </para><para>I do not know how naive or stupid people are supposed to think the radiologists are, but I do not know of negotiations where when you finalise a deal one party is not told what they get out of the deal and you do not actually sign off on both sides of the agreement. The minister would have us believe, in his defence, that the radiologists signed up to their side of the bargain and he did not tell them his, he did not tell them what they were going to get back in return. These radiologists are jolly good chaps, aren't they? They are jolly good chaps. They sign up to this, agreeing to cap their potential income not knowing what the minister is going to do in terms of the Medicare rebate system, not knowing whether the machines they have on order are eligible for Medicare rebates. What jolly good chaps! Well, I do not believe it for a minute. I believe that the minister went along, as his note says, as his own evidence says, to finalise the deal. And when you finalise the deal and shake hands on the deal, as he says, you agree on what the terms of that deal are. You might not have all the detail, but you agree on the basic terms. </para><para>The basic term that the minister delivered was that all machines on order up to budget night would be eligible for Medicare rebates. That is what they were told. That was what they signed off on. That was the deal. And the notes for this meeting, which were given to the minister and his advisers, make that very clear. The minister's job was to explain to them where things are in the budget context. The notes state:</para><quote><para>Budget night is 12 May (less than a week away).</para><para>You and the Department have been working on selling the proposals to the PM, Minister for Finance and the Treasurer over the last week or so.</para></quote><para>Thereby acknowledging that the minister already knew about this and had been selling it to the powers that be. The note goes on to say that there are some problems and it talks about budget papers having already been finalised. An interesting aside is that the notes say:</para><quote><para>Some believe that the MBS is very open-ended and that putting MRI on it is a high risk strategy. </para></quote><para>Well, it was a high risk strategy and it failed. And those who advised the minister at that time obviously were right and he was dead wrong. They go on to say:</para><quote><para>It wasn't just a matter of giving the proposals a tick. </para></quote><para>This is a note to the minister about what to say to the radiologists:</para><quote><para>You are optimistic about getting it agreed to. </para></quote><para>His instruction from the department was to say to them, `You are optimistic about getting it agreed to.' In other words, `I've got the tick for the budget agreement.' The notes go on to say:</para><quote><para>DOFA has included in the Budget papers their own indicative costings and savings for the package and it is now too late to change them. </para></quote><para>He had this problem that the budget papers had already been finalised. But his instruction from the department was to tell the radiologists that he was optimistic about getting the deal agreed to. They go on to say:</para><quote><para>Recognise they have acted in good faith and you want to reciprocate. </para></quote><para>So the minister was asked to act in good faith as well and to reciprocate and provide them with information. The notes further state:</para><quote><para>There will need to be some âhousekeepingâ post Budget to get things in order and to reflect the proposals as agreed. </para></quote><para>The whole tenor of these notes is that the minister was sent along to give it the tick. He was advised, `You cannot tell them exactly, but you are optimistic about getting it agreed to. We'll have to sort out the details afterwards, but we are signing on the deal.' The other interesting note at the endâand this is perhaps gratuitousâsays:</para><quote><para>Highlight to them that they are a model for others in the medical profession. </para></quote><para>So the minister would have highlighted to them at the meeting that they are, as far as he was concerned, the model for others in the medical profession. I gather he is a bit chastened now because they went out and bought 33 machines at $3 million a piece and rorted the Commonwealth. So I suspect he does not consider them the model any longer, or if he does think them a model I think it is a model of something else. </para><para>As a result of this meeting they went out and bought their MRI machines, because the deal was done and the handshake was given. The notes given to the minister to take to that meeting tell him to do that: to finalise the deal, to shake on it and to tell them that he was optimistic about getting it agreed toâthat is, the budget measure. We now know that that happened. The Auditor-General says, `We know that, as a result of that meeting, the leak occurred, people deduced that it was on, and they went out and ordered machines.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name></talker><para>âIn what paragraph does it say there was a leak?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âSenator Knowles, you can claim all the misrepresentations that you like. Anybody who reads this report gets the same impression. All the media commentators have heard your defence and they do not believe it. It is a nonsense. It says that there was a meeting on 6 May and, as a result of that, people were in the know about the budget measure and the fraud was made. I am not saying that necessarily Dr Wooldridge deliberately went out to cause a problem for the Commonwealth, but he has to accept responsibility for what occurred. He is the minister for health. He initiated this. We know it was his baby. He went along to sign up to it and to shake hands with the radiologists to do the deal. He was personally responsible for this. The fact that the department does not have a minute or any knowledge, it seems, of the detail about this is further indication that this was run by the minister. He went along to the meeting with only one departmental official to sign up to the deal. And they did sign up to it. As a result, there was a massive fraud on the Commonwealth and the whole measure was a complete failure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I see today and last night that the minister has been saying what a great success it was. I do not know when he decided to run this line, but I guess if you want to tell a lie, you tell a big lie. There is no way that anyone could describe this as a big success. I understandthere are about 19 radiologists waiting to appear in the courts. The government itself has admitted its failure by removing the rebate from most of the machines. There is no way that this has been anything other than a giant scam. It is a scam on the taxpayers of Australia, and the minister must wear the responsibility. I know this government has no idea about ministerial responsibility, but what do you have to do for a minister to say, `I take responsibility'? He went to the meeting; it was his baby; he shook hands; and he told them, `I am very optimistic about this getting agreed to in the budget. I have explained to you about the budget papers. It will all be okay: the deal is done and the machines are on order.'</para><para>That is what happened. That is what the Auditor-General's report leads you to conclude. That is what the one document we have been able to get out of the department says to you. I know they have very low standards in this government. Minister Bishop is allowed to continue in Aged Care; it seems Dr Wooldridge will be allowed to continue in Health. At what stage do we get some ministerial accountability from this government? At what stage do ministers say, `I was responsible for this. I will take the responsibility'? Last night Dr Wooldridge said that his responsibility was to make sure that it would never happen again. That is the extent of his ministerial responsibility. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14442</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âGee whiz, if I was Dr Wooldridge, wouldn't I be worried! Being attacked by Senator Evans and Ms Macklin in the House of Representatives equates to being hit across the back of the hand with a wet lettuce leaf soaked in hot baby oil. It is just breathtaking to think that there can be allegations such as those that have been made by Senator Evans here todayâand made by others of course during question time today and yesterday, and of course those being made in the other placeâthat this Auditor-General's report somehow says that Minister Wooldridge leaked budget documents. That is completely and utterly intentionally wrong. I challenged Senator Evans right the way through his contribution to direct me to the paragraph contained in the Auditor-General's report where the Auditor-General says that the minister was responsible for leaking that information. He was unable to do so; Ms Macklin has been unable to do so; and Senator Faulkner has been unable to do so. There has not been one person in the Labor Party who has been able to identify where the Auditor-General has made such a claim. </para></talk.start><para>That has not stopped the Labor Party misrepresenting not only the Auditor-General but the minister's role in this whole exercise. That has not also stopped the Labor Party from just going on and on about it. Senator Evans made the comment that Minister Wooldridge said that there was no leak and that now he has changed his tune. He has done nothing of the sort because, quite franklyâwhile Senator Evans cannot refer to a paragraph in the Auditor-General's report that substantiates his claim that the Auditor-General has said the minister leaked budget informationâI, unlike Senator Evans, can refer to the part of the Auditor-General's report where he says quite the reverse. In paragraph 2.27 on page 84, the Auditor-General says:</para><quote><para>All college members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agreeâ</para></quote><para>and, I might add there, under oath, unlike Senator Evansâ</para><motion><para>that the minister did not reveal budget measures.</para></motion><para>So I can refer to that, but Senator Evans cannot make a reference to his allegation. Furthermore, in paragraph 2.23 the Auditor-General goes on to say:</para><quote><para>There were no informal discussions between the minister and college representatives on the MRI proposal. Further, there is no evidence that the minister had any discussions between 6 May and budget day with any parties outside government with respect to MRI supply measures.</para></quote><para>Yet Senator Evans has the audacity to come in here and continually state that this report claims that the minister is guilty of leaks. That is completely and utterly wrong.</para><para>I want to cover what has actually happened in this area, because that is particularly important. It is something that Senator Evans wanted to dismiss. He said, `The government has claimed that the whole process was a big success, but who cares about this? This is not about a success. This is about what ministerial responsibility should be.' Well, I am sorry; but the government does care whether these policies are successful or not. I want to make sure that the public knows what the success of the policy has been, because the fact of the matter is that, when we took over government after 13 years of Labor neglect, the situation with MRI was nothing short of a disgrace.</para><para>And what has been delivered since? The minister has delivered access to MRI services. The Labor Party had five months wait. You know what that has been reduced to? Two weeks or less. In fact, one of their own, Graham Richardson, a former Labor senator, said today on radio that he was very pleased with the policy because he needs to have a scan and he is very pleased that he can get access to it. Under the former government, the Labor government, he would have had to wait five or six months for it. But not only that: Minister Wooldridge has reduced the out-of-pocket costs from $600 to $700 under Labor to between $40 and $50. I reckon that is pretty advantageous to the public, but Senator Evans does not think so.</para><para>Of course, the other most important factor about all of this is that it has improved distribution so that people do not have to travel so far to receive these services. Under Labor, there were 18 publicly funded unitsâ18; that is it. How many are there now, under Minister Wooldridge? Sixty-six. How many in the country under Labor? None. How many now in the country under Minister Wooldridge? Seventeen. I think that is a pretty important leap forward in terms of accessibility. It means that people who are experiencing serious health difficulties can be referred by their specialists to have access to the best technology available to diagnose their condition. MRI is considered and recognised as the best diagnostic technology for myriad conditions.</para><para>Now I ask a rhetorical question. How many patients has Senator Evans or Ms Macklin or Senator Faulkner, or Senator Crowley for that matter, seen with medical conditions requiring MRI? I would go so far as to answer that question by saying none; not one. By contrast, Dr Wooldridge, a medical practitioner, understands and recognises the need for MRI as a very important diagnostic tool. The MRI technology itself exceeds all other technology for diagnosing conditions of the central nervous system, and they can include life-threatening conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis and serious infection. Information from MRI scans is critical to planning medical intervention and other types of treatment, such as radiotherapy. It has an important role in the imaging of the musculo-skeletal system, and it is essential for planning treatment for tumours arising in bone or soft tissue. It can reduce the need for arthroscopes in the diagnosis of joint disease. It has an important role in imaging the cardiovascular system and can reduce the need for invasive angiographic tests. </para><para>I put the proposition that, if one of Senator Evans's children had a serious neurological condition where the doctor considered that an MRI was essential to diagnose that for early intervention, would he prefer to wait five months for his child to have an MRI or would he prefer to get the child in within a matter of days? I would certainly think, knowing what a family man Senator Evans is, that he would prefer to have his child diagnosed immediately.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âI rise on a point of order.

You just keep on doing it. You know there is no point of order. Start learning your standing orders, for heaven's sake! The fact of the matter is this: was there a leak? That is the important question. The opposition continue to scream for the minister's head, despite the Auditor-General's report. It would be interesting to see if someone like Senator Lundy, who prides herself on being so particular, can actually refer to where in the Auditor-General's report it says there was a leak. No other colleague has been able to do it on the Labor side, and so it will be interesting to see whether Senator Lundy or any of her other colleagues can. The reports states that `no substantive conclusion can be drawn in the light of contradictory evidence'. In particular, the Auditor-General found that `all participants agree that the Minister did not discuss what measures would be in the budget'. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I have referred to it before. The minister referred to it at question time. I have referred to it again. But I will bet London to a brickâI wish I was as sure of winning Lotto on Saturday nightâthat the opposition will refer to it again as a leak coming out of the Auditor-General's report. There is no such reference in the Auditor-General's report. Further, the Auditor-General reports:</para><quote><para>All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May agreed that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures.</para></quote><para>So there are two references. Not oneâtwo references. But not satisfied with the Auditor-General's conclusion, the opposition point to the number of machines which were ordered after his meeting with representatives of the College of Radiologists.</para><para>Nineteen units have been referred to the DPP and another eight are subject to civil action. The minister has not denied that. That has been said in the estimates committee meetings. I have chaired those meetings. I am very much aware of what has happened in those meetings. It has never been denied. But what I do ask the opposition to prove is: how many tests that have been conducted have been proven to be unnecessary, remembering that every test that is done is basically audited by the HRC? I will give them the answer because I know that they will continue to say that millions of dollars of taxpayers' money has been wasted on this. That is all very well. It is not them who have had the test done. There has not been one test that has been proven to be unnecessary in a complete audit. Therefore, let the opposition tell me: where has the wastage occurred? Where has the taxpayers' money been wasted, when not one test that has been done has been proven to be unnecessary? Once again I challenge them to say, `That's good enough for everybody else, but is it good enough for me?' They do not want anyone to refer to them. They do not want anyone to refer to their families. Okay, that is fine. But, gee whiz, I am glad that I am on our side of the fence in terms of consideration of families if that be the case. Interestingly also, we are absolutely swamped by trade unionists over on the other side who have very little experience in business. I can tell you that blind Freddy would see in terms of the radiologists thatâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>âYou are pathetic, Knowles.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âI beg your pardon? That is good. I am interested to get that interjection because I will be really interested to get your response. As a trade unionist who has no business experience it will be interesting to get your response and understanding of the way business works. Blind Freddy as a radiologist would be able to see a number of a issues changing and a number of things happening. A number of the meetings that were referred to in the Auditor-General's report, which once again conveniently happened to be overlooked by the opposition, show that these meetings held with the task force in its negotiation with the department in late March and early and late Aprilâ25 March, 25 March again, 14 April and 23 Aprilâwere all done well before the alleged leak of the one and only meeting with Minister Wooldridge.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Therefore, if you were a radiologist, wouldn't you think, `Mmm, there might be a chance of a budget decision coming out in May whereby, if I have a machine on order I am going to qualify for something'? That is a business decision. But not only was that decision made; it was acted upon by a number of people, and unusually it was acted upon in such a way that they could place an order and not suffer a penalty if they cancelled the order. When I was in businessâmy business sold equipmentâmost orders were binding and therefore you were held responsible and needed to pay for the equipment once you had ordered it. In this situation they were cute enough, in some instances, to put in an order that could be withdrawn and not paid for. But somehow or other the opposition are desperate enough to attack Minister Wooldridge and say that he is somehow responsible for that. These meetings were held before his meeting, and there are so many references to it in the Auditor-General's report that they somehow cannot read or choose not to read. In other words, why wouldn't some radiologists take a punt on ordering them? They do not understand that that is part of the speculation. But, interestingly enough, the Auditor-General recognised what the opposition cannot. In paragraph 2.32, the Auditor-General said: </para><quote><para>However, when considered alongside the differing recollections of what happened at Task Force meetings, it is a reasonable judgment that negotiation and consultation with the College and open debate about supply controls probably created an environment where some participants may have deduced, or become aware, that the Commonwealth was giving consideration to inclusion of machines on order.</para></quote><para>Golly gosh. The Auditor-General can figure that out but the opposition cannot. The Auditor-General can put it in his report, but the opposition cannot read it. So here we go. We are still saying, `The minister leaked.' The interesting thing is that the minister's responsibility has been absolutely and utterly proper. But I will tell you what the minister is not responsible for: that is, the questionable activities of some of the radiologists and the suppliers of MRI machines. I would have thought those opposite would have been bright enough to understand that, but clearly they cannot make that distinction.</para><para>The minister entered into these deliberations with radiologists on behalf of the government to improve access to MRI services for all Australians in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. That is of no consequence to the oppositionâno consequence at all. That does not matter. As Senator Evans said, `What has happened is irrelevant. The outcome of the policy does not matter.' Shame, it does not matter to him, but it matters to most Australians.</para><para>The other thing is, if you had to backdate an order, how would you have a leak? If you had a leak why would you need to backdate the order? But the opposition cannot answer that question either. If you had to enter into a conditional contract, why would you have had a leak? I would not enter into a conditional contract if I knew something were fact; I would sign on the dotted line and say, `Right, let's go ahead.' But no, they entered into conditional contracts. And, as I say, this has not been an additional cost to taxpayers in terms of any unnecessary tests being conducted. I want the opposition to prove where, when and why any unnecessary tests have been conducted, because the HIC is unable to do so. The opposition has no information on that at all, but they do not seem to worry about that.</para><para>The minister, of course, is not responsible for the questionable practices of some parts of the radiology profession. The DPP will deal with those who have acted illegally, and that is right and proper. But no, here we have this petty, stupid, irresponsible campaign to pursue a minister who has done more for the health policies for Australians in this country thanâI would go so far as to sayâany previous Commonwealth minister in our time. He has served for six years to make sure there is better accessibility for health services right across the country. The Labor Party just looked after Medicare. That was it. That was their sole aim: look after Medicareâblow the people in the bush; do not worry about the best diagnostic tools available and known; do not make them accessible; do not make them cost-effective; let us charge $500 or $600 for an MRI test, instead of $40 or $50; let us make people wait five months, instead of a couple of days. And that is all they worry about. This petty pursuit of the minister completely overlooks responsible public policy, and I think it is about time they put aside this pettiness and congratulated Minister Wooldridge for having the right policy for the people of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14446</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Senator John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAll I can say is that this is not a petty pursuit of the minister. I am indebted to Senator Knowles, because Senator Knowles used a phrase that I have not have heard used for a while. She was prepared to `bet London to a brick' on something. That was an old saying of Ken Howard, a very well known race caller in the sixties and seventies. But Ken Howard also had other sayings: `Never back odds-on,' and `Never run up steps.' Since we have got into the horsy analogy and are getting away from the families, I think it is worth while to just look at this whole affair and the not dissimilar parallels that can be drawn between the MRI scam and another famous scam that occurred in this country, namely that surrounding a horse called Fine Cotton. You might ask, `What is the relevance?' There are a number of parallels well worth looking at. </para></talk.start><para>If you go to the Fine Cotton affair, which happened back on 19 August 1984, you would find that Fine Cottonâa horse that had run 10th out of 12 at its previous start, had no form on the board at allâwas miraculously backed in from 33-1 to 7-2. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, it became pretty obvious that Fine Cotton was some sort of certainty, that something had happened in the space of less than one start to give people a degree of faith in this horse winning that particular event on that day. As it turned out, everyone knew that the fix was on. The only people who did not know that the fix was on were the stewards watching the race. So as Fine Cotton entered the straightâleading, as I understand itâon that day everyone across Australia who had backed it who knew that the fix was on was cheering, and those who had not backed it and knew that the fix was on were calling out loudly, `Fix, fix, fix.' The net result of that wasâI understand a little bit of paint came off Fine Cotton down the straightâthat they questioned the dramatic improvement and finally the horse was disqualified.</para><para>In that instance it looked like the fix, it smelled like a fix, and it was clearly a fix. You did not have to be there, you did not have to get the inside information, to know that it was a fix. And that is the problem in this case with the MRI scam. The fix is there. In response to what Senator Knowles said, the only thing that did not happenâthat could have happened, that should have happenedâwas the calling in to the case of the AFP. That would have laid things well and truly beyond any doubt. But if it looks as if there is a fix, if it smells as if there is a fixâand in the case of the MRI scam there was a boom in sales, and I will get to that later onâthen what other conclusions can you make? There is a fix on, and you do not have to be a genius to work out in some instances that the fix has been put on.</para><para>The fact that no-one saw anything, no-one knew anything, no-one said anything or no-one heard anything has absolutely no relevance when you consider the beehive of activity that was taking place around this very expensive piece of equipment. One questions quite quickly the value of the judgment of some people when they went scurrying to put orders in because they had missed out on the fix. And that takes up a point that Senator Knowles made about the backdated orders. What about them? The only conclusion I can come to in this whole process is that the backdated orders were put in by those who missed out on the fix. They missed out. Sad. So their way to get into the loop was to put a backdated order in. Senator Knowles saidâand quite rightlyâthese are being dealt with by the DPP. But that does not stop the fix from having been there and the fact that these people missed out on the fix in the first instance. The only thing that I can say about this is that the ministerâlike Fine Cottonâshould have either had his registration papers checked or at least been swabbed, because one can only draw the conclusion, as I said, that there is a bad stench, a bad smell, about what has taken place around this MRI scam.</para><para>What about the departmental officers and the other people attending the meetings? It seems as if they were in a vacuous situation when they were holding their discussionsâthey merely looked at each other and there was no formal note taking or reports of the meetings of any substance. Of course I have been around long enough to know that, if you give the appropriate wink, nod and nudge at the right time, people get the message very loudly and clearly, and they get it very quickly indeed. So quite contrary to what the government is saying, this has a real bad stench. </para><para>It is worth while, in the time that I have available to me, to take this chamber through some parts of the report in question, because much is being said without referring to the actual comments made by the Auditor-General in the report before us, report No. 42. Before turning to the individual parts of the report, I point out that the Auditor-General generally carefully words the reports that are put out. They are very cautiously worded; they are not something where you would say that the Auditor-General would be likely to run out and make very rash conclusions about any subject that comes before this Senate chamber. Given the contextâthat is, that there is a conservative approach in the construction of reports by the Auditor-Generalâone can only then assume that the conclusions the Auditor-General comes to shed grave doubts on the propriety and the probity of what happened with Minister Wooldridge; one can only come to that conclusion.

At section 2.29 the report continues:</para><quote><para>The Minister stated that he discussed the supply measures in general terms only, in response to queries from radiologists: </para><para>âI can't say I didn't make a comment, but I didn't disclose the mechanism of supply.â</para></quote><para>So there it is, in the minister's own statement:</para><quote><para>âI can't say I didn't make a comment, but I didn't disclose the mechanism of supply.â</para></quote><para>The minister continues:</para><quote><para>âThe radiologists raised the issue of limiting supply. I have a recollection that they were worried about anything that would limit supply, they would prefer no limit on supply. And the conversation was incredibly brief. I may have said a few things to be polite, but that's all ... I didn't need their sign off or agreement, there was no point in me raising it.â</para></quote><para>This is supposedly an experienced minister with experienced staff and that is the recollection of that meeting. The report goes on at section 2.30 to state:</para><quote><para>The departmental officer present and the Minister's adviser dispute the radiologists' recollection of the meeting.</para></quote><para>So we have a dispute as to what took place at the meeting. That point is clearly acknowledged in the Auditor-General's report. The report continues:</para><quote><para>They do not recall the specific matter of machines on order being discussed. They consider that the Minister did not disclose that machines on order would be in the supply controls, or reveal any other aspect of supply controls. Neither do they recall the radiologist advising that he had placed orders.</para></quote><para>The report goes on:</para><quote><para>No substantive conclusion about inappropriate disclosure of budget sensitive information could be expected on the basis of such contradictory evidence, all of which was collected using the Auditor-General's powers to direct under s 32 of the Act, and much under oath or affirmation.</para></quote><para>So there was an attempt to gather evidence, but there was a conflict of evidence, contradictory evidence. Of course there was no attempt at all to involve the AFP in this process, which I believe would have been an appropriate step indeed. The report continues:</para><quote><para>However, when considered alongside the differing recollections of what happened at Task Force meetings, it is a reasonable judgement that negotiation and consultation with the College and open debate about supply controls probably created an environment where some participants may have deduced, or become aware, that the Commonwealth was giving consideration to inclusion of machines on order.</para></quote><para>That is very veiled, very thin language for saying, `It looks as if there could be a fix, might be a fix. There is no absolute proof necessarily, but it is very much in the balance of probability.' The report goes on at section 2.34 to state: </para><quote><para>The other significant aspect of the 6 May meeting, in the context of the Government's stated wish to include MRI in the MBS, was the fact that it may have signalled agreement had been reached with the College and that a Budget measure to include MRI in Medicare benefits was likely.</para></quote><para>The report goes on, and I read this because the conclusion is the important part:</para><quote><para>The ANAO notes that College records and evidence from College representatives indicates that a departmental representative had a separate informal meeting with the College representatives one or two hours prior to the 6 May meeting with the Minister. Again, this is of significance, given the timing.</para></quote><para>Then you come to the ANAO's conclusion in that section about the involvement of the minister and his staff in negotiations. Point 2.37 says:</para><quote><para>On the balance of probabilities, when the views of all participants are considered, whatever was said or done at the meeting of 6 May 1998 seems to have had some influence on the following surge in orders for machines, either directly or indirectly, between then and the six days to Budget night.</para></quote><para>On the balance of probabilities it is quite clear that there is a stench. It is quite clear that there is a smell. And where there is a stench and a smell the issue should be pursued to its final conclusion. The Australian people expect transparency and openness, not people trying to cover things up. If you go to page 88 of the report, you will find that this is very similar to the Fine Cotton affair, where Fine Cotton came in from 33-1 to 7-2. On page 88 of the ANAO report, you find the figure which shows that in January 1998 there were three machines for which contracts had been signed. In February 1998, there were nil. In March 1998, there were eight machines. In April 1998, there were six machines. You could say that the radiologists were like Fine Cotton: they had been running dead. Of course, then you get to May 1998 and suddenly the odds have shortened. We go from three machines, eight machines and six machines to 33 machines.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Senator John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âI concede that some of those were back ordered, Senator McGauran. But 33 machines? So if we are not on a fix, what are we on? `Never back odds on'; and `Never run up steps,' said Ken Howard, and never could anything be truer than that. Here we have 33 machines. It is not as if you are going out to buy something worth $5, $10 or $20. We are looking at substantial expenditure, even if an order is being placed. The people must have known something. As I said, there were some who obviously did not know anything. There were some the day Fine Cotton won who did not know it was a fix until people started to yell it out. The only thing was that then they could not get their money on Fine Cotton. The radiologists had a bit more success. What did they do? They went and backdated the orders. What did they do then? They found themselves caught up with the DPP, and rightly so. But the fix was on. The fix was there. There were people who were clearly part of the fix.

They even tabled this ANAO report in the 24 hours after the budget, hoping beyond all hope that it would be buried and that any concept of there having been a fix would be somehow erased and lost in the budget process. Of course, the only problem that the government had is that the budget fell flat on its face in a very short space of time, so we were able to give this the attention that it deserves. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There is no doubt in my mind at all that you do not have to be Einstein to sit here and read this report and to see that the fix was loudly and clearly on.

What the people of Australia demand and what they are entitled to is openness and transparency. When you see that there was a mass rush of orders coming in to a total of 33, you understand that the odds had shortened. The government surely must realise that there is a real stench about this deal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>14450</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf there is any openness and transparency in this place, it comes from the Auditor's office. The Auditor has found that there is no reason to believe that the Minister for Health and Aged Care in any way acted improperly or leaked any sort of material related to the fact that, on budget night, there would be restrictions placed on the purchase and operation of MRI machines for the receipt of medical benefits. The whole case put by the opposition is an absolute nonsense. This minister is criticised when he should be praised for bringing magnetic resonance imaging to the people of Australia. Magnetic resonance imagingâor MRI, as it is knownâis a major new imaging technology. No longer do you have the old black-and-white pictures of X-rays where you get a few vague hints of what is in the soft tissues but can see only the bonesâor the outlines, as with ultrasound. Now, you can actually look at soft tissues with MRI. MRI is a very sophisticated imaging technology and Michael Wooldridge, to his credit, has brought it to the people of Australia.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âAnd to the rural districts.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>âAnd to the rural parts of Australia, in particular. As Senator Knowles said, under Labor there were a measly 18 MRI machines in Australia, concentrated as usual in the capital citiesâcertainly not in the poorer areas of the capital cities but in the major teaching hospitals and a few big private hospitals. Under Michael Wooldridge's jurisdiction, there are now 66 MRI units spread all over the country. As my colleague Senator McGauran has noted, 17 are in regional Australia. This marvellous technology is such a help in the diagnosis of complicated conditions, such an assistance to surgeons whoâfor exampleâwant to take out brain tumours and such an assistance to physicians who need to be sure of what is exactly where. As Senator Knowles mentioned, even in the case of multiple sclerosis MRI is helpful in identifying where the lesions are. This technology, through the good work of Minister Michael Wooldridge, is now available to Australian people wherever they live, whether it is in a major metropolitan area or a regional centre with a sophisticated diagnostic imaging centre.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When this government came in, following the Labor Party's failure to provide this service around the country, Minister Wooldridge looked at this issue and decided that a task force should be set up to work out how MRI services should be provided around the country. This task force from the Commonwealth department of health was to work with the College of Radiologists to set up parameters and to establish clinical guidelines and indications for the use of what is a very expensive technology. The point has been made several times today that MRI machines cost something like $3 million. While Labor was in office, the few people who had access to MRI machines had to pay fees like $500 to $800 for an MRI scan. But Michael Wooldridge felt that criteria should be set up so that MRI scans would be available under Medicare to the people of Australia, and that was a very important objective.</para><para>A task force was set up with the College of Radiologists. That was a very responsible action. This task force worked through all the issues facing them about clinical indications and broad guidelines for various disease processes as criteria for when MRI was appropriate and set up plans for the monitoring of MRI by the Health Insurance Commission, and so on. A comprehensive set of rules was set up. Because the minister was the minister for health and because this was interesting new technology, Minister Wooldridge had some involvement with this task force. But, in fact, the Auditor-General found that he had only three meetings with the task force. He left the work of the task force to the task force. These meetings were on 27 October 1998, 10 March 1999 and 6 May 1999. The minister had general meetingsârather than specific meetings where he would discuss the detailâbecause this work was being left to the task force to undertake. </para><para>It seems that the key meeting, which is attracting a lot of attention from the Labor Partyâand which they are trying to beat into something far more significant than it really was, as they usually doâwas the final meeting, the meeting of 6 May. The significance of that meetingâand, no doubt, the reason why it has attracted the attention of the Labor Partyâis that 6 May was not long before the budget of that year. So the Labor Party have got themselves into a lather. Senator Evans became tremendously excited today, as did Senator Crowley during question time, trying to imply that some significant and sinister event occurred involving Minister Wooldridge in the meeting of 6 May. The key paragraph in the whole Auditor-General's report does deal with the meeting of 6 May, just before the budget. I might quote it for the purposes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. This is paragraph 2.27, and it reads:</para><quote><para>All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agree that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures. However, they are all of the view that, in the context of the College expressing concerns about site restrictions, there was discussion of the possibility of including machines on order as of Budget night, although this was only discussed as an option.</para></quote><para>That is a very significant thing to be recorded. It is important because it makes it quite clear that the minister was at that meeting and there was some discussion of the possibility of a restriction being placed on the purchase of machines on budget night and the eligibility of these machines. But there is no suggestion at all that the minister revealed that that was going to occur; it was simply a discussion of an option. The important thing is that it was discussed by the radiologists. </para><para>We have to bear in mind that radiologists are very intelligent people. Their business involves looking at pictures, X-rays and ultrasounds. They are experts at picking up subtle inferences, subtle suggestions. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âYou are making it sound like they ran the minister through the MRI machine.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>âThat is the business of these people. I think we should bear it in mind that they are clever people. We have heard that the college representatives there that night do agree that the discussions were confidential and, to their knowledge and recollection, it is agreed that they did not pass the information divulged on to others. The only exception to this was to the new President of the College of Radiologists. The previous president attended the meeting on 6 May and he passed this information on to the incoming president. This is the other significant aspect of the 6 May meeting in the context of what has happened, and I read from paragraph 2.34 of the Auditor-General's report: </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... it may have signalled agreement had been reached with the College and that a Budget measure to include MRI in the Medicare benefits was likely. </para></quote><para>That was not stated but was a suggestion in the report that there might have been a feeling that that was the drift of the department. This is quite significant, again, when one looks at the professional status of the people who were at that meeting. The fact is that in the period between the 6 May meeting and the budget, which I believe was on 12 May, some 33 machines were ordered. It has been suggested from the discussions that have occurred today that in some way that implies that the minister had passed on information or leaked information. But, as I said, nobody has said that that occurred, and there is no doubt that the minister did not leak information. Nevertheless, the fact remains that all these machines were ordered. </para><para>We need to look at who ordered them. The fascinating thing is that, of the task force members who were at that meeting on 6 May, five members of the task force ordered nine of the machines. Two members of the task force were responsible for no less than eight of the machines. When you think that each of these machines was valued at $3 million, it means that two members of the task force had put in orders to buy $24 million worth of machines. If we go back to Senator Hogg's racing metaphors, it would seem that members of the task force at least were part of the `fix' to which he refers. This means that, of the 33 machines that were ordered, at least nine of them were ordered by people on the task force who perhaps were clever enough to draw a conclusion that it was possible that on budget night some sort of restrictions would be placed on the ordering of further machines and on whether or not the use of these machines would be eligible for Medicare rebates, and these people acted accordingly. </para><para>As I said, 33 machines were ordered between 7 May and 11 May. But not all of these machinesâin fact, few of them, if anyâwere paid for. They were ordered on conditional purchase arrangements. It seems that some 11 of these orders that were put in during that period were conditional purchasesâin other words, the purchases could be revoked at any timeâand 11 had backdated orders. That means 17 of these orders over that period could be said to have been ordered in the anticipation that there might be some change in the budget but they were not sure and, if no change occurred, then they could cancel the order. The fact that these orders were set up in such a way that they could be cancelled suggests very strongly that there was no leak; there was no specific information. These people, as Senator Hogg would say, were just taking a gamble. They were taking a bet that there might be a bit of a change or some sort of regulation introduced on budget night but they were not sure. They thought they would put in an order that they could withdraw if necessary, so that if nothing happened they could withdraw it and all would be well. They would not be financially disadvantaged.</para><para>I think you can conclude that, rather than the minister leaking, there were some radiologistsâand radiology, after all, like all professions is actually a village, so people talk to peopleâwho were clever enough and astute enough to seek to gain an advantage, and they were the ones who made up the 33 orders that were placed in this short period of time between 7 and 11 May 1998. But this does not mean, does not imply, does not suggest and does not prove in any way that there was a leak. In fact, if I go back to paragraph 2.27, it states:</para><quote><para>All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agree that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures.</para></quote><para>In other words, there is plenty of evidence there from reputable witnesses that the minister did not in any way reveal what was in the budget.</para><para>These radiologists are trained, as I said, in picking up subtle suggestions and subtle signs, and remember also that radiologists are businessmen and that radiology is a field of medicine in which huge fees are generated and where equipment is very expensive, as we have heard today time and time again. These MRI machines cost $3 million each, and radiology equipment in general is very expensive. So these people are big businessmen and they knew perhaps that it was important for them to take the gamble so that they would be in the race if there were some sort of restriction placed on the availability and use of, and eligibility for, rebates for MRI machines. So 33 machines were ordered.</para><para>The minister, according to everybody there, did not reveal what was in the budget, but the minister is today being vilified and attacked by the ALP, who know that they have so much to be ashamed of from their own record of providing technological imaging around Australia. They are so ungracious that they are unwilling to acknowledge the great contribution this minister has made to the people of Australia by enabling access to this kind of very sophisticated imaging around this country. Michael Wooldridge, without any doubt, deserves to be recognised as one of the great Australian ministers of healthâif not for anything else then for this arrangement where he has provided this sophisticated level of imaging through the Medicare system so that the people of Australia can have access to it at very low cost. </para><para>I would prefer to see on record in the Senate a motion praising Michael Wooldridge and thanking him for the great service he has provided to the Australian people, rather than this nonsensical witch-hunt which is going on and which is driven by a Labor Party bereft of policy ideas and bereft of leadership. The Labor Party has nothing better to do but try to beat up out of nothing a criticism of a minister who, as I have said, has made an enormous contribution to the level of health services in this country and should in fact today, if anything, be the subject of a motion of thanks on behalf of the Australian Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>14453</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is nice for Senator Eggleston to come in here and talk with a gentle voice and have a modest, reasonable discussion about everything except what is under debate. What is under debate is the Auditor-General's report, which is a damning indictment of improper ministerial behaviour. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is up to his neck in the scan scam. If you do not want to get him for that, you should certainly get him, as the Auditor-General's report says, for incompetence as a minister in charge of his department. I note that on page 57 at paragraph 1.1, under the heading `Policy development' and the subheading `Introduction', it states: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Government policy is the responsibility of Ministers, with Cabinet as the primary focal point of the decision-making process.</para></quote><para>Government policy is the responsibility of ministers, and government performance and departmental performance are the responsibility of the minister. So even if you wanted to forget, as senators opposite have been trying to do, what we think is the critical and central point in this debate, you would have to condemn the minister for the absolutely incompetent departmental performance. There were no records kept of notes, no meetings documented, no risk management properly put into the considerations and so onâall of which is documented in the Auditor's report.</para><para>The selective evidence from my government colleagues is painful to listen to. First of all, just for the record, I would like to read from page 131 to try to put some proper sense into this. The Labor Party have been kicked to death by the good Liberals opposite because we failed to provide MRIâmagnetic resonance imagingâmachines around the country, and any flippery diddly words to condemn the Labor Party for their failure to act appear to suffice. On page 131 of the report is a copy of the minister's letter to the Auditor requesting an examination, and it states:</para><quote><para>MRI is a relatively new scanning technologyâ</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>âRelatively.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>âExactly so. Yes, Senator Herron, you and I would not have too much of a fight about this.

Those operating outside public hospitals were funded from a variety of sources including direct charges to patients.</para></quote><para>So let's not say that the Labor Party lay around for 13 years doing nothing. The Labor Party, indeed, had overseen the introduction of 18 publicly funded MRI machines in the major public hospitals, which were then delivering those services at no cost to the people who were able to access them. Senator Herron more than most would know that, under the previous Labor government, we had a high-tech committee that examined these new machines as they came in to see that they were effective, that they did deliver a service that was an improvement on what was there before and that they were appropriately placed so as to see a better distribution and access for people in the community. Probably whichever government was in power would have had to look at increasing the numbers of them.</para><para>This report condemns the way the machines arrived in this country after that. This report condemns Minister Wooldridge for his grossly improper way of providing the information that led to the scan scam. The selective quotes from those opposite need to be properly addressed. My colleague Senator Hogg, to say nothing of other colleagues from the Labor side, has made this clear. But they need to be read again, and I shall read them. Paragraph 2.37 on page 86 states: </para><quote><para>On the balance of probabilities, when the views of all participants are considered, whatever was said or done at the meeting of 6 May 1998 seems to have had some influence on the following surge in orders for machines, either directly or indirectly, between then and the six days to Budget night.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>âIf we had done this, Senator, you would be in here, no doubt, saying that we should be condemned and criticised for it.

If the Auditor is coming through and having a look, what is on your email, senators, that might be required to be put into the public record? We hear a little about people who pass the odd joke around the place, but what about diary dates? What about meetings? What about conclusions drawn at those meetings? I think we should have some very clear guidelines, not just for departmental officers but for members and senators, so that we are aware that these documents may well finish up in the public record in the not too distant future.</para><para>This is a matter that needs to be looked at very closely by the department. But, as I said at the beginning and as it is said so well on page 57, government policy is the responsibility of ministers and so is the behaviour, the processes and the conduct of a department. The processes are very much up for grabs and criticised here. But the more important issue is: what do you say about a country that has 62 MRI machines one day, has a meeting with the minister, who is the only person at the meeting to really know the facts, and in the next five days another 33 machines at $3 million for each machine are ordered by people with specific access to the information and a specific interest in the outcome of the benefits of that budget payment to them? </para><para>We know, as Shakespeare said, that there is something very rotten in the state of the health department and this minister's meeting. There is something very rottenâand the Auditor-General has spelt it out very clearlyâa deep, deep smell, a deep, deep stench, and it is foul. It is about misappropriation of public dollars. It is about very irresponsible behaviour, much of which is already under investigationâa matter of some disappointment to the minister. I am not sure `slippery' is the word to apply to this minister, but the Auditor-General has made it clearâand it is a line that must be read again and again, over and overâthat all but one of the people at that meeting have stated it was `initiated by the minister', the person who knew, the person who has to be condemned and stands condemned by this damning report. The minister, Dr Wooldridge, ought to resign. It may be the only honourable thing he can do in this whole sordid mess. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14457</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPerhaps in line with the Shakespearean analogy, Senator Crowley doth protest too much.

When a minister of the Crown is slandered under parliamentary privilege and people say that he was dishonest, that he leaked information and that there was ministerial impropriety, it is a very serious issue. It is not a laughing matter. MRIs are especially valuable for the early detection of life-threatening neurological conditions, such as brain tumours and tumours in bone or soft tissue. MRIs are also the single most accurate way of diagnosing multiple sclerosis, so that early treatment can slow the onset of its debilitating symptoms. All of these things that MRI scans do are great things. It is just a terribly great pity that the Australian Labor Party have failed to recognise the benefits that these MRI scans can give not just to rural and regional Australians but to all Australians. Since the introduction of the rebate, the average cost now of a scan is about $45 to $50, with a waiting time of one or two weeks.

That is where this report is damning, absolutely damning, about the lack of accountability, transparency, proper note taking and the failure of the department and the minister's office to keep appropriate notes, be they in print form, the hardcopy form or emails or in any other form. I suspect that the shredder has worked overtime.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a damning report on administration. Anybody who follows this particular issue of transparency and good governance will know immediately that this is very, very slack. It is becoming the usual and the norm that we expect from this department and, I suspect, from this minister. I do not know who is at fault. I have been following the community affairs committee for a number of years now and, each time we do an estimates, it is taking longer and longer for answers to come back. We have now got to the stage where we are asking the department to provide us with the dates at which answers go to the minister's office. We are now, through our committee, able to find out when those answers get to the minister, and they are sitting in both ministers' offices for weeks and weeks. </para><para>This seems to be a pattern that has developed in this department and in these ministers' offices. I do not know whether it is incompetence and inability on the part of the departmental head to get information, but I do not think it is. I think that, because of the example of the length of time that answers take to be cleared by ministers' offices in terms of answers to questions taken on notice in estimates, in fact it is the incompetence of the ministers' staff or of the minister himself or herself. This attitude in action here fits a pattern of the failure of good governance and I think the minister should look very closely at the classic of the Westminster traditions. He says that he is not responsible and that he did not do it. The story on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last night was just walking totally away from the situation, being appalled at the behaviour of the radiologists. I have been known on occasions to be quite critical of doctors and their behaviour and will continue to be but I do not think that all of the doctors in the Royal College of Radiologists are as conniving, mean-spirited and greedy as the minister would have made them out to be last night.</para><para>You only have to start reading the Auditor-General's report and having a look at the returned order that finally turned up yesterday as well. Mind you, there is a whole stack of pages that say `Contents omitted because they are not relevant', and I would love to know how that decision was arrived at on a number of occasions. I am finding reading the advice to the minister and the briefing note to him before he goes into the meeting on 6 May very interesting. It suggests to the minister that he get them to give a brief overview of their proposals and their status within the college executive and council; that he indicate that he considers them to be a `comprehensive and sound set of proposals'; that he explain to them where things are, in the budget context; and that he point out that there are some problems and that it is `not just a matter of giving the proposals a tick', but that the minister was `optimistic' about it being agreed to.</para><para>Now if that is not giving a nod and a wink to a blind person, I do not know what is. This is obviously giving some pretty clear indications that they are on the right path, and I am not surprised that there is nothing in the minutes at the outcome of this meeting, which I find very strange. Again, it is not good governance and it is not good administration. There is no transparency. That is what this is all about: this is about the administration that this government runs. The Prime Minister won power in 1996 and was going to have the most squeaky clean and highest standards ever. This is the lowest standard that you could possibly come to. It is very fortunate indeed that in this country you are innocent until proven guiltyâbecause, by golly, if you had to prove your innocence out of this report, you certainly could not do it!</para><para>One of the previous speakers talked about the bounds of probability. Bounds of probability and within reasonable probability gets down to common law levels of proof and, when you are only the difference away, that is a bit close to the bone, I would have thought, for the minister. The briefing also says that the minister should also seek to allay their concerns by telling them that the government will `keep them advised of developments' and will `take them through the papers' on budget night. It tells him to `appreciate that they may see it as smoke and mirrors'. Hmmm! Very interesting! It says that there will need to be `some housekeeping post budget to get things in order and to reflect the proposals as agreed' and that this will be dealt with `by correspondence and other documentation'. I do not know what `other documentation' can mean. My guess is that it could be emails. He is advised to `ask them what problems this may cause the college and discuss ways to address these'. This was what the minister could talk about at the meeting of 6 May.</para><para>The question I would like to know about but that we cannot get an answer for is that it would obviously be normal practice for there to be a set of minutes for that meeting. None existed. But then, we get around to when the agreement was signed and the letters were sent to the college to ratify the agreement; they were all sent after the budget. I do not know about anybody else, but I do not know of anybody with a modicum of intelligence that agrees to a proposal without knowing what the proposal is. This is a proposal that was agreed on 6 May. Surely to goodness we are not going to be told that they would have signed up to something not knowing the full details. They are not stupid people. They are intelligent people. They are businesspeople. </para><para>I also do not know how you can enter into contracts to spend $3 million without having to lay down some penaltyâif you have actually signed up tight enough. Let us face it: those of us poor mortals who cannot visualise $3 million certainly do not get any option to contemplate spending $3 million and sign off on a legal dotted line on a binding contract and then have the option to be able to withdraw from that contract, if it does not suit us, without some penalty. You cannot tell me that that happens, and yet that is what was expected to happen.

So doctors do get special treatment. That is very good to hear! I also wanted to raise the issue, because it actually comes through these notes that have been tabled, that there is a difference between the private and public sector in the radiologists' spending here. We have heard about all the machines that have come to country areas. Let me tell you that very few have come to the public sector in rural areas, and that is a major concern. If this is such an important issue, why isn't this government ensuring that the major teaching based hospitals in the rural areas of this country actually have their own MRI, so that the critically ill patients who come in through Casualty and A&amp;E can actually get their MRIs undertaken? If it is such an important piece of diagnostic equipment, why aren't they in the public sector where all the acutely ill patients are taken? Why not? It is not because they obviously did not care about it: they did not think the proposal through. This is as crook as Rookwood.

People ask him, `If the economy is supposed to be going so well, why are things so tough for me and my family?' They are asking why, when the government says the economic good times are rolling, their local public hospital is overcrowded and cannot cope with more than the most urgent cases. They ask him why the local public school is run down, the computers broken and the classrooms overcrowded. And they ask why they are getting hit almost every month now with another rate rise on their mortgage. And they are asking why, when things are supposed to be going so well, the society they live in is getting harsher, less caring and more divisive.</para></talk.start><para>These people who have asked these questions over the last 12 months would have found no answers on Tuesday night from this budget. Indeed, all that Australian families would have found in this budget would have been higher taxes, higher prices and more pressure on interest rates. Even more importantly, they would have seen this budget on Tuesday night for what it is: a budget of lost opportunitiesâlost opportunities as the government squanders its bottom line, gleaned from cutting programs in education and health and regional services, to spend on what? Nothing but the GST. For all the big talk in the budget about doing the hard yards and all the talk about historic reforms and strong prospects, it is all invested in just one thingâthe GST.</para><para>At the core of this budget, after nine successive years of growth, we find nothing to comfort Australians, to reassure them the government believes in a future for this country. After the billions of dollars in cuts made to government services in its first term, this government has been forced, beyond all the limits of prudence in a growth economy, to spend all the proceeds, and then some. The Treasurer knows he is stuck with this budget to bring in the GST. But he knows it is the wrong budget to ensure a sound economy at this stage of the economic cycle. When he should have been assisting the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low, the Treasurer instead has been forced to accept a tax he once described as snake oilâJohn Howard's GST. And he has been forced to accept the huge spending bill to try to compensate people for its effects. </para><para>The amazing thing is that, with all that spendingâ$6 billion in this budget aloneâthey have still managed to leave substantial numbers of Australians without any form of compensation. Remember, this is the government which has cut $5 billion from social services since coming to powerâmuch of it directed at families. Now it is imposing a $30 billion GST which will principally be borne by families; a tax which means that every time you have a child you effectively go up into a new tax bracket. The fact is, as most Australians know, mortgage rises are already chewing up the so-called GST compensation for families with children on an average income and on an average mortgage. Their tax cuts are already gone before they arrive, and the full GST is only 51 days away.</para><para>Even more vulnerable is a family like John and Wendy, from the government's own GST TV ads. If John and Wendy are expecting a child in December this year and John has an annual income of $30,000 and Wendy $28,000, they will, under the new tax system, when Wendy stops work, lose $67 a fortnight in the existing parenting payment. Even the government admits this leaves John and Wendy only $12 a fortnight to pay the GST. And the latest analysis shows that they will be $16 a fortnight worse off after the GST. </para><para>We had a look in the budget on Tuesday night and actually found $15 million to set up an office to look at cases like John and Wendy's. But there was no money in the budget to pay them any compensation. So we have the farcical situation where the government will spend $15 million to discover that John and Wendy are worse off, but will not spend a single cent to help them.</para><para>To further confound and confuse Australian families, we had the spectacle last night of the Treasurer, in a fit of pique over the budget's poor reception, saying the promised tax cuts were not meant as compensation to people for the GST. `Income taxes had to be cut anyway', he said. This is exactly what Labor has always arguedâthat you can have tax reform without a GST. What the Treasurer is telling families is that the inadequate compensation package for the GST is actually no compensation at all. It was owed to people for the effects of inflation since the Howard government came to office. But that is this government all over. It is like someone who comes along and pinches $1,000 out of your back pocket, returns four years later with a $50 note and expects you to fall on your knees in gratitude.</para><para>The one piece of news in this budget was the $2.8 billion surplus, yet almost immediately that was shown to be a giant con trick. Nine years into economic recovery, we find in reality there is no surplus at all. The $2.8 billion was conjured up literally out of thin airâout of the sale of communications spectrum for an estimated $2.6 billion. The Treasurer himself has told us asset sales should not be included in the budget bottom line. A business could not get away with that, but the Treasurer thinks he can. Take away this fiddle, and the budget would be in surplus by a paltry $200 million.</para><para>Today the situation became dramatically more serious. The parliament learned that because of the false classification of a major payment to the states the budget is actually in deficit. Combined with other fiddles, the outcome of this budget is really a $2.1 billion deficit. It has taken all of three years for this Treasurer to turn a $10.7 billion projected surplus into an effective $2.1 billion deficit, and this at a time of strong economic growth and huge growth in revenue. According to the measure used by prominent economics forecaster Access Economics, the true structural deficit is actually more than $5 billion. Is it any wonder then that this has been, of all their budgets, the most critically received by the economic commentators?  </para><para>In the past four budgets we have seen Peter Costello smirking his way through his budget speech as he went around trying to convince the markets and the commentators the pain would be good for us and the gains would soon be here. But on Tuesday night the smirk had gone, and all that remained were thin lips and a hushed backbench. What this week has doneâmake no mistakeâis finally expose what we on the floor of this parliament have known all along: the Treasurer has a glass jaw. He has had it easy in his short political career, but as soon as the heat is turned up he starts to go to pieces. We were trying to recall when we had last seen him look so uncomfortable. Was it when he verballed Alan Greenspan and single-handedly moved the US bond market? Was it when he did the macarena with Kerri-Anne Kennerley? No, it was when he suffered the ultimate humiliation of being made Alexander Downer's deputy.</para><para>I have said this is a budget of lost opportunities. And this is because of what was not in itâno plan for the future, no vision for Australia and no ideas. It is a tragedy for this country that at such a time of changeâwith new communications transforming the workplace, innovations coming thick and fastâwe have a government as backward-looking as this one. Like most other Australians, members of the Australian Labor Party have been debating how our education, training and communications networks will measure up to the challenges of the future and how we can and must invest in new ideas. Do we see any evidence of this debate in the government ranks? People look to their government at times like these to provide leadership. The tragedy is that, at the very time we need it most, we face a government without inspiration, ideas or vision. This budget reveals that in spite of the enormous challenges we face in this country to become a knowledge nation this government under Prime Minister John Howard can only focus on a 1960s European socialist tax idea, the GST. </para><para>Australians are already paying the GST. They know that prices are already going upâin the supermarket, in the department store, on their car and home insurance and in so many other ways. Let us briefly examine some of the things we know of this tax and what it will do. We know it will take $30 billion out of the pockets of ordinary Australians each yearâa figure, by the way, you will labour in vain to find in the government's budget speech, although they do finally admit to it when you read the fine print. This tax, we now learn, will lead to immediate price rises of a staggering 6Â¾ per cent, a figure you never heard mentioned by the Howard government in any of their GST propaganda up until now. Before the election we were told prices would go up by only 1.9 per cent. So we will have this big increase in prices which, as we all know, will hurt the most vulnerable in our communityâthe elderly, new parents, students, self-funded retirees, pensioners and others. Economists are predicting more interest rate rises for home buyers as a result of this budget. Already we have seen four rate rises since last November. And if you think the surplus is disappearing, just wait until you see the tax cuts disappear. </para><para>We now know the government does not think the tax cuts compensate people for the GST adequately. But even if somehow families did see them as some form of compensation, their effect, according to the government's own budget papers, is snatched back after just one year. The total tax take from individual taxpayers bounces right back to their levels of this year after only 12 months. And a year later, taxpayers are on average $600 a year worse off. So these tax cuts are a mirage. The other great neglected story of this tax is the huge burden of paperwork it will add to owners of small and medium businesses around this country. We know the struggle they are going through right now trying to install new software, wrestling with complex regulations, trying to gear up to become government's tax collectors all around this country. These businesses are in fact spending $4 billion on that process.</para><para>Let me state very clearly, and let me state very clearly for you, Senator Kemp: a future Labor government will be committed to rolling back the Howard government's GST to make it fairer and simpler. While we will roll it back, we know that the Howard government's agenda is to roll the GST forward. Everyone knows that this government want a GST on all foodâthey wish there was one on food now. Likewise, everyone knows that under the Howard government the GST rate of 10 per cent will inevitably rise. To roll it back we need to know how this tax operates over the next 12 to 18 months. We need to know who is hit hardest and what its surprises are, and we need to know how much money is available to roll it back responsibly, while attending to our other priorities.Even the government, as is amply clear from its vanished budget surplus, does not know what the budget will look like at the next election.  </para><para>For our part, we will not make any promises that we cannot afford, unlike the Prime Minister with his core and non-core promises in the 1996 poll. We will tell the Australian people our plans before the next electionâan election that should be at the end of next year, after another Howard budget. For the moment, we can assure them that our priorities will be fairness to the weakest and most vulnerable in society, including charities; lifting the burden on small business, especially the administrative complexity; lifting the burden on education and health; and lessening the impact on jobs. At the next election the Australian people will know fully what we intend, and they can decide between a Beazley Labor government that will roll the GST back or a Howard government that they know will roll it forward.</para><para>Perhaps the greatest cost of all of the GST is the way that it robs the future to pay for the pastâthe way that it takes more than $25 billion out of future budget surpluses to pay for a tax instead of going towards the knowledge nation to position us to take advantage of the huge scientific and technological changes we are facing. There are far more important issues for this country to debate than issues of taxation, like how to develop a highly paid, highly skilled work force using the best technology to improve the production of goods and services. Yet this is an agenda that this government publicly deride. They simply do not understand that these ideas are no longer optional extras for governments. They are a new economic reform agenda for modern nations around the world. We all now largely agree on the old agenda: the need for fiscal discipline, an independent monetary policy, deregulation of financial markets, the floating of the dollar, low inflation and a more open economy. The agenda is moving on but not the Howard government.</para><para>There are many dimensions to the knowledge nation, and I want to spend just a little time on a few of them. I begin with what was meant to be the focus of this budget: regional development. Regional policy is about investing in modern infrastructure. It is about making the regions part of a vibrant national economy and part of a successful knowledge nation. Without this vision we face an ever-diminishing and ageing rural and regional population. Labor has higher aspirations for country Australia than this. We know what problems many of our regions are confrontingâpopulation decline, young people moving away, jobs drying up and country towns disappearing. Some of our regional communities have shown that it does not have to be this way. They have answers. They know what regional Australia needsâinvestment in information technology so that they can create new industries and new jobs. They know that it means better funded regional universities and TAFE colleges to bring in new skills and new measures to tackle the salinity crisis to protect the land and give agricultural industries a secure future. But they need the Commonwealth government to give them the resources so that they can get on with the job. The Howard government has totally failed to invest in the future of our regional communities. There is no new infrastructure spending, no new money for country roads, no new money to improve access to communications bandwidth and no new money to help sort out mobile phone problems. </para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said that his political mission was to `meet the reasonable expectations of country people'. With this budget he has well and truly failed. While I am on the subject of his failure, let me talk about his failure to stand up to his Liberal counterparts on perhaps the most important asset rural and regional Australia has to connect itself to the new economy, and that is Telstraâhis failure to stand up to the Liberal Party on Telstra. No Labor government will sell Telstra. This is not ideology; this is commonsense. We need Telstra to make sure it meets our national priorities. I note from this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that Telstra has finally found out who its true enemies areânot those of us in the Labor Party who want to see it prosper and thrive. Its enemies are those in the government who have been talking down its value for their own ideological reasons. </para><para>The second knowledge nation area I want to tackle is the vital one of education. Our education system is a vital national asset. We must develop it or see our stocks as a nation fall. Yet the Treasurer's speech on Tuesday night contained just two paragraphs on educationâtwo paragraphs on what is without doubt the most important responsibility the government has. Every leading competitor nation of ours is investing its wealth in human capital. In the United States Al Gore has pledged to increase investment in education by 50 per cent by 2010, if he is elected President. Just a few months ago the Singapore government announced a 20 per cent increase in education spending. On Tuesday night Peter Costello announced new education initiatives of just $62 million over four years. That is 86c per Australian, per yearâthe price of a cheap ballpoint pen, like this one I am holding. What is more, it is barely one-sixth of the $360 million that this government is spending on its GST ad campaignâpropaganda for a tax no-one wants versus investment in the skills everyone needs. Those are priorities for you!</para><para>The government took up one of our good ideas in the bonded scholarship for doctors to go to regional Australia. How about picking up one or two of our education ideas as well, like our teacher development contracts to assist teachers to go back to university to gain specialist knowledge or our teacher excellence scholarships to attract to the profession high achieving school leavers in fields such as maths, science and information technology? Every parent knows instinctively what the latest research confirmsâthat well-trained and motivated teachers are the best chance their child has got to succeed at school and in life. Yet this country under this government is going the other way. We are unique among developed nations in reducing our public commitment to education.</para><para>Five years ago, Commonwealth spending on education was at 2.2 per cent of GDP. This year it will be at 1.8 per cent. In another four years, if this government is not thrown out, it will be at 1.7 per cent and Australia's chance of becoming the knowledge nation will be ruined. Just today the science and technology budget statement revealed a further fall in Commonwealth support for science and innovation. This budget proves beyond doubt that the Howard government has given up on the elements we need to become part of the new economy.</para><para>While I welcome the government's move to assist some regional non-government hospitals, I believe the government still does not understand the number one issue in health: the state of our public hospital system. Across Australia the main issues are the absence of public hospital beds, the waiting times for certain procedures and, sadly, the poor quality of care now available. If Australians cannot have confidence in their public hospitals, what sort of country have we become? We are all affected, yet the Howard government refuses to provide greater hospital funding. The government has a report from an independent expert which says that over the next four years the system needs an extra $620 million just to provide the existing level of services to our growing and ageing population. A good government is willing to invest in community infrastructure, such as quality hospitals. Just imagine, if the $360 million this government is spending on its GST ad campaign were invested in public hospitals you could fund an extra 1,200 new hospital beds.</para><para>What is really needed right now is a driving, active, nation building governmentâone that has the will to forge real change in this country. Governments must provide leadership to create the climate in which our best minds can work together to bring about new knowledge and translate ideas into economic growth. This is not politics. This is the future. It is not about the next election or who wins and loses. It is about what sort of country we really want for our kids, because we have a chance to shape this nation. The role of government is to provide an excellent education system and the best incentives for science and technological research, underpinned by a first-class communications network. That is what the Labor Party promises. </para><para>Finally, let me say that the lack of vision in this budget is not surprising from a government in love with the past and at war with the future. We have seen it on the republic, on Aboriginal reconciliation, on foreign policy. We are now seeing it all through our domestic economy. One thing that has amazed me is that in the selling of this budget so much of the government effort has been aimed at attacking us, the Labor Party. Since the poor reception of this budget has unfolded and as the government has become more sensitive to public fury over the GST, its need for a deceitful and personal political strategy has become evident.</para><para>When you cannot defend your own budget, you demand that the opposition produce its 2002 budget right now. When this does not work, you attack the Leader of the Opposition. If that does not work, you demand the right to one more victory over Paul Keating. My advice to my fellow Australians is: when you hear any of this reach for your wallet. You will find it minus your share of the $360 million GST ad campaign. Recognise this strategy for what it isâa lushly funded smokescreen over a judgment seat they hope you will never sit in.</para><para>On Tuesday night, the Treasurer delivered his budget speech. It was a very telling document. The first 11 pages were predictable, stodgy and uninspiring, but the last five pages tell the tale. They are all blank. These are the pages the government could have used, and the pages that will be used under Labor, to set us on the road to the knowledge nation. These pages should have told us how our kids would be better educated to face the great challenges of the new economy. These pages should have set down the way in which this country can establish a better health system. These pages should have been used to restore the welfare of families, who are at the centre of our society. Labor will fill these pages. We will fill them in a way that answers those questions we are so often asked by Australiansâquestions about how to achieve economic growth with fairness. Fairness for Australian familiesâthat is the Australian way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>14466</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to respond to this budget on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Budget 2000 is the budget which marks the completion of Mr Costello's slow metamorphosis into a latter-day Mr Keating. Not content with adopting Mr Keating's style and economic policies, in his determination to pull a surplus laden rabbit out of a hat, Mr Costello delved into Mr Keating's dusty old bottom drawer full of phoney accounting techniques and heroic economic forecasts. Indeed, as I read through Mr Costello's economic forecastsâthe figures that have to be positive for this budget not to plunge into deficit this yearâI kept thinking that if this budget were a song it would be the Monty Python song <inline font-style="italic">Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</inline>. I do hope Mr Costello gets us down to the 6Â¼ per cent unemployment rate. But with job advertisement growth slowing, with interest rates hitting business and consumer sentiment and with no new initiatives in this budget to promote jobs growth, I have my doubts as to whether we will get there.</para></talk.start><para>The forecasts of nine per cent business investment growth, of moderate wage growth and of a falling current account deficit and even the key 3Â¾ per cent economic growth forecast all lean well away from a balanced view towards a distinctly optimistic one. I hope these forecasts are realised. But, with forecasters like BIS Shrapnel predicting growth falling to just 1.1 per cent next year, I wonder if this is the right budget for the times. To paraphrase Graham Chapman in Monty Python's <inline font-style="italic">The Life of Brian</inline>: Mr Costello is not the economic Messiah; he is just a very haughty boy. The Treasurer is prepared to cut social spending more than is economically or socially justified to appease the gods of the financial marketsâgods who are notoriously fickle, gods who have short memories and gods who are, more often than not, not interested in Australia in the first place. Fran Kelly on Radio National, the morning after the budget, closed her interview with Mr Costello by saying, `I feel a mantra coming on.' I know exactly what she meant. Five years on, Mr Costello has had only one economic refrain: debt reduction, debt reduction, debt reduction. That is despite Australia having the fourth lowest public sector debt in the OECD and despite our private sector liabilitiesâforeign debt and investmentârising sharply over recent years. </para><para>The Costello budgets have been similarly single-minded. It is <inline font-style="italic">The Life of Brian</inline> again: five budgets, five crucifixions. So let us do some casting. I thought the currency traders could adopt the role of the suicide squad from the Judean People's Front, marking the dollar down over half a cent before the Treasurer had even finished his speech on Tuesday night. But, on reflection, Mr Beazley and the Labor Party make a much better suicide squad. Their assertion that Mr Costello had contrived a budget based on phoney accounting was a classic case of shooting themselves in the foot. I well recall Mr Beazley's last budget as Minister for Finance in 1995, when he claimed a $700 million surplus. But, when asset sales and net advances were taken into account, the real result was a $7.2 billion deficit. To play the role of the indecisive People's Front of Judea, spending their time passing motions that something should be done but doing nothing, the National Party is perfect. This was supposed to be the budget for the bushâthe budget that pulled regional and rural Australia out of the economic doldrums. The Prime Minister, in Quorn in my home state of South Australia, promised a big boost for infrastructure in the bush. It failed to turn up in the budget, a point not missed by the National Farmers Federation. But the Nationals, having threatened, fumed and fussed for months, all lined up politely to applaud this budget that failed to address the inequity of economic opportunity between metropolitan and regional Australia.</para><para>Unemployment in regional Australia is now running at twiceâand in some places, like northern Tasmania, three timesâthe unemployment rate in Sydney. This should have been the budget to even up the speed of growth on both tracks of our two-track economy. But that would have meant Mr Costello abandoning his obsession with debt reduction. This, in my view, would not have been a bad thing. Nine years into an economic upturn, I certainly do not believe that Australia should be spending its way into deficit to fund normal government expenditure. But modest borrowing for capital investment, public investment in infrastructureâfor example, regional transport, communications or human capital like university education, our public school system and research and developmentâis perfectly justifiable.</para><para>I repeat again: Australia has the fourth lowest level of debt in the OECD. Indeed, in yesterday's Press Club speech Mr Costello said other countries could not understand that the Australian government was not borrowing more. This is because most OECD countries regard obsessive debt reduction as a stupid strategy, and it is. If the Australian government were a company, the markets would be marking our shares down for not having sufficient gearing. A poor gearing ratioâor low borrowings, in other wordsâsuggests that a company is not employing capital to best effect and investing. That is exactly what this government is doing. Government non-financial assets are scheduled to rise by just 0.4 of one per cent this year, with a rise in value of non-military infrastructure of just $77 million. That is hardly the stuff of a far-sighted investment strategy to secure Australia's economic future.</para><para>Education and research remain the government's biggest failings as the OECD warned in its most recent <inline font-style="italic">Employment Outlook</inline>:</para><quote><para>It is only by directing attention to the critical need to develop long-run policies to increase the skills and competencies of the less skilled, and to encourage the businesses where they work to invest in this human capital, that further sustained progress on improving the standards of living of disadvantaged groups in OECD countries will be possible.</para></quote><para>Yet under this government investment in education has fallen from 5.2 per cent of GDP to just 4.4 per cent of GDP. Funding for targeted higher education research fell by 5Â½ per cent in real terms, and funding for other higher education research and development fell by 2.3 per cent during the same period from 1997-98 to 1999-2000. I can well imagine that Minister Kemp's favourite song might be Pink Floyd's `We don't need no education', a self-evident falsehood if ever there was one. By contrast, there have been substantial boosts to R&amp;D funding over the past two years in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Canada, the USâand the list goes on. In fact, this year Mr Clinton aims to boost funding for university based research by eight per cent. The Irish Prime Minister, who has recently established a $1 billion `Technology Foresight Fund', said in Melbourne during his March visit: </para><quote><para>It is clear from the Irish experience that research and development in higher education has been absolutely crucial in our efforts to attract knowledge-based industries to invest in our economy.</para></quote><para>Mr Howard could not have been listening because his government has cut $1 billion a year from education funding for universities, vocational education and student assistance.</para><para>Mr Beazley now says he will reverse this trend and make Australia the knowledge nation. Well, I would like to know how. I want to remind people, especially Labor Party senators, that in the last election he failed to actually tell us. The self-styled `education Prime Minister to be' pledged to put back just $170 million of the $1 billion that Mr Howard took out of education. This amounts to less than 20 cents in the dollar. In 1998 Mr Beazley failed the biggest test of his leadership as he did not explain how he would repair the damage done to Australia's education systemâhis plan was more hot air and rhetoric than real hard cash. Most telling of all, he has raged against the very tax reform which will guarantee a solid revenue base to underpin increased expenditure. </para><para>Back to <inline font-style="italic">The Life of Brian</inline>. I said that this budget, were it a song, would be `<inline font-style="italic">Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</inline>'. Let us take a look at the bright side of this budget. There is about $2 billion for new initiatives that the government has agreed to since the last budget and, in many instances, these initiatives reflect the persistence of the Democrats in pursuing social and environmental policy outcomes. Indeed, the two biggest new spending initiatives since the last budget, aside from East Timor, were the $750 million increase, in real terms, we won for pensioners and social security beneficiaries and the $230 million a year in new environment programs we won also in negotiations on the tax package.</para><para>I want to talk about the fiscal effect of the agreement we won as part of our negotiations on the GST last year and make two points. Firstly, contrary to some ill-informed comment, the Democrats did not use the surplus to fund the $3 billion to $4 billion cost of GST changes, particularly in making food GST free. The cost of these revenue changes was fully met, as we always said they should be, by revenue itemsâ reduced income tax cuts, increased diesel excises and the retention of some state taxes. </para><para>Secondly, we did agree to fund the social security and environment programs by drawing on the surplus and that, we believe, is entirely appropriate and we do not resile from that one bit. The 1996 budget comprised cuts of over $1 billion from social security and income support. Those cuts left the most disadvantaged in our societyâthe poor, the aged, the sick and the unemployedâshouldering more than their fair share of the burden of deficit reduction. As the budget moved into surplus, we always argued that those who had endured the pain involved in creating the surplus should be the first to benefit from the gains. </para><para>Our $750 million a year social security increases, in real terms, combined with the cost of GST-free food, effectively cancel out most, if not all, of the $1 billion of cuts to the social security payments. The disadvantaged paid the price of creating the surplus and they should reap the benefits. I might add here that Labor went to the last election offering no increase in social security payment or pensions. The Democrats have delivered far more to the three million Australians relying on social security than Labor ever would have done. I note as an aside that in 1993, when the ALP put up the wholesale sales tax rates, there was no long-term compensation for low income earners either in the tax system or in the social security system. Clearly, it is the Democratsânot Laborâthat is the party of social responsibility.</para><para>On to environment programs: this government, like the previous Labor government, has failed to effectively address the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This government's failure tracks right back to the crazy 1996 budget decision to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation. The new funding the Democrats won for energy efficiency, renewable energy and greenhouse gas abatement programs has trebled government funding on greenhouse issues. This is well in excess of anything Labor promised to do in its 1998 election policy. On the environment, the Democrats have always been miles ahead of the Labor Party.  </para><para>This budget reflects many other new programs that the Democrats have worked long and hard for. The $560 million rural health program contains many measures that have long been Democrat policy and that we have pushed and pushed the government to adopt. However, we are very disappointed that, yet again, they have failed to deliver on dental death. </para><para>The $46 million for additional legal aid funding was very much a result of continuous lobbying of the Attorney-General by the Democrats and an agreement with him, although it falls short of the government's original commitment of $63 million of new funding. It seems that somehow $20 million of this was excised from the cash-strapped legal aid system to fund the political fix diversionary schemes that the Prime Minister negotiated for the Northern Territory to soften its mandatory sentencing.</para><para>The $132 million to ease the assets test for farm families for youth allowance has been Democrat policy for over 10 years, and in fact there is an amendment passed by the Senate waiting to put this into operation. We have moved again and again that same set of amendments in the Senate, and now we finally have the funding to fund it. The $240 million compensation for hospitals for a reduction of FBT salary packaging concessions is a major win for us and also, in particular, for our public hospital system. Related to this is the $535 million of changes to FBT treatment for charities we negotiated, raising the FBT exemption for charities from the $17,000 promised by the coalition and Labor at the last election to $30,000. </para><para>The $13 million for a new childhood nutrition program was a direct result of our tax negotiations. The $100 million in development aid for East Timor represents a small down payment on the Democrats' longstanding call for Australia to invest heavily in repairing the infrastructure of that country. It is nowhere near enough but it is a start. It is very disappointing that the overall overseas aid budget has now fallen to just a quarter of one per cent of GNP, barely a third of the level recommended by the UN. The strategic importance of aid is lost when compared with the $228 million increase in defence spending. Indeed, had a good defence management plan been in place, one-off defence payments would not be necessary.</para><para>The $240 million books industry plan represents funding won by us, with most of it going to the textbook subsidy scheme. The remainder is allocated to the establishment of a much sought after education lending rights scheme for Australian authors, an assistance package for the Australian printing industry and a program to increase holdings of Australian books in school libraries.</para><para>Finally, the government have also responded to the Democrats' announcement that we did not support its proposal to increase beer excise prices on 1 July by effectively owning up to the fact that they have had their hand in the till to the tune of at least $150 million a year. That measure is a step in the right direction, and we are yet to process all the numbers to determine whether the $150 million is in fact enough to deliver on the government's pre-election commitments regarding the price of ordinary beer.</para><para>In short, the Democrats have been very influential in winning real gains in social policy and environmental policy across a wide range of portfolios over the past year. We have achieved those gains by persistent public campaigning, by working with industry and with community groups and through specific negotiations with government. </para><para>I have a few other comments to make on specific portfolios. Firstly, schools: I cannot understand why funding to government schools will increase by only 21 per cent over this four-year periodâabout where the CPI is expected to goâwhile funding for non-government schools will increase by 40 per cent. This appears to reflect Dr Kemp's ideological prejudice against public provision of a well-resourced education system. The Democrats welcome the $240 million stronger families and community strategy, particularly the additional subsidies for in-home care for rural and remote families living too far away from child-care centres. However, these initiatives will not fix the child-care industry's problems caused by earlier funding cuts and rule changes. </para><para>In the rest of the social security portfolio, the government continues its obsession with throwing people out of the social security net by the introduction of more and more cumbersome and onerous requirements. We are very sceptical about the $60 million savings from the introduction of preparing for work agreements for all new claimants of unemployment benefits. Basically, when you add the figures up, this government is hell-bent on making the system too complex for another 7,000 Australiansâso off they will go to the charities. We also question the introduction of pilot programs to increase mutual obligation conditions for mature age unemployed, long-term unemployed and unemployed parents of school age children, especially when the government's own welfare review is yet to give its final report.</para><para>On the savings side, the Democrats welcome the inclusion of family trusts and private companies in the means test for income support. In the environment portfolio, there are virtually no new measures or funding other than the greenhouse measures won by the Democrats. On the one hand, we have a Prime Minister who acknowledges that salinity is a huge challenge for this countryâechoing the findings of his own Science, Engineering and Innovation Council; on the other hand, we have a Treasurer ripping $62 million out of programs designed to tackle this enormous and growing problem. Also, the forward estimates provide no clue as to what will happen when the Natural Heritage Trust money runs out in 2002. It reads as if environment spending simply disappears after that, and we believe very strongly that the environment spending should be funded from core government revenue. It is far too important to continually rely on asset sales. Eventually, they too will run out.</para><para>On immigration, the Democrats believe that this government is about to waste $116 million on the minister's obsession with boat people, including $52 million to build more detention centres. Yet there is no new money to help people who have come here or to improve processing services for people who want to come hereâtourists and business people, as well as migrants. Indeed, language and literacy training for migrants is being cut.</para><para>The government's attack on public broadcasting continues with the refusal to grant the ABC and SBS any additional funds for new content for digital television or even to use the full capacity by multichannelling, even though digital is scheduled to begin in less than a year. </para><para>This brings me to revenue. Given the needs in our health and education system, I think it was irresponsible not to proceed with the East Timor levy. This would have meant the East Timor commitment could be met from the levy and the general revenue used for our public hospitals and schools. Of course, the big news on the revenue side is the tax cuts and the GST, both taking effect from 1 July. It is not apparent in the figures in this budget, but the new tax system and all the changes will actually increase revenue collection in this country. Treasury's conservative estimate of additional revenue is about $2 billion a year in 2000-01. However, as Ross Gittins points out in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the revenue increase is likely to be larger than that, as the ABN system is certain to bring in much revenue from the black economy. As well, the GST as a growth tax is almost certain to raise more than was originally predicted for the states.</para><para>I emphasise yet again that repairing the revenue base is why the Democrats went into tax reform in the first place. The income tax cuts refunding the bracket creep occurring since 1993, the GST replacing the less efficient indirect tax system, the huge crackdown on tax avoidanceâparticularly by trusts and businessesâand the business tax reform all add up to a tax system that has far more capacity to fund the social expenditure Australians increasingly want from government. By signing on to tax reform, the Democrats have also shown themselves to be more economically responsible than Labor. Labor wants the revenue from tax reform but does not have the bottle either to reform the tax system itself or to now say it will repeal the tax. Labor will not repeal the tax and is saying so very clearly, but it still rails against it. What a terrific strategy! With a repaired revenue stream, government will no longer have to rely on creative accounting practices to deliver real surpluses and real spending increases, as Mr Costello has been caught doing in this budget with the spectrum asset sales proceeds, the timing of grants to the states and the Reserve Bank dividends. </para><para>Coincidentally, today is the 10th anniversary of my first speech in this place. I have now the rather dubious honour of being the longest serving Democrat senator ever. It amazes me how much things change yet stay the same. Ten years ago, the 1990 budget was Mr Keating's last as Treasurer. The 1990 budget painted a picture of an economy that would slow gradually under rising interest rates, delivering a surplus of $8 billionâthere were pages and pages of positive forecasts. But not a single forecast was met. Growth, instead of being the forecasted two per cent, crashed to minus 0.9 per cent as the `recession we had to have' arrived. Unemployment shot up. After taking out all the dodgy accounting, the budget surplus disappeared and re-emerged as a net borrowing requirement of some $700 million. Mr Keating ended up Prime Minister.</para><para>Ten years later we have another budget delivered in a climate of rising interest rates, replete with heroic assumptions and a soft surplus forecastâand I hope history does not repeat itself. I wish this government had more of a sense of where it wants to take this country in the difficult times ahead. I wish it were not obsessed with debt in purely economic terms, while ignoring the enormous social and environmental debts that are building up as our education system crumbles and the Murray-Darling Basin is clogged with salt. I wish this government had more of a sense of how this country will position itself to take advantage of the new knowledge based economy. I wish this government had, as a priority, the sharing of the benefits of economic growth with the disadvantaged. After all, we must surely judge a society by how it cares for those who are least able to cope on their own and, in particular in the current climate, those who are not coping with rapid change. Those elements are missing from this budget. This is a budget that hopes things will be rosy and bright. For Australia's sake, I really do hope that the forecasts in this budget are met. Unfortunately, hoping is not a sound strategy.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>14471</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That the Senate do now adjourn.</para></motion><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title><page.no>14471</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>14471</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight on the adjournment to continue comments that I made on the last occasion the Senate sat: comments in relation to an inquiry, which took two years, that was conducted by the Senate into indigenous education. We did come up with something unique in recent times in the Senate, and that was a unanimous report of that Senate committee. It is very pleasing to see that the government, through other mechanisms, is now moving along the tracks that were suggested in the major recommendations of this committee's report. There was, however, a major cloud over the proceedings of the inquiry because of a matter of privilege that developed. I did report, in part, on that matter of privilege during the last time I spoke. I want to update the Senate on what is happening in this continuing saga.</para></talk.start><para>The problem at issue was that a witness appeared before the Senate committee in the town of Brewarrina in western New South Wales. You would call Tony Wiltshire, the witness who appeared, a classic whistleblower. He did see the problems in the Aboriginal community in Brewarrina; he did see that the local authorities, particularly the local shire council, were not dealing with those problems properly. Indeed, many of the decisions of the council in what it was doing under its general manager, Peter Felsch, were actually damaging to relations in the town and the conditions in the town in terms of the hopes and aspirations of the Aboriginal community; these things were getting worse. As one of the Aboriginal people in the area said, `We really just wish we could get a decent go.' I want to report tonight on how, since that inquiry, that decent go certainly is not there. Indeed, the petitions that have been sent to me and the letters that have been sent to me from the Aboriginal community do indicate that things are getting worse, and I want to outline tonight to the Senate what is happening in that regard. </para><para>But, first of all, I will deal briefly with the latest developments in relation to the whistleblower in this case, Tony Wiltshire. We do have a Privileges Committee and it did consider this matter and it did find the General Manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, Peter Felsch, guilty in regard to the intimidation of a witness, Tony Wiltshire. The very sad thing since that event is the effect it has had on Mr Wiltshire's career and his life. As a matter of fact, he had a very good career in the field of welfare and had done an enormous amount of good work over many years.</para><para>That career has now been destroyed. Mr Wiltshire enjoyed his job. He was very committed to the local people in Brewarrina. He lost his land in Brewarrina. He also lost many close friends in the area because he has now moved away from there. He has resigned from the council; he has resigned because, he said, he is not going to put up with any further mistreatment. This shows the very serious effects of whistleblowing and the fact that we do not seem to have the measures right in this country. There have been many cases of whistleblowing over many years and, for the people who do have the courage to stand up and indicate what is wrong, the outcomes, the effects on their lives in subsequent times, have often been very badâand this is yet another case.</para><para>Tony was a man of courage to actually do what he did. It exposed what was happening in a small country town that the rest of the world had not particularly noticed. We are in a process at this time, particularly with the Aboriginal people, of reconciliation, and these small country towns are really a very good place to start. One of the reasons we did go to the town of Brewarrina was that this process of reconciliation at the ground level seemed to be breaking down. This applied particularly in the areas of education and training and employment. We saw evidence of it at the local school. Sadly, what has happened over the years is that the white children have been sent by their parents to the local Catholic school and the indigenous population at the local public school has been 97 per cent. This happened and evolved over the years, but there are no measures or any attempts to actually change and address this situation.</para><para>Another issue of great concern in a related area has been in the area of training. The problem being faced in Brewarrina, as the Aboriginal person said to us, is that they are not really getting a fair go. This concerns a training project which had been funded by the federal government, had been implemented through the state Department of Aboriginal Affairs and involved the Weilmoringle road project. It is a multimillion dollar project, involves the construction of an all-weather surface and was to go over four years. One of the purposes of the agreements that were made by all the stakeholders was to maximise Aboriginal employment and training. Two Aboriginal men were vital to the project, Tom and Noel Powell. They had a family history dating back a long way of working in road construction in the area. It went back 25 years to their father, Noel Powell Sr, who worked as a contractor for the Brewarrina Shire Council.</para><para>The plan for employing Aboriginal trainees came from a program written by Tom Powell, and he designed the plan as a program development officer with the Department of Juvenile Justice. The plan provides employment and training for young Aboriginal people. It is very good idea. It is a remote area and an area of very high unemployment. The plan was designed by the Aboriginal community and met the needs of the Aboriginal community. It was discussed by various members of the Brewarrina community; members and employees of the council, including Peter Felsch, the general manager; the New South Wales Department of Aboriginal Affairs; the Goodooga Working Party; ATSIC; and the Darling Murray Alliance. They all gave support to this plan. The opportunity to implement the plan in the Weilmoringle road project fitted into the funding criteria of the Aboriginal community development program under the New South Wales Department of Public Works and Services. </para><para>From the beginning, the Aboriginal community believed there would be an Aboriginal mentor to guide the trainees and an Aboriginal contractor to train the trainees on the project site. It was very clear who would perform these roles: Tom Powell would act as the mentor and Noel Powell would provide grader equipment and instruction to trainees. The plan sold so well under this guise to all parties that funding came through from the New South Wales Department of Aboriginal Affairsâ$2.2 million over four years. Once funding was approved, the story takes a downward dive.</para><para>Noel Powell was officially informed by the Brewarrina Shire Council in a letter dated 8 July 1999 that he would be hired to provide contract grader services and instruction to trainees once funding was approved. Funding was approved. Another letter, dated 25 November 1999, stated the original offer was withdrawn. The letter provided no explanation as to why Noel Powell had been dismissed from the project. Five months later, there is still no sufficient answer. </para><para>Let us turn to the issue of the mentor for the trainees. This position was funded by the Barwon Darling Alliance. It was the impression of all involved that the mentor would be used to help trainees during the course. But, under a revised contract by the general manager of the Brewarrina Shire Council, the position was cut in the initial six months of the project. Again, there was a lack of reasons for why this position was abolished.</para><para>The major concern is that there is a lack of consultation between the general manager of the council and the local Aboriginal community. The Aboriginal community in Brewarrina wants answers. How is it that Brewarrina Shire Council became the sole project manager? Many groups were involved in the development of this project. The sole project manager allowed council to sign off on the project agreement without consulting other parties involved. This incident has undermined the principle of the Aboriginal community development program. The funding was given, in part, to this project because it met certain criteria, but the dismissal of the two Aboriginal contractors, who were perfectly placed to train indigenous people, is a mystery and goes completely against the program's objectives. </para><para>This incident has created great disquiet in the town of Brewarrina. We have contrasting programs in Moree that are working very successfully and are a good sign of reconciliation. But this project in Brewarrina is a very disturbing sign that, at a local level, this sort of reconciliation is breaking down, and it should be investigated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport Safety: Contiki Tours</title><page.no>14473</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>14473</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate a serious matter recently brought to my attention concerning reports that the reputation of the Australian tourist coach industry as a safe and professional service provider is being placed at risk. Through the New South Wales branch of the Transport Workers Union, I have been made aware that the activities of one internationally well-known tourist coach company is placing the lives of coach drivers and passengers at risk and jeopardising the reputation of the rest of the industry.</para></talk.start><para>The company in question is Contiki Tours, which is owned by the Travel Corporation and, as I understand it, this is the same company associated with the Interlaken disaster. Coach drivers driving for Contiki have reported that as a result of the company's rostering procedures they are regularly being compelled to work excessive periods without the required rest breaks and that they are driving in states of fatigue. In one instance I have been informed of a driver who worked in excess of 80 days without a single continuous 24-hour rest break. These tourist laden coaches are a time bomb waiting to explode. The effects of fatigue on vehicle drivers and continuous periods of work without rest are well documented. They were recently the subject of an inquiry conducted by this parliament and for the last statistical year were identified as the primary cause in more than 25 per cent of road accidents.  </para><para>While Contiki continues to push its drivers over the edge, forcing them to drive to rostering procedures that fail to schedule adequate and appropriate rest breaks, the incidence of driver fatigue in the industry is only bound to increase. As a result, for each day Contiki continues these practices, the chances of a major coach accident involving numerous fatalities are also increasing. The Australian tourist coach industry cannot afford a multifatality accident. On the eve of the Olympics such an easily avoidable disaster could irrevocably harm Australia's reputation as a safe and professional tourist destination. What makes matters worse is that not only are Contiki drivers being compelled to work fatigued but also the company's attitude to basic minimum safety standards and regulatory requirements for its vehicles displays a similar disregard for the safety of its drivers, its passengers and the reputation of the industry. </para><para>It has been reported to me that vehicles operated by Contiki have operated for an extended period of time without working indicator lights, continued to travel in an unroadworthy condition with passengers, and in one instance undertook several extended trips despite having been reported to be experiencing brake problems on two previous occasions. Contiki cannot continue to get away with operating under these conditions. Not only are they breaching industry requirements and road regulations, but they are placing tourists, coach drivers and the reputation of the Australian tourist coach industry at an unacceptable risk. They must be stopped and Contiki have to be called to account before a serious bus accident adds to the list of people already unnecessarily killed on our roads. I have asked the union to refer these allegations to the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority so that they may be investigated. We do not want a repeat of the road tragedies that we had in the early 1990s. Surely we have moved on from there. However, it appears that that may not be the case.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>McKay, Reverend Dr Fred</title><page.no>14474</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14474</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFrom 1967 to 1971 I was the Methodist minister in Cloncurry in north-west Queensland. It was there that I first met Fred McKay and his wife, Meg. He was then the superintendent of the Australian Inland Mission, which was the forerunner to the Uniting Church's Frontier Services and also the auspice for the formation of the Flying Doctor Service under the Reverend John Flynn. Fred's brother Les, who conducted the Burke and Wills patrol for the Presbyterian Church, and Fred and his wife visited us regularly at the manse in Cloncurry and stayed with us. I remember that one of the reasons Fred McKay was at one stage regularly in Cloncurry was that a memorial to the Royal Flying Doctor Service was built on the site of the old Presbyterian church in Cloncurry. That church was the site of the first transmission of the Royal Flying Doctor Service network and Cloncurry itself was the place where the Royal Flying Doctor Service first began. </para></talk.start><para>Ten years before the Uniting Church came into being I was part of a cooperative parish with the Methodist Church at Cloncurry and the Presbyterian Church at Julia Creek. It was a very fruitful cooperation. In the middle of that period when I was there, I too became a patrol padre. At the same time, my long-time friend the Reverend Bob Philpot was also a patrol padre, and we covered the whole of north-west Queensland. Not long afterwards, we wrote a book called <inline font-style="italic">Bulldust and Spinifex</inline>, which represented both of usâand it would be easy to tell which one of the two I was. </para><para>But I want to talk about Fred McKay. Fred McKay was one of the most positive, inclusive people I have ever met. In the worst of circumstances he would be looking for an opportunity to turn those circumstances around and to affirm God's providence in spite of everything. One could not help feeling that Fred McKay wanted to be your friend. He was the sort of person that you not only felt you could follow but you also wanted to follow. In fact, that attraction as a person, as a man and as a leader was so powerful that, even having been appointed by the Methodist Church to a parish in Brisbane after five years in Cloncurry, when Fred asked me to go to Darwin I looked for ways to get out of the appointment and go there. Unfortunately, it did not happen.  </para><para>I want to read from the many media references there are to Fred McKay's death and to put on the record just some of the story of his life. One such reference reads: </para><quote><para>âPadre Fredâ, who was born in Mackay, died on March 31, aged 92. </para><para>He was a patrol padre in far western Queensland from 1937 until 1940.

I quote from the eulogy given by the Reverend Doug McKenzie and his wife, Maisie:</para><quote><para>Ordained in 1935, Fred became a control padre for the Australian Inland Mission, the forerunner of the UC Frontier Services.

In deference to the traditional owners of that area, that stone was returned to the original site.

In 1998, when introducing the then new youth allowances, the government claimed that 560,000 young people would be beneficiaries, but only about 390,000 young people have qualified for youth allowances. Why did the government inflate these figures by over 160,000? How have these 160,000 young people who lost their allowances been coping? Why has the government done nothing in this budget to restore youth allowances to those most in need?</para></talk.start><para>The level of the parental income test has been, and remains, ridiculously low. At present, $23,800 is still the point at which the maximum rate of youth allowance starts to reduce. Payment reduces by 25c for every dollar in income above this threshold. The small increase to compensate for the GSTâ2.5 per cent and perhaps some indexation after 1 Julyâwill not improve this situation.</para><para>Other longstanding concerns about youth allowances have been ignored in this budget. Not the least of these is denial of access to income support for unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds and the growing number of young people in crisis or requiring crisis accommodation. Youth allowance was allegedly targeted to families and young people most in need; hence, the income and assets tests, as for other welfare payments. By not increasing the level of the income test, the government has revealed its true agenda. The government is in the business of progressively paring down youth allowances and squeezing young people into dependency and loss of faith.</para><para>The government has badly let down 160,000 young Australians. Before the introduction of youth allowance, 30,493 unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds received the youth training allowance, and 103,143 young people aged 18 to 20 received Newstart allowanceâa total of 133,636. In addition, 458,000 young people received Austudy, made up of 201,200 secondary recipients and 256,800 tertiary recipients. Immediately before the introduction of youth allowance, about 590,000 young people were receiving government income support assistance.</para><para>The government claimed that about 560,000 young people would be assisted by the new youth allowance program. The government's claims at the time were that 27.5 per cent of the young people receiving income support would receive more money, mainly because of expanded access to rent assistance for studentsâand I am sure you remember this well, Senator Patterson; 64 per cent would in fact receive the same money; six per cent would get a reduced amount, because of the expanded parental income and assets tests; and, finally, only two per cent would receive no money, because of parental income and assets tests and because of the removal of income support to unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds.</para><para>That is what the government said at the time. How many young people now gain assistance from youth allowance? In March 2000, there were 270,351 full-time students, 2,408 part-time students and 86,859 job seekersâmaking a total of 357,210. In June 1999, the total was 395,456âstill far short of the 560,000. These seem like a lot of figures, but indeed the point lies in the articulation of these figures into the parliamentary record. </para><para>Through its administration of youth allowance, the government achieved savings by applying parental income and assets tests and the family actual means test to a wider range of young people than had occurred previously. Savings were also achieved by the use of tighter income testing rules, as applied under the Social Security Act 1991, instead of those of the Income Tax Act income assessments, formerly used under the Austudy payment. In 1998, it suited the government to claim the high figure of 560,000 as the expected number of youth allowance recipients, as this high figure helped them to sell the scheme. Now, of course, the government is smug about its reduced outlays on youth programs and income support.</para><para>And what about the much-vaunted rationalising of payments, the `one payment fits all' approach? It has not really happened. Differences in rates and assistance apply. The amount of youth allowance assistance varies, depending on whether the young person is a student or unemployed or living away from home or at home, and it also varies with age. The youth allowance test for students has been modified, retaining the $115 per week free area but with a taper of 50c per dollar for income of between $115 per week and $155 per week, and then a 70c taper for income of $156 per week and above. This test is more generous than the former Austudy test. However, for the unemployed, the old income test formerly used for Newstart allowance has been retained, leaving disparities in youth allowance support between students and the unemployed.</para><para>Again, the parental means test applies to students up to the age of 24 but, for unemployed young persons, it applies up to the age of just 20. For students in 1996, the age of independence was age 22 and it was then raised to age 25 for the 1997 year. For the unemployed, the age of independence was raised from 18 to 20 years with the introduction of youth allowance. The high age of independence and the low rate of the allowance are in accord with this government's stated philosophy that families should support young people until they have achieved full financial independence.</para><para>The trend is now one of increasing numbers of young people in crisis and requiring crisis accommodation. Often they move from one crisis service to another. Government programs, supposedly put in place to strengthen families, are contributing to the youth in crisis scenario. For example, the federal government's youth allowance has meant that families unable to support their unemployed 16- to 18-year-olds have to support an `unreasonable to live at home' application. In the ACT alone, seven social workers are employed at Centrelink assessing the young people applying for youth allowance and, in particular, the `unreasonable to live at home' rate for 16- and 17-year-olds.</para><para>Since January 1999, 16- and 17-year-olds qualify for youth allowance only if they are in full-time education or have their year 12 certificate or have had 18 months of full-time work in the previous 24 months or meet the youth training allowance independence criterionâwhich means that they cannot, and cannot be expected to, obtain or seek support from parents or guardians, for reasons such as domestic violence or parents being unable to exercise care. How many young people remain in an education system unsuited to their needs, simply because they need the youth allowance to survive? How many families have decided to support an `unreasonable to live at home' application simply because they cannot afford to keep their young people at home?</para><para>A 1998 consultant's report, Budget Standards for Australia, was commissioned by the Department of Social Security and prepared by the Social Policy Research Centre. The report calculated that a single person in rented accommodation would require an income of $292 per week in order to maintain `a standard of living which may require frugal and careful management of resources'. The `independent' rate of the youth allowance is only 45 per cent of this amount. If the government wants us to believe that it is committed to the goal of keeping young people in education and training for as long as possible, it will have to do better than to just extend the assets test threshold applying to some selected families.

Whilst that might not be the biggest petition that the Senate has ever received, I would argue that, given the very confined area from which it cameâthat is, Albury-Wodongaâit is a very large sample indeed of an expression of the will of the people in that area.</para></talk.start><para>That petition asks the Senate to request the Commonwealth to reverse its decision to fund an internal Hume Highway bypass of Albury and instead to fund an external Hume Highway bypassâas most large cities in rural areas in Australia can expect if they have a bypassâwhich is safer, shorter and cheaper than the one which is being proposed and being funded by the Commonwealth. The petition also asks the Senate to request the Commonwealth to commit funds to a second local road link across the Murray River. I thought that was worth mentioning because, as I say, 12,000 signatures were collected, I understand, over a very short time frame in a very confined part of Australia over an issue which those 12,000 people at least feel very passionately about.</para><para>Before parliament resumes again next month, the review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will have been completed. We cannot be sure what the outcome of this review will be at this stage, and the Democrats sincerely hope it will mean the elimination of nuclear weapons sooner rather than later. My concern is it is looking most unlikely, and I do not see Australia's role so far as promoting it sooner. In fact Australia is being seen in a somewhat poor light by non-government organisations in New York and by many countries as well. The perception is that everything Australia does is coloured by our defence relationship with the United States, and we have, for the life of this government at least, taken positions directly or indirectly in support of the United States. Last week in estimates the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials acknowledged that, despite the ratification of START II by the Russian Duma, progress on nuclear disarmament is, to say the least, going to be extremely slow.</para><para>One way Australia could have added pressure to the nuclear weapon states would be to join the other nations on the New Agenda Coalition, and I have raised this matter before in the Senate. The New Agenda Coalition was launched in Dublin in June 1998 with a joint declaration by the ministers for foreign affairs of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden. Since 1998 the coalition has put up two resolutions at the United Nations calling for a new agenda for the speedy elimination of nuclear weapons, neither of which Australia supported. Its working paper tabled at the conference called for:</para><quote><para>The five nuclear weapon states to make an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and, in the course of the forthcoming Review period 2000-2005, to engage in an accelerated process of negotiations and to take steps leading to nuclear disarmament to which all States Parties are committed under Article VI.</para></quote><para>I hope very much that Australia will support this call, and if it does not it will be a great pity indeed. The reason I have doubts that Australia will support it is that, during estimates, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in relation to the New Agenda Coalition:</para><quote><para>So we really do see the New Agenda Coalition as helpful in some respects ... but we fear that they risk offering false hope in disarmament in areas which are not practical. The whole process of disarmament is a very complex one. By its very nature, we believe that it has to be taken step by step and so on.</para></quote><para>Australia's Anzac Day six-point plan has been put forward at the review but, even if this were to be implemented, we would still have nuclear weapons. All it is is a plan to stop other states gaining weapons. Australia put up a proposal, co-sponsored by Japan, which the Acronym Institute, for instance, said was `so modest it almost fell backwards'. There were plenty of other critics too. The Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War said: </para><quote><para>While many of these points are necessary steps in the path towards disarmament, this bland offering contains vague language such as `further efforts' and `Possible future steps' ... The paper does not maximise the possibilities offered by this conference. Nor does it address the lack of success experienced by this very program over the past five year period.</para></quote><para>So I think it is fair to say we need to have steps to bring a commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons sooner rather than later. China, France, Russia, the UK and the US released a statement on 1 May which announced their:</para><quote><para>... unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of a complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.</para></quote><para>Whilst that statement is welcome, it does not give any commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons in the near future. There is no outline of any new measures, a timetable, or a program of action on how to achieve even that goal. And this commitment was matched by just as many saying that nuclear weapons were important to their national security. The use of the word `ultimate' I think says it all. We are not prepared to move in the short or medium term. `Ultimate' could be a century or more away. In the meantime, we could have the ultimate destruction of all mankind.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14479</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.06 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>14479</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>14479</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>A New Tax System (Family Assistance) ActâFamily Assistance (Higher Amounts) Determination 2000.</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâDirectiveâPart 105, dated 27 April 2000.</para><para>Defence ActâDetermination under section 58BâDefence Determination 2000/9, Housing and related assistance (Defence Determination 2000/1 - Amendment).</para><para>Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2000/10.</para><para>Migration ActâStatement under section 91DâPrescription of the people's republic of China as a safe third country.</para><para>Miscellaneous Taxation Ruling MT 2000/1.</para><para>Product Rulings PR 2000/51-PR 2000/54.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew ActâDispensation granted under section 20âDispensation No. 6/00.</para><para>Taxation Determinations TD 2000/19-TD 2000/22.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>14480</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Listing of Post Offices</title><page.no>14480</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1773)</subtitle><id.no>1773</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14480</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 19 November 1999:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	Is it the case that the location and telephone numbers of individual licensed post offices no longer appear under the `Australia Post' heading in the Melbourne Telstra White Pages; if so: (a) is this omission the result of action taken by Australia Post; if so, why has Australia Post taken that action; (b) what consultation did Australia Post undertake prior to taking that action; and (c) will or does this omission occur in respect of the details of licensed post offices in any other State.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14480</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	Based on advice received from Australia Post.</para><para>It is the case that location and telephone numbers of individual licensed post offices no longer appear under the heading for Australia Post in the Melbourne Telstra White Pages.</para><para>(a) Australia Post decided to remove the former block listing of individual corporate and Licensed Post Offices (LP0s) from the 1999 edition of the Melbourne Telstra White Pages and replace it with a centralised telephone inquiry point for its Customer Care Centre.</para><para>Australia Post advise that the benefit of listing a single inquiry point is that post office staff are not unnecessarily diverted from serving customers to answer routine telephone calls.
