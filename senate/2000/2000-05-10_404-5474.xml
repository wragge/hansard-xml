I was expressing concern because the people of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands do vote in federal elections, do elect members of parliament to represent them here, but they elect members of parliament from the Northern Territory. They do not have representation at any state level, yet they will be placed under legislation that is under the jurisdiction of the Western Australian government. This seems to me like another variation of no taxation without representation. These people certainly will not have any representation on that particular legislation, and it is not even federal legislation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6E4</name.id><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator Tambling</name></talker><para>âDid you say this when the Labor Party put through the Territory Law Reform Bill?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>âThis is an issue of concern. The previous work that had been done on this particular area was done in close consultation with the Western Australian government, with the people of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) and with the various organisations. But the changes that have been wrought upon the people of these islands now have not been done with the approval of anybody or with consultation. This is a very important issue for people to remember. These people are having this foisted upon them with no consultation, and it would appear that some of it is actually contrary to what they previously had sought.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also now want to turn to issues relating to the Madrid protocol. We do support that particular part of the legislation. It is important. The Madrid protocol was adopted in 1991 in response to proposals that a wide range of provisions relating to the protection of the Antarctic environment should be harmonised in a comprehensive and totally binding form, and it draws on and updates the agreed measures as well as subsequent treaty meeting recommendations relating to the protection of the environment. It designates the Antarctic as a `natural reserve, devoted to peace and science'. It establishes environmental principles for the conduct of all activities and prohibits mining. It subjects all activities to prior assessment of their environmental impacts. It provides for the establishment of a Committee for Environmental Protection to advise. It requires the development of contingency plans to respond to environmental emergencies and provides for the elaboration of rules relating to liability for environmental damage.</para><para>It is a very important piece of legislation. It is very important that we actual ratify it, and I understand that we thought we were right but this legislation has never been passed and, when another country signed up to the protocol, we suddenly found that we were lagging behind. But it is important. This is a wilderness area, but it is an area where people have been working, living and visiting for close to a century. As communications and technology improve, we find more and more people are actually going to visit the area, and this certainly places quite significant constraints and imposts upon the area. It is a very fragile place in terms of the ecology and the environment. Whilst the climate is harsh, things stay for a long time. The huts of Mawson and of the early explorers are still quite intact or the way they left them, unless the roofs have caved in. </para><para>We are also able to see the impact of the failure of previous expeditions and bases to appropriately or adequately dispose of their waste and their refuse. That is now one of the big issues facing the people in the Antarctic and the people dealing with the Antarcticâthat is, how do they undertake the reclamation work that relates to the tips and the dumps that were associated, or are still associated, with the bases? In some areas there is quite a decent cocktail of chemicals. Some of these are leaching into the sea, and it is quite interesting how they do leach and travel under the ice cap, or under the snow layer, into the sea.</para><para>You have in that area a major habitat for whales and other small animals who feed on the plankton and krill that grow there. These are fairly primitive life forms, meaning that heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals could be entering the food chain at a very early stage and so when people go fishing there, maybe illegally, for various fish or mammals they could be picking up quite heavily contaminated carcasses. The fact that they could be spreading across the world some of this contaminant is a major concern and it is a shame that this can happen. </para><para>A lot of work is being done to outline and determine how best to ensure that the overflow from these tips can be contained and how best they can be removed or whether they should be sealed. Important work is being done by the Australian Antarctic Division on that issue, and I think they are to be highly commended for the work they are doing. They are undertaking it in a very cautious and responsible manner because they realise that there is a need to ensure that whatever method is undertaken to dispose of the waste it does not cause more harm than would be caused by leaving it as it is. The work that has been done on this is not just going to benefit the Australian bases, but it is very much a cooperative effort and it will be picked up and used in conjunction with other work being done by other countries who have bases there as well. </para><para>It is a pristine area and it has significant beauty, but we have to be very conscious, careful and aware of what the impact of increasing tourism and issues like that could be on such an area. The recognition of the Madrid protocol is certainly going to help scientists and help the Antarctic to be preserved and to continue to be a very important source of landmass in the world with a number of very unique animals and unique flora that we cannot afford to lose.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>14244</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on the <inline ref="R961">Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline>, particularly Senator West for her valuable contribution while I was dealing with something else. First of all, I indicate that I rarely agree with Senator Mackay on anything, but I do agree with her on this occasion and with Senator Greig that the timing of our providing amendments in relation to rail in particular was very tardy. I am concerned that we were remiss in not making the other parties aware of those amendments in relation to rail, particularly because the rail amendments really do have to be passed now if they are going to be passed at all. They have to be passed because, although these amendments are relatively minor in their own right, they do affect the implementation of the AN sale arrangements. They have to be passed before the end of the financial year and now is the last opportunity. I apologise to the other parties for the late advice of those rail amendments. I certainly hope that in the time since the amendments were made known to the other parties, which was about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the department has been able to provide sufficient briefings to enable them to understand the import of them. It is a matter for me to try to convince them to agree or for them to point out where I am wrong. But I do hope at least that they understand and appreciate what the rail amendments are about and that they will have accepted that the amendments are relatively uncontentious and are needed to put the arrangements into operation. </para></talk.start><para>In relation to the industrial relations elements of the bill insofar as they relate to Christmas and Cocos islands, I again apologise for the late advising of the amendments that the government intends to move, amendments which arose out of debate in the House of Representatives and some unintended consequences of the way they were drafted. I am not sure of the Labor Party's position on the industrial relations elements. No doubt at some stage we will be made aware, although I understand that perhaps they have been looking more closely at them and perhaps my colleague Mr Reith, who deals with industrial relations matters on behalf of the government, has been speaking with the opposition spokesman for those areas. I hope that those issues are now clarified.  </para><para>I did not hear all of the speeches from all of the Labor Party senators. I did hear Senator Greig's speech, and I was just talking to him as the debate finished. I was emphasising to Senator Greig that, although he did not make a significant reference to these industrial relations matters in his speech, he did by implication indicate that he adopted some of the Labor Party senators' argumentsâthat is, he was not going to allow Christmas and Cocos island workers to be forced into becoming subject to Western Australian industrial relations laws, which Senator Greig described as terrible and draconian, I believe?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Rosemary (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Crowley)</inline>âFor the benefit of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, Senator Greig, you would have to speak. But I can tell <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that you nodded affirmation. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âHe was concernedâas I think some of the Labor Party senators wereâthat the import of our amendments made it mandatory for all employees on Christmas and Cocos islands to become subject to federal awards. That is definitely not the case. We are simple saying, at the request of the Western Australian government, that employees on Christmas and Cocos islands who are currently employed by Western Australia employersâprincipally by the Western Australian state governmentâhave the right to remain under the Western Australian industrial legislation. They will be able to stay where they are. Perhaps, in the committee stage, I will be clearer in my explanation of that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The situation as it currently applies on Cocos and Christmas islands is that the Commonwealth engages the Western Australian government to supply services to those islands, mainly because the Commonwealth does not have teachers, appropriate police officers, other allied health professionals and a lot of the other service providers. We simply engage someone else to do these jobs and, in this instance, it is the Western Australian state governmentâunder specific agreements we have made with various Western Australia state agenciesâwhich provides services on Christmas and Cocos islands. Those people who provide those services are Western Australian government employees. They have worked in Perth, or somewhere else in Western Australia, for the Western Australian government. They have been subject to Western Australian industrial relations legislation. There was a thought that perhaps, when they went to Christmas and Cocos islands, they would have to change to federal awards. This legislation, at the request of the Western Australian government, makes it quite clear that the situation which I think actually applies nowâthat is, they continue to be under Western Australian industrial relations lawsâis the position that remains.</para><para>That is really what the industrial relations section of the <inline ref="R961">Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999</inline> is all about. Whether or not you think the Western Australian laws are draconian or whatever other adjective you might like to give themâof course I would disagree with you, for the recordâreally, in this instance, is not relevant. We are not saying to workers in the Indian Ocean territories that they must now go under Western Australian law. We are saying, `You can stay under the federal law; if you want to change over to the Western Australian law, you can; if you have a WA based employer, you can if you want to.' We are certainly not saying that they have to, but it allows those Western Australian government employees who are currently under the Western Australian award to legitimately stay there.</para><para>I again accept, Senator Greig, from your point of view particularly, that you and I are not experts on industrial relations law at all and we struggle to understand some of the complexities of things that we are not normally comfortable with. I would not expect you to know those, as I hope people would not expect me to be an expert on those particular things. We have been trying to say to you, Senator Greigâand, as I indicated, we have been trying to get in touch with you since yesterday eveningâthat we can send along departmental peopleânot meâto brief you. Although I am a very honest and trustworthy person, I can accept that, at times, you may think I am giving a political spin, so I would not send me or my officers. But, if you would like to understand exactly what the provisions provide, please accept a briefing from departmental officials. Having got the briefing and having then understood exactly what is intended, it is then a matter for you and your party to determine what you are going to do. I would hate to think that you are making a decision on this bill on the basis of a misunderstanding of what the bill actually saysâa misunderstanding that I say, certainly in my own instance, would be very understandable because it is a complex matter in an area that I am not usually involved in. </para><para>I am assured, if I can repeat, that territory residents who choose to undertake employment with a Western Australian employer will, under the government's amendments, have the choice to enter an Australian workplace agreement or a federal agreement by agreement with their employer. Where the employment with an AWA employer would be covered by an AWA award, there would be a normal conservancy of the employment. The territory resident would still be able to seek their employer's agreement to a federal agreement provided the Western Australian employer is a corporation.</para><para>We do not accept, I might say for the record, the opposition's 1994 agreement with the Union of Christmas Island Workers that in fact dictated that private sector workers on Christmas Island could only be represented by the Union of Christmas Island Workers and could only be covered by federal awards or agreements. The same choices should apply for Western Australian employers and their employees when working in the IOTs as apply on the mainland. Again I say, in answer to Senator Greig, that the government is not seeking to impose Western Australian industrial legislation on anyone. Territories residents not employed by Western Australian employers will not be affected by these amendments and will retain their special access to the federal workplace relations system. Territory based employers will still work solely under the federal workplace relations system.</para><para>I hope that the issue of just what these amendments do is clarified. I accept and I repeat that I do empathise with the opposition parties because they have not had as much time as they would have liked to have a look at some of these things but I hope that the import is now clear and that both the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party senators would now be able to support that particular position.</para><para>To briefly recap on the import of the whole of this legislative package before the parliament, the purpose of the bill is to amend a number of acts to help rectify some operational and technical anomalies. The bill also allows for changes to gender specific language and for the correction of some typographical and drafting errors. Schedule 1 amends the commencement provisions of the Transport and Communications Legislation Act to overcome a technical difficulty which prevented a proclamation being made for the commencement of the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act. Those amendments relate to the discharge of sewage and the disposal of garbage from ships in Antarctic areas. As I heard the debate, I understand that all senators support that legislation and I thank them for that support so that we can deal with and implement the legislation in relation to the disposal of sewage and garbage in the Antarctic area.</para><para>Of schedules 2 and 3, one relates to the Christmas Island Act and one to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. Those amendments remove the reference to a court of Western Australia which has been abolished; make some changes in the industrial relations area, which I have already spoken about; and repeal some obsolete provisions relating to the removal and return to the territories of accused persons and prisoners. </para><para>Schedule 4 relates to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act, allowing for there to be a quorum even though a full-time executive member has disclosed a pecuniary interest in a particular issue and absents himself or herself from the meeting. I understand that all parties are supporting that very practical and sensible amendment.</para><para>Schedule 5 relates to the Northern Territory state government. I will very briefly enter into the political debate which happened yesterday. I am sure Senator Crossin would be disappointed if I did not take up some of her political points. I will briefly also mention a couple of points that Senator Greig made. I have already apologised for wrongly informing the Senate that the act had nothing to do with the Norfolk Island Act. It did, in fact: we are changing a full stop to a colon and including one word, `or'; so I was wrong. But really it will not in any way impact upon the Norfolk Island areas.</para><para>I appreciate what Senator Greig said about Norfolk Island, but he was really repeating what he said in the debate a few weeks ago on the attempt by the government to provide democratic reforms for those people living on Norfolk Island. I still cannot overcome my surprise that the Democrats particularlyâalthough I am surprised at the Labor Partyâwould object to a reform that made the Norfolk Island Assembly much more democratic than it now is. Senator Greig said that we do not consult enough with the territories, but I consult very regularly with the Norfolk Island government and the Chief Minister. I go across for formal intergovernmental meetings and I am going across on one again very shortly and taking some of my ministerial colleagues. We go out of our way to consult very closely with the Norfolk Island government and the parliament, and I reject any suggestion that we do not consult with them. I get across to the Christmas and Cocos islands as much as I canâwhich is not very often, I regret to say. I try to be there and consult with the locals on the ground as often as I am able. Of course, as I think Senator Greig mentioned, we do have an administrator there who is in constant contact with the people of Christmas and Cocos islands and understands their views.</para><para>Senator Crossin, Senator Greig and Senator Hutchins then had the very curious argument which, I think, with respect, smacks of the hypocrisy that sometimes is displayed by the Australian Labor Party and, to a degree, by the Democrats. First of all, they are saying that we should consult more with the territories, that we should do what they say and not try to impose the Commonwealth's will on Norfolk Island or Christmas Island, but that we should listen to what they say. But when it comes to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the people of those territories, who elect their own governments and whose governments then determine what things need to be done and we have to pass some legislation to enable those people to have their own say, suddenly the Democrats and the Labor Party say, `Oh no, we don't want to allow the Northern Territory's democratically elected assembly to have any say in this; we don't want the Australian Capital Territory's democratically elected assembly to have a say in this. We want the Commonwealth government to go over the top and to impose our will on them.'</para><para>In relation to parliamentary secretaries, as we indicated during the debate, it was a request from the former Chief Minister to introduce that, to allow that to happen if the democratically elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly so determined to appoint parliamentary secretaries. We are not appointing any parliamentary secretaries. That is up to the democratically elected government in the Northern Territory. We had a lot of humour and a bit of cynicism from the opposition senators yesterday about the Northern Territory assembly, but that is all because for 26 yearsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âFor 25 years.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âFor 25 yearsâthank you, Senator Mackayâthe Liberal Country parties in the Northern Territory have been returned, election after election after election, because they do what the local people want.

Senator Macdonald is rightâwe do rarely agree. But on this occasion I am totally aware of the fact that the unfortunate circumstance that occurred with respect to the rail amendments was out of his control. I understand from discussions with the shadow minister that there were several contacts between Minister Anderson's office and his office yesterday, in a very difficult period, obviously, because of the nature of the budget that was being brought down. I am advised by the shadow minister that we will now be supporting the rail amendments that the government has put forward, but I wish to emphasise the views of the shadow minister, which I understand were communicated in no uncertain terms to Minister Anderson's office, that this is no way to run a business. We appreciate the expeditious way that we must proceed, therefore we will be supporting the Australian National Railway Commission amendments.</para></talk.start><para>As to the second lot of amendments that deal with the industrial relations aspects, unfortunately, Senator Macdonald, there has been no briefingâand I appreciate this may also be out of your controlâas I understand it between Minister Reith's office and Mr Bevis's office in relation to this matter. We did make an offer yesterdayâI am not sure whether the Democrats are prepared to echo itâthat we defer some of these amendments to allow us time to consider them. We simply have not had time, because of the intervention of the budget, to consider them. It may well be that you are correctâthat some of the amendments that have been drafted since the House of Representatives debate do ameliorate some of our concernsâbut at this juncture we are not in a position to support the government amendments without a full briefing similar to the briefing you offered Senator Greig. So at this juncture we will be pursuing our amendments. Given the fact that we do not fully appreciate or understand the nature of the government's amendments, we cannot support them at this point if the government persists with the committee stage of this bill. I am sorry, but that is the way it is. I reiterate we did offer yesterday, both to Minister Macdonald's officeâand I appreciate this is not directly within their responsibilityâand directly in the chamber to adjourn after the second reading and reconsider the committee stage at a later point. This may still be possible; otherwise, unfortunately, we will be pursuing our amendments.</para><para>I wish to go to some of our amendments and reiterate what our concerns are, and, inter alia, I would like to raise a couple of questions that I would like the minister to consider and perhaps respond to. We are currently quite happy to support the agreement that was reached in 1994. That agreement was not simply with the Christmas Island Workers Union; it was with the ACTU, the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth. In 1994 that agreement involved all three parties, including the Western Australian government, and we had no difficulty with that. That agreement was to protect the entitlements of public sector workers on Christmas and Cocos islands. It is my understanding, and I have been advised by some of my colleagues, that the police on Christmas Island are Australian Federal Police and not provided by the Western Australian government. However, there are a number of other public sector workers that are employed on Christmas and Cocos islands through the service delivery agreements. We are quite happy to sign up to something that was negotiated and agreed to by those three parties, but this, in our view, goes substantially further than that. Clearly the minister takes the word of the Western Australian government in relation to this matter. All I can say on that is the Western Australian government has had a change of heart since 1994 and clearly wishes to extend the industrial relations powers further than that. </para><para>In a briefing that the minister was kind enough to organise with his territories department we asked a number of questions in relation to the 1994 agreement as to the nature of the correspondence that went between the Commonwealth, the ACTU and the Western Australian government at that point. The reason we asked that is that we wanted to pin down precisely what that agreement was. The minister in his written response said that he was advised that his department did not appear to have this correspondence, and I understand that in the briefing which I attended together with my colleague Martin Ferguson with the territories people they said that it might be in the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.</para><para>At this point I would assume that the department has had with the effluxion of time sufficient capacity and resources to have a look for that correspondence. We certainly would reiterate our request for that. It has been some time since the briefing occurred. We would like to ask again: where is the correspondence? I simply cannot understand why the department would not have copies of it. It was only 1994; we are not talking about 10 or 20 years ago. We would also like to know what the department or the minister's office did in order to confirm the terms of the earlier agreement. We were also seeking information with respect to that. We would also ask, as we did in the briefing, what negotiations in fact took place between the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth and the ACTU at that point, and what was the nature of those negotiations. I have a number of other questions, but I might leave it at that to allow the minister, Senator Greig or my other colleagues who are here to respond to questions that we have raised thus far.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>14249</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Senator Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Mackay has raised a number of issues. I cannot explain why the department cannot find the correspondence. It is almost six years ago now, and there was a previous government. I do not know what happened when the government changed. Perhaps some material found its way to a shredder or something! For the record, I do not say that seriously but simply to emphasise that I really cannot elaborate on that. I cannot throw any light on the question. I am advised by my department that they have not been able to locate that easily. I suspect that they probably have not turned over every piece of paper in the whole department looking for it, but it is not readily available. But again, Senator, whilst discussions that were held some time ago are of course important, I do not know that they would ever be taken to reach the status of a firm and binding agreement between the Commonwealth governmentâalbeit the then Commonwealth governmentâand various other parties. I understand that they were part of discussions which the government at the time perhaps thought were not a bad idea. There were things perhaps thought about being legislated that never quite happened. So I really cannot assist further in relation to that.</para></talk.start><para>Just dealing with the other matter that Senator Mackay raised about the industrial relations matters in the bill, I am going to proposeâand risk the wrath of the Manager of Government Business in the Senateâthat we should finish the committee debate insofar as all other matters are concerned and then report progress and adjourn the debate to enable some further discussions on the industrial relations elements. I say that becauseâand again I repeat myselfâit is a complex issue and difficult for me to follow easily, but it may well be that the amendment we are proposing finds real favour in the minds of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. If that is a possibility, then I think weâ </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>âExtend WA IR laws to the territories?

My understanding is that once the full import of the amendment we have just moved, and only gave you notice of yesterday afternoon, is confirmed it may well address some of the concerns that the Labor Party and the Democrats had. I am not sure whether you were here during my second reading speech, Senator Crossinâyou were?âbut I just was emphasising that it is really putting beyond doubt the situation which I think currently exists. In short, that is that Western Australian government employees working on the island can retain their Western Australian government awards. It does not apply to other workers on the territories. We are not forcing them under a Western Australian award. They can stay where they are, and I think there is no intention that they would move. It is simply at the request of the Western Australian government that Western Australian government employees who are only working temporarily in the Indian Ocean territories have the clear right to retain their Western Australian award status.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the possibility that that is accepted by the Labor Party and the Democrats it seems to me, for want of delaying the debate for a little while today or perhaps even until tomorrow, unfortunate if we have to get rid of that, if all parties are almost close to agreement. It is worth the delay to see if there is an agreement. Once the departmental officials can brief the Labor Party and the Democrats as to just what exactly it means, the other parties can inquire and can cross-examine the departmental people by themselves on just the import of these rules. If at the end of that cross-examination sessionâthat understanding sessionâthe parties still say, `We understand what all that means, but as a matter of policy we disagree,' we can vote them down and get on with the rest of the bill, which I would very much like to do either today or tomorrow because the other elements are important. But I think it is worth a little delay to just see how far apart we are on those matters.</para><para>So I propose that we deal with the other issues, apart from the industrial relations areas. I think we are in agreement on those issues, except for the issue of the parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territory. If the parties are against that, I might say that we are not going to die in a ditch over it. The current Chief Minister is not terribly concerned about it. What this legislation from the Commonwealth does is to simply enable the Northern Territory government to do what the Northern Territory government has decided to doâwhat the people of the Northern Territory, through their elected government, thought was right for the Territory. We are not providing for any number of parliamentary secretaries and we are not providing a salary for them. We are giving the Northern Territory parliamentâthe Northern Territory people through their elected parliament and governmentâthe right to say, `Okay, we do want parliamentary secretaries, we do want to pay them, we do want the Remuneration Tribunal to work out what they are worth and we do want to appoint another two or three, or however many there might be.' We are not going to appoint them; we are simply enabling the Northern Territory governmentâthe Northern Territory people through their elected governmentâto do that, if the Northern Territory people want that done. We are not doing it; we are giving them the right to do it should they want to.</para><para>I would hope that the other parties would accept that it is the right of the Northern Territory people through their properly elected parliament and their government to determine these things rather than the right of those of us sitting here in Canberra. All we want to do is to enable that. I would hope that the other parties would agree with that provision. Apart from that and the industrial relations matters, as I read the debate, all parties are agreed. It would be appropriate that we finish the debate on that, at the convenience of the Senate, and then perhaps adjourn to allow some further discussions to be held on those industrial relations amendments.

My questions to you then are: why has it taken nearly 15 months since the change of chief ministers for this legislation to come before the Senate, and why is the federal government not abandoning this pursuit of creating federal secretaries when it is not the will of the current Chief Minister?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>14253</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn absolute frankness, this was a request made by the then Northern Territory government of my predecessor. It is that long ago. Senator Crossin, you ask why it has taken that long to get this far. You have been around long enough to know how horribly difficult it is to get any legislation through this chamber in particular and through the parliament in general. Unless the bill has a classification that gives it great urgencyâand there are not a lot of thoseâthey are delayed for many years. You raise an exceptionally good point. The solution regrettably is not in the government's hands; it is in the hands of the senators who comprise the majority in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst I do not deny the cooperation of Labor and Democrat senators at times in getting those urgent bills through, I think anyone would concede that we do waste a great deal of time in the Senate. We waste a great deal of time on motions and discussions that are not related to legislation. It is for this reason that these types of bills get put on the list. I think this has been on the list for quite a long period of time. It does not take priority in drafting instructions. It does not take priority because we know what has to be done and what will fill up the time.</para><para>This is a request that was made to my predecessor by a former Northern Territory Chief Minister. It was put in the system. It is here now. I understand the current Chief Minister was asked about it and said, with absolute frankness, `No, it's got nothing to do with me. I don't know anything about it.' He was being perfectly frank and honest, as I know Mr Burke would be. He is a very honest and frank person. It then came to light that the request was activated. But you are quite right: I do not think it is a life and death issue for the current Northern Territory government. It is not something we are going to go to the wall on. If the Senate does not like it, let us vote it down and go on. But I do emphasise that we are not creating parliamentary secretaries. The federal parliament provides the constitution for the Northern Territory parliament. We are providing the wherewithal for the Northern Territory people to make the decision. We are not creating one new parliamentary secretary. It would be up to the Northern Territory government to do that, not us. We are simply saying, with this amendment, `If you want to do it, you can do it.' If it is voted down, it is voted down, and so be it. That is the democratic process.

As I understand, there is absolutely no urgency or request for this to happen. I then go to the fact that the Commonwealth supplies the Northern Territory with at least 80 per cent of their revenue. Let us say, for example, this amendment gets up and they do then choose to have five parliamentary secretaries. Will there be an obligation upon the Commonwealth to increase the funding to the Northern Territory government by virtue of revenue to pay the additional $100,000-plus that would be needed to pay these parliamentary secretaries? Will there be additional future revenue to the Northern Territory government or has the Commonwealth decided the allowance to be paid to these parliamentary secretaries will be found within existing revenue provided to the Northern Territory? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>14254</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Crossin, you ask the questions. I am not sure you do not know the answers. But let me elaborate. We provide the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory people, with a certain amount of money. They raise some revenue themselves. Because we believe in self-government and because we believe the Northern Territory people are first-rate Australians, not second-rate Australians, we believe the Northern Territory people do have the right and the ability to consider issues, to elect the representatives they want and to elect the government they want. We trust Northern Territorians. We treat them like other Australians. We do not say to them, `Look, we don't think you can make these decisions.' We say, `If you think mandatory sentencing is a good idea, we think you have the right to determine that.' We do not treat Northern Territorians as second-rate citizens.</para></talk.start><para>We give them an amount of money. If they decide to appoint extra parliamentary secretaries and to pay them big amounts of money or if they decide to increase the salaries of all parliamentarians of the Northern Territory, that is an issue for Northern Territorians. If the voting public do not like it, they will vote them out next time. We accept they have that democratic right. We accept they have the right to make those decisions. If they pay themselves more money, if they have a lot of new parliamentary secretaries and pay them big salaries, that means they have that much less money to spend on other things. But isn't it up to the Northern Territory people, voting in their election, to say to their parliamentarians, `Hey, we don't want you to spend this money on your salaries. We want you to spend it on some roads or some schools and, because you did the wrong thing, we're going to vote you out'? They have the right to do that. They do not need Big Brother down here looking after those things for them.</para><para>We give them a fixed amount. We are not going to increase revenue by one cent to the Northern Territory government to help them pay for salaries for their ministers and parliamentary secretaries. They will get the same amount of money. If the Northern Territory people decide to have parliamentary secretaries, to pay them a lot of money and to accept that the consequence is they will have less to spend on roads, that is a matter for Northern Territorians. It is not a matter for this chamber sitting down here in Canberra. We want to say to the Northern Territory people: `You want parliamentary secretaries. That's a decision for you to make. All we'll do is give you the âconstitutionalâ right to do that if you so choose. After that, it's up to you.'

So if they elect a government to do something, no matter how silly it is, it is a matter for the Northern Territorians. If another government says, `Look, we don't trust you to make these decisions,' then you are treating those people as second-rate Australians.

We were trying to say in that instance, `All Australians, no matter where they live, are entitled to the same democratic rights, and we as a federal parliament think those democratic rights should apply.'</para><para>Senator Greig also mentioned the fact, as I think Senator Hutchins did yesterday, that the Northern Territory government is top heavy. Again, that is a matter for the Northern Territory people to determine. If they think their government is top heavy, then they should vote it out. But for 25 years the people of the Northern Territory have, in my view, very sensibly returned the Country Liberal Party time after time after time and have rejected the Australian Labor Party time after time after time. So, generally speaking, the people of the Northern Territory are pretty happy with the way the Country Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory operates.

But I do not say that, because I leave that to Tasmanians to determine. I know that Tasmanians are able to make their decisions and, if they want to be top heavy, they will vote to be top heavy. The same should apply to the Northern Territory. If the people there want to be top heavy, it is up to them to determine that; it is not for the Commonwealth government here. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Mackay has indicated the Labor Party are not going to support this. There is another party here, but I think Senator Greig indicated earlier that he was not going to be supporting it. I am not going to prolong that debate.

All we were doing was enabling them; we are not appointing any more parliamentary secretaries. I will not prolong the debate. I am a realist.

Whilst other matters are being sorted out, I may make some comment in relation to the Tasmanian situation. I just want to correct a view of Senator Ian Macdonald's. Of course, the Labor Party as well went to the election with a policy for the reduction of numbers in Tasmania. I have to say that, when you go down to the Tasmanian parliament now, it is a very, very small affair indeed.

Great strides were made in relation to the reduction of numbers in Tasmania. Tasmanians recognised that they were over-governed, and they voted for the party that supported the reduction of numbers, which of course was the Labor Party, and we won. I do not think it was a good idea of Senator Macdonald's to use Tasmania as an example, I have to say, given that we have comprehensively won government there in a majority and we, of course, hold all five seats. So, yes, I think the Tasmanian people have exercised their democratic rights. I think they in fact have delivered a judgment on the coalition both at the state and the federal levels.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also wish to take up an interjection by my colleague Senator Quirke in relation to payment. He is correct; the Tasmanian members are not paid anywhere near as much as the Northern Territorian members. I admittedly was quite astoundedâand I regard it as salutaryâby the couple of speeches from Senator Crossin and Senator Hutchins in relation to the amount of money that NT parliamentarians are paid. As I understand it, they are paid the same as federal backbenchers. Were this amendment to be put through, my understanding is that the remuneration tribunal determinations would apply and would flow through, and the parliamentary secretaries in the Northern Territoryâthese are the two people Senator Hutchins outlined yesterday who did not already have jobsâwould potentially seek the full remuneration of $20,000-odd.</para><para>I believe that money is richly deserved by parliamentary secretaries here, I have to say, and we supported that. I think it has been an oversight in the past, given the workload of parliamentary secretaries, that those positions have not been the subject of some remuneration. But let us get real here: we are talking about the Northern Territory government. They should reduce their numbers. The Tasmanians have bitten the bullet. If they are paid the same amount of money as a federal MP, then I think, if the people were given a chance to vote on that, they may actually change it.</para><para>I do not wish to prolong this debate any further. I indicate to the chamber that I am seeking to give people time to sort out another matter, rather than just talking for the sake of it. I wish to indicate to the chamber againâand my colleague Senator Cooney may wish to make some brief comments as well in relation to this, if he would not mindâthat we will be opposing this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>14257</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI listened to Senator Ian Macdonald making the comparison between the territories and the state of Tasmania and talking about the operation of democracy. But the difference is that, if Tasmania does something in its parliament, we do not bring a bill up here. In other words, Tasmania acts as a self-contained state under the Constitution. </para></talk.start><para>The difficulty with the territoriesâand this bill is a great illustration of thisâis that the federal government keeps going in there, so we are now talking about making provisions for a parliamentary secretary in the government of the Northern Territory. We would never do that with the government of a state. We would never say, `We're going to bring this provision in to support one parliamentary secretary, two parliamentary secretaries or three parliamentary secretaries.' We would never do that with Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland, but we do it with the Northern Territory.</para><para>This parliament makes laws in reference to the laws that will operate on Christmas Island or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. That shows that the relationship is different. It also shows that this parliament can and does interfere, if you want to use that word, orâif you want to look at it in a different way from `interfering'âit does exercise its proper powers in relation to these territories. I just think that looking at Tasmania is not a fair comparison to make in this debate where it is the territories that are under the direct jurisdiction of the Commonwealth parliament that are concerned.

You would be aware, Chair, that an agreement was reached recently with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Burke, and our Prime Minister in relation to the issue of mandatory sentencing in the Territory and the way in which it was resolvedâand I say resolved in terms of a political resolution rather than a social or, I think, moral resolution.</para></talk.start><para>We know from the extraordinary evidenceâand some senators here in the chamber were direct or participatory membersâof the inquiry which was held into mandatory sentencing both in my home state of Western Australia and in the Territory. Ideally I would love this amendment to be able to approach both Western Australia and the Northern Territory but, because of the nature of the bill before us, it can only deal with the Northern Territory. So we come back to the issue of mandatory sentencing as it exists only there.</para><para>There is, I think, a strong feeling in the general community and certainly with the government that the issue of mandatory sentencing is over, that it is finished, it is complete and should no longer be dealt with because it has been finalised. We Democrats make the point that that is not the case, that mandatory sentencing still exists in this instance in the Northern Territory. It has not been repealed.</para><para>We know from the deal that was struck with the Chief Minister and the Prime Ministerâas Senator Crossin has mentionedâthat $5 million has been presented to the Northern Territory government for diversionary programs such that police themselves now have the discretionâand I am alarmed by that particular developmentâto determine which juvenile offenders they believe are worthy of discretionary programs and which offenders should actually be prosecuted under the mandatory sentencing proposals. The deal also included the notion that the definition of `juvenile' be changed so that it would mean youths under the age of 18 years. In addition to that, an interpreter service was provided so that indigenous youths would have the opportunityâwhich, alarmingly, they do not have nowâto have somebody to speak to in their own tongue if and when they were prosecuted under the mandatory sentencing laws within the Northern Territory. As I said, there is more money for discretionary programs and a special juvenile court has been established. But that was the wrong answer to what is clearly a difficult question. </para><para>When the particular announcement was made that that deal had been struck, a number of commentators at state and federal levels had much to say on it. I refer here to a press release of Monday, 10 April, from Dr Gordon Hughes, President of the Law Council of Australia, in which he says:</para><quote><para>The Law Council of Australia has said that today's joint announcement by the Prime Minister, Hon. John Howard MP, and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Denis Burke MLA, is simply âwindow-dressingâ and does not substantially address, in any way, mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory.</para></quote><para>The press release goes on to state:</para><quote><para>âThis is simply political window-dressing which, on the face of it, vests more power in the Territory's police forceâ said the President of the Law Council, Dr Gordon Hughes. âThe real remedyâ</para></quote><para>he arguesâ</para><quote><para>would have been to abolish mandatory sentencing, and to restore judicial discretion to judicial officers, in sentencing matters.</para></quote><para>It was interesting also that, during that particular debate and prior to that deal being struck, Sir Ronald Wilson, who has a long and commendable history in working on these indigenous issues, in discussions I had with him argued quite strongly that both Western Australia and the Northern Territoryâand I stress that we are dealing only with the Northern Territory hereâbreached the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Treaty on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. I am not convinced, by any stretch of the imagination, that that particular scenario has changed on the basis of the deal that has now been struck, because the laws are still on the statutes. Sir Ronald argued also that the Northern Territory was in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights simply because of the arbitrary nature of sentencing. Mandatory sentencing in my home state applies after three strikes and only after break and enter offencesâand this can range from stealing a biscuit from the fridge to bashing the occupants of the houseâand there is no judicial review.</para><para>The argument that mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory assists victims of crime, which is a common call from the Chief Minister, is quite simply false. It obscures the fact that those jailed simply go to the `university of crime', as it were, and are most often destined to reoffendâoften with more serious offences. The use of section 122 of our federal Constitution makes it very clear that the Commonwealth can legislate for the territoriesâand there has been some argy-bargy debate here today on the issue of the voluntary euthanasia bill where the government felt quite enamoured of, and were quite enthusiastic about, stepping into that particular debate and invalidating that proposal by the Territory.</para><para>In summary, Sir Ronald Wilson was telling me some months ago that the Northern Territory clearly breaches international human rights treaty obligations in relation to the mandatory sentencing laws on its statutes. The Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, which has passed this chamber, is clearly constitutionally valid and there is no solid legal, moral or social argument to separate the issues in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</para><para>It was interesting that, on the day that particular deal was struck, there was a joint press release from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Chief Minister Burke in which they said that they had discussed the issues of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister expressed the Commonwealth's particular concern about the practical impact of that policy on juveniles and then went on to explain the particular scenario which unfolded in terms of how he was going to address that. Frankly, the only good thing to come from that is the fact that the Northern Territory legislation has been amendedâand I quote from the Prime Minister's own press release:</para><quote><para>... so that a person will be treated as an adult from 18 years of age rather than 17 years at present.</para></quote><para>It continues, and this is the particular point I want to make:</para><quote><para>Apart from this, the mandatory sentencing provisions of the existing law will remain unchanged. </para></quote><para>So I take this opportunity today, and I will continue to take every opportunity where it arises, to remind both the Senate and the electorate at large that this issue is not over. It is not finished. Mandatory sentencing still exists in the Northern Territory, and I plead to the Senate today to support this amendment such that the Territory government would no longer have the right or jurisdiction to create or impose such laws.

It is very difficult for me to even obtain instructions from the relevant minister in relation to this element of what is obviously an omnibus bill. I am not even sure what the government's position on this might be, Senator Greig. I would have thought, and can I suggest to you, that this is an inappropriate way to deal with what many people and obviously you consider to be a very, very serious and major issue. There are other ways to deal with this particular piece of material.</para></talk.start><para>I am not even sure of the constitutional validity of this type of amendment. I understand that it is very similar to a private member's bill that is currently before the chamber. I have not followed it that closely, but there are private member's bills around, there are other bills around, and I make no comment on whether they are within standing orders because I simply do not know. But, because we have not been given sufficient time to adequately determine this, it does become very difficult to debate the issue as it now stands. Senator Greig, if it is an important issue, as I accept you genuinely believe it is, one would have thought that it is an issue which should be properly debated by people who are properly briefed on the issue. I am not properly briefed, and I cannot enter into the substantive debate.</para><para>If perchance this amendment were to achieve majority support in the Senate, the impact of that would be that the bill would be rejected in the House of Representatives.

You are aware from the previous discussions that we have had about the other matters that are germane to this particular bill that there are some time sensitive elements of this bill which we were hoping to deal with in a way that suited you and the Labor Party senators by 30 June, and I repeat that they are the rail amendments. If perchance this amendment were to achieve support in the Senateâand of course I do not know how the Senate will vote on itâit could mean there are delays which could then impact upon a number of other important issues in this bill which are very time sensitive. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âBut what is the agreed timing on the third reading of the bill?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âBecause there are some elements of industrial relations legislation which are yet to be clarified because we were a fraction tardy in providing the sorts of briefings to both the Labor Party and the Democrats that would clarify those issues on the industrial relations, the scheme we had more or less agreed to in the chamber was that we would deal with the rest of the debate.

If the debate on this drags on, if it encourages further debate in the other chamberâthese are all things I am unaware ofâwe could find that we will be in a position where the time critical elements of this bill in relation to railways will not be implemented in sufficient time to allow proclamation by 30 June. That is my concern. This is a serious issue. It is one about which a number of senators obviously feel very strongly. In recognition of that, perhaps it is an inappropriate place for this debate. Perhaps this debate should be held at a time when everyone has notice of it, when people who have an interest in it are fully briefed and able to sensibly debate the issue, which, as I indicated to Senator Greig previously, I am not. Because of the lateness of the notice, I am not sure the government has yet taken a position on the particulars of Senator Greig's amendment. I certainly have not had a chance to look through it.

That is a process question that the minister might care to address. I will be interested in his response. </para></talk.start><para>Let me say something about the substantive amendment before the chair that stands in the name of Senator Greig, who has moved that amendment on mandatory sentencing on behalf of the Australian Democrats. As I hear the debate, I understand that Senator Greig circulated this particular amendment after question time yesterday. I think the point the minister makes about there being limited time to examine the amendment might be a reasonable one. I think the weakness in the minister's argument in this instance is that it does appear that the government is not without fault in this area itself. So that tends to diminish the strength of the minister's argument in that particular area. I have certainly looked as closely as I can at Senator Greig's amendment in the time that has been available to me. I make the point that I think it appears to be consistent with the position that the Labor Party has taken on the mandatory sentencing issue in this parliament. I do not have any doubt that that is the case. I am so advised and I am certainly willing to accept the advice that I have been given in relation to the policy question that is before the chair.  </para><para>However, this does raise one other substantive pointâand that is, the appropriateness or otherwise of having such a debate in this sort of legislation, and there is an issue for the chamber in relation to that particular matter. I think we have to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of dealing with the mandatory sentencing issue in portfolio bills such as the one we have before the chamber at the moment. I think this is a matter for all senators to give serious consideration to. Sure, you can have a range of parliamentary tactics that bring forward serious matters of public debate, but I think we have already seen in the way that the very important public issue of mandatory sentencing has been dealt with and moved as an amendment to this legislation that it has not achieved the same level of parliamentary focus or scrutiny that has been the case with other legislation that has been brought before the chamber on behalf of senators in the opposition, the Australian Democrats, through Senator Greig, and Senator Brown, who has also sponsored legislation in this chamber. I think that is the difficulty we are grappling with in this debate. </para><para>Simply put from the opposition's perspective: yes, we fundamentally agree with the sentiments and spirit of the amendment that Senator Greig has moved. For that reason, we would support such an amendment. But I make this serious point to the chamber: we have to look at the appropriateness of dealing with the mandatory sentencing issue in this way. I think you could sustain a strong case that it is too important an issue just to tack it on to a portfolio bill such as the one we are debating now. I do not think it is achieving the level of consideration it deserves in the chamber as a result. </para><para>I think it is something that the federal parliamentary Labor Party would want to examine in terms of its appropriateness as a parliamentary tactic, because I have concerns about that. I would not want to see every portfolio bill in Senator Macdonald's area of ministerial responsibility have an amendment about mandatory sentencing, when the Senate has expressed its view on, and has had serious and focused debates on, this issue with legislation before the chamber on other occasions. So that is the balance. It is not an easy balance to determine what the appropriate course of action is.</para><para>I think this is something that Senator Greig might give some consideration to in the future. No doubt this is a matter that the Australian Democrats will focus on but, as far as the opposition is concerned, yes, our position on this issue is clear. It is clear, and we have been consistent on it. And we will be consistent on it again today. As a result, we will support the amendment that stands in Senator Greig's name, but we will need to examine seriously how we will deal with this issue, given our clear commitment and position in relation to the mandatory sentencing issue. We will need to examine the appropriateness of this debate being dealt with via the vehicle of portfolio bills in Senator Macdonald's area of ministerial responsibility. I think it is fair to say, and I think Senator Mackay has been considering this issue, that we will have a look at that. I know Senator Crossin, my colleague from the Northern Territory, has a very strong interest in this issue also. We will look at that, but we do not want anyone to be under any illusions as this debate progresses today about Labor's commitment on this issue, and that is why we will take the position to support the amendment before the chair. </para><para>I make clear to all senators in the chamber that all of us in this chamberânot just the Labor Partyâare going to need to look at what this might mean in terms of other legislation and this legislation that has come before the chamber, given that the parliament has now had a number of opportunities to debate and consider legislation on mandatory sentencing in detail. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we will consider that in the time that is available; and that will be somewhat easier to do because it does appear, in this case, that even the third reading of this bill has been delayed somewhat. It is not going to alter our voting behaviour in relation to the amendment before the chair, because, as I said, our position is clear. I do not want our position to be misunderstood and I certainly do not want our position in any sense to be misrepresented, but this is not the best and most appropriate vehicle to debate the question of mandatory sentencing. </para><para>I would commend anyone who is thinking about the strength of this argument to consider the nature of the debate in the chamber today. It has not received the attention and focus that we have given this really important issue previously. This is one of the most important public policies issues on the political agenda in this nation, and it deserves appropriate consideration. We ought not belittle the debate in any sense by tacking it on to all the portfolio bills that come through in this area. I think the Senate will have to consider that in the time available to it in the future. Let no-one misunderstand our commitment: we will be supporting the amendment, and that is of course consistent with the position that the federal parliamentary Labor Party has taken on this matter now for many months.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>14263</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Senator Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI accept the position of the Labor Party.

It would appear, if it is voted on today, that it is going to be voted on without any real debate at all and without any government speaker having a substantive view on the matters before the chamber. As I indicated before, I am the only government speaker listed to speak. I am not going to debate the issue because I am not fully briefed on it. It is not something in my portfolio, so it is not something that I have some independent expertise on.</para></talk.start><para>Even if the amendment is passed, it is passed in a pretty second-rate way, if I may say so: without proper debate, without any alternative arguments being put, and in such a way that it is tagged on to a bill that is very time sensitiveâa bill that perhaps in some people's minds does not have the same human rights element. That is not my sentiment, but I know that other people have that sentiment. The bill that it is attached to it is fairly much a machinery bill but a very important one dealing with the sale of Australian National and things that have to be done by 30 June. Whatever happens with this, it is going to be squeezed at both ends because of the time sensitive nature of other elements of this very omnibus bill. It has caught the government by surprise and, as I and Senator Faulkner said, I cannot berate you for that, Senator Greig. I can only say again that, because it has caught the government by surprise and because we have no position on it and there are no speakers here to debate the substantive part of the bill, it seems a very inappropriate way to deal with the legislation.</para><para>Senator Faulkner asked me some questions about the processes. He obviously thought my answers would not be worth listening to, because he has left. In any case, the questions were perhaps rhetorical, since he would have a better understanding of the processes of the parliament than I would. If you want an expert opinion on that you may speak to the Clerks; or perhaps Senator Campbell, our Manager of Government Business, could give a better indication of the processes. But let me have a go at it, in attempting to answer Senator Faulkner's questions.</para><para>As I understand it, what has been arranged is that when we have dealt with these amendments in committee we will report progress. We will then at a later stage deal with the industrial relations elements of the bill, in a very speedy fashion. We will be more or less be giving either a yes with a 10- or 20-minute explanation or a no with a 10- or 20-minute explanation, and it will be finished. The committee will then report and, whatever the decision in relation to the IR bill, the committee's report will be adopted. It will then go to a third reading here and then back to the House of Representatives, because there is an amendment which the government has introduced which has not yet been dealt with by the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives would, we would hope, then adopt the government's amendment, and it would then come back here and be dealt with relatively perfunctorily and would pass. </para><para>But if we are involving this element of the mandatory sentencing amendment of Senator Greig's, then we do not know what is going to happen. We do not know what is going to happen in the House of Representatives; we do not know what is going to happen in this chamber. While Senator Greig, Senator Mackay and I are involved in the processional part of this debate, there are other senators in the chamber who may not share our views on the timeliness or otherwise. There is Senator Harradine, Senator Harris and Senator Brownâall of whom may have a very different view on what happens processionally after thisânot that I worry about that too much, except that it then impacts on the time sensitive nature of the rail amendments. We could find ourselves in July still debating this amendment when the rail amendments have reached their use-by date. Even if we voted on this today, assuming there were no other speakers, that still does not alter the fact that when it comes back from the House of Representatives it opens up a whole new opportunity for all senatorsânot just the Democrats, the Labor Party and the Liberal Partyâto debate it. We may find, as I say, that we are out of order in the whole thing.</para><para>Because of the fact that little notice was given and the government is not prepared, the best way to deal with this might be to report progress before a vote is even had on this particular elementâunless of course Senator Greig were convinced that he should withdraw it and bring it on in some other form on some other day. But he is not convinced of that, and so perhaps we should report progress now, before any vote is taken on this amendment, and deal with the industrial relations elements as we have already discussed. Perhaps those who are more involved in this aspect of the omnibus bill could then have a talk and see which is the right way to deal with it. That might be the best way to proceed at this time.</para><para>I accept, and again I repeat, that Senator Greig is very genuine about this. It is something that I know he has had a longstanding commitment to. I accept that the Labor Party, as Senator Faulkner has announced, is very committed to the thrust of this policy issue. I certainly do not in any way suggest that, by deferring it, either the Democrats or the Labor Party or anyone else is resiling from a position which they genuinely hold. But I do think that, in the interests of getting through this parliament a bill which is machinery and which deals with a number of minor but very important issues that are time sensitive, perhaps it is better at this stage to defer the committee stage later to deal with this matter again when the IR matter is determined, hopefully in the week beginning 5 June, and that in the meantime the parties and the Independent senators can determine which is the best way to proceed with this particular issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>14264</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have only recently focused on this. I apologise to the committee. I did not realise that the mandatory sentencing matter was going to be debated here. I understand the amendment was foreshadowed or distributed sometime yesterday. I really feel that if we are going to move such an amendment now we have the opportunity to do it properly and to cover the people that need to be covered; not only the children but also those peopleâparticularly, as it so happens, Aboriginal people in their late teens and early twentiesâwho are the main recipients of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory. The committee will recall that on the last occasion I asked why use the external affairs power, which only limits your ability to cover mandatory sentencing of children. Why not utilise the territories power and cover the situation of those young people who are not children but who are 17, 18, 19 or 20, for example, who are most affected by the mandatory sentencing laws of the Northern Territory? </para></talk.start><para>A principle is a principle. If the principle is that mandatory sentencing is an unjustified attempt by the executive to interfere with judicial prerogative, then that is a principle that should apply not only to children but also to late teenagers, for example. I understand the reason that was given for utilising the external affairs power because of the rights of the child convention. But now we have an opportunity here to fix it up properly. Clearly the legislation that is before us is founded on the territories power. That is the constitutional power which vests this parliament with the right to pass legislation in respect of the territories. We do not do it often, but we have done it in the past. I recall one instanceâto overturn the Territory's euthanasia legislation. I am supporting the minister's proposal to report progress for reasons other than those he might have. I would do that to try to fix up the amendments so as to cover the situation while we have got the chance.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14265</page.no><id.no>R1008</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGEâFRINGE BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1009</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>14265</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>a new tax system (fringe benefits) Bill 2000</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>14265</page.no><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 is not regarded by the government's advisers as a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution. The bill however results in taxpayers paying significantly more taxation, and the government amendments to the bill have been circulated as requests. </para></talk.start><para>The only basis for the amendments being requests would be that the bill imposes taxation. In the past government advisers have framed amendments as requests where they increase the amount of taxation payable under a bill on the basis of the third paragraph of section 53. That paragraph refers to Senate amendments not increasing any proposed charge or burden on the people, but for amendments to fall within that paragraph there must be a proposed charge or burden on the people to be increased. In other words, in the case of a tax bill it must be imposing higher taxation on taxpayers. It would probably best reflect the past decisions of the Senate in relation to the tax legislation if the bill was regarded as a bill imposing taxation and therefore the amendments treated as requests. Any other amendments moved to the bill will be treated as requests on that basis.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>14265</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and a replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

I do not know whether Senator Macdonald is handling this bill or if he is just filling in while the minister responsible enters the chamber. I guess if I speak for a couple of minutes it might allow him to find that out as well. As I understand it from reading the press release, these amendments reflect an agreement reached between the government and the Democrats regarding changes to the <inline ref="R1008">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000</inline>. I assumed that first the government and/or the Democrats would want to speak and explain the package to the parliament. I was intending to respond to those comments in terms of the debate about quite substantial amendments to the bill. I am not sure whether Senator Macdonald was aware that he was going to be providing that sort of explanation or not, but obviously it is important legislation. It is legislation that has been subject to a number of changes in policy and a great deal of public debate. So I am just a little surprised. I understand that there may be a minister other than Senator Macdonald handling it, but I suspect that Senator Murray might want to say something, and I do not know whether Senator Woodley would. It was my intention to respond to those contributions. I would like some guidance from Senator Macdonald as to who is handling the bill and whether there is any explanation to be provided.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14267</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy expertise on this is great, and I would have looked forward to look explaining it and entering into the debate, but I see my colleague Senator Kemp is here.

I thought that in fact the debate had moved on. Perhaps my rapid praise for my colleague was too fulsome too early. I had been tied up elsewhere. But let me, first of all, make some general comments, as requested by the shadow minister. The <inline ref="R1008">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000</inline> implements the second phase of the government's tax reform package for fringe benefits. The bill will provide consistent FBT treatment between public and non-profit hospitals. Those hospitals which are currently eligible for 48 per cent rebate will have the rebate replaced by the exemption provided to public hospitals that are public benevolent institutions.</para></talk.start><para>With effect from 1 April 2000 the bill will cap certain fringe benefits eligible for concessional treatment to $17,000 grossed up taxable value for employees of public and private not-for-profit hospitals. With effect from 1 April 2001 the bill will cap certain fringe benefits eligible for concessional treatment to $30,000 grossed up taxable value for employees of all public benevolent institutions that are not hospitals or where the employer is a rebatable employer. These caps do not place a limit on the use of other FBT exempt benefits, such as superannuation minor benefits less than $100, laptop computers, work related mobile phones and other miscellaneous benefits. Further, the concessional methods of valuing certain benefits will also increase the total value of benefits that can be provided without breaching the cap.</para><para>The bill will also extend the application of the current FBT exemption for remote area housing benefits for primary producers to all employers. In addition, the bill gives an exemption from FBT for housing benefits provided by public and non-profit hospitals, charities and police services in a place which is at least 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 or more people. This enhances the delivery of health, charitable and police services to communities in regional Australia. The bill will also allow an FBT exemption to primary producers in remote areas for most meals provided to their employees.</para><para>Finally, the bill introduces a new FBT gross-up formula to help neutralise the tax treatment between fringe benefits and cash salary following the introduction of the GST, ensuring that the GST law interacts properly with the FBT law. The <inline ref="R1009">A New Tax System (Medicare Levy SurchargeâFringe Benefits) Amendment Bill 2000 </inline>will make minor technical corrections to the <inline ref="R1009">A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 1999</inline> to ensure consistency between the Medicare levy surcharge imposed under that act and the additional Medicare levy imposed under the Medicare Levy Act 1986. </para><para>Of all senators on the opposition benches, I think Senator Evans has had a long interest in this issue. I well remember being pressed by Senator Evans at Senate estimates and other hearings about the concessional treatment that was available, particularly in the hospital area. I give credit to Senator Evans.

You will have that recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. This issue has, I think, been very extensively debated in this chamber. I think the Labor Party went to an election with a policy and, given the political pressures, it was not possible in the end for Labor to sustain that policy. We of course had negotiations with the Democrats, who, I might say, put some views to us. In the end I think Senator Woodley and Senator Murray will probably be happy to say that their particular concerns have been accommodated by the changes that are in this bill and by the further amendments that have been brought forward. I do think, if I may say so, it is now timeâand I very much welcome Senator Evans's comments that the Labor Party will not be opposing these amendmentsâto pass this bill. I think it is important that we get this bill through the parliament now to give certainty to people. I urge senators to allow the speedy passage of this important bill, a bill which I might say has had a very difficult birth but is now here before the chamber.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>14268</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will make a reasonably lengthy contribution now rather than speaking at every point because I think that will hopefully cover the rest of the debate. Let me begin by also placing on record my appreciation of the contribution of Senator Evans. Although the discussions were held between the government and us, he was aware of those and, as much as I could tell himâwhich was not muchâI did try to keep him informed of what was happening.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âWe thought the discussions were confidential, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âThey were confidential in terms of any detail, Senator Kemp, but, in terms of the broad scope of what was happening, I kept Senator Evans informed, simply because he has been very responsible in all of the debates on this issue. I also want to commend him for keeping on the record the idea of a Senate inquiry into this issue, because I think that was one of the things that prompted the government to finally agree to an independent inquiry. That might have been a catalyst along the way, so that was helpful. Let me also say that on the part of the government I believe they have acted responsibly in agreeing to the propositions we put to them. Let me outline in brief some of the agreements that we reached with the government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I suppose I am only reiterating what Senator Kemp said, but I did want to underline the fact that we convinced the government that the cap of $17,000 on charities should be increased to $30,000 and that they should extend the start-up date for that cap to 1 April 2001. As I have said, one of the most critical things in all of this was that the government agreed to institute an independent inquiry into the whole definition and tax treatment of charities. We have yet to agree on the terms of reference and on the people for that inquiry, but I can inform the government that we have been working on this and I believe we will have some words ready for them this week. I also add that, as part of that, there is a particular problem with indigenous communities and indigenous service bodies. This problem is to do with the fact that, because of the cuts in government funding over a period of time to indigenous organisations, they have used the fringe benefits tax concession more than anyone elseâthey have been forced to do so. For example, Aboriginal medical services are able to fund the provision of doctors up to about $70,000âwhich I think this chamber would understand is way below what a doctor would expect, particularly in a remote areaâso they have often doubled that in terms of using the fringe benefits tax concession. </para><para>We need, as part of an inquiry, a particular emphasis on the needs of indigenous communities and indigenous organisations. The government has agreed that Dr Wooldridge and ATSIC will monitor that. I am not sure how that will be done, but I am also writing to Dr Wooldridge about some suggested terms of reference for that particular aspect of the inquiry. I have suggested to him that the Hall Chadwick study of Aboriginal medical services in the Northern Territory, which I believe was funded by the government, was a very good model that the government might be prepared to endorse for a wider overview of all indigenous organisations and that that would fulfil the agreement we have. In terms of the charity not-for-profit sector, the Democrats are very pleased that the government has agreed to the measures we brought before it and that these amendments will proceed to enable those measures to be put in place. My leader is going to cover the medical aspects, so I thank the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>14269</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to specifically address the section of the bill that relates to the hospital system. My colleague Senator Woodley has done an outstanding job in his negotiations with the charitable sector, making sure that their needs are met. This area falls within my portfolio. We have been concerned for some time about the way in which packaging was basically spiralling out of control. Obviously, something had to be done. It had been accepted by successive governments as a legitimate way of states meeting the needs of their hospital systems. I want to stress here that I believe the Commonwealth did not help by not funding hospitals adequately. The level of funding for our hospitals now is almost to the level where they cannot even upgrade essential equipment, and basic maintenance cannot be done. You can understand the states finding a mechanism and using it quite widely, but now it has got to the point where we are not talking just about doctors being packaged; we are also talking about nursing staff, and I understand that in some hospitals it is down to the groundsmen.</para></talk.start><para>We had to look at this issue. However, we could not have looked at the issue and with just one stroke of the pen made the changes that the Commonwealth wanted to make. The Commonwealth, as I said, has to carry some responsibility for the fact that salary packaging has gone on year after year without any intervention. Yes, we had to look at the issue, and once we looked at what the states were doing the end result was a compensation package of $240.5 million over three years. We are now looking to government to give us some further undertakings on the process and the mechanism of how that division will be made.</para><para>The aim of the compensation is to ensure that salaries do not fall. Obviously, there will be some adjustments made by hospitals under the new arrangements with the lower cap. In some instances, hospitals, particularly the hospitals that are not yet using it fully, will probably decide to extend packaging out. That will help to balance, for example, the impact of their top surgeons being heavily packaged. That packaging now has to be brought back to a more reasonable level, with the money to compensate the doctor so she or he does not lose any real income. Over time, the states will obviously have to pick up the bill. This package is designed to soften that process so that there is no loss of income by the doctors.</para><para>As of this financial year, group certificates are required to include data on the value of fringe benefits being provided. Hospitals are required to provide group certificates to the ATO by 14 August this year. The total value of reported fringe benefits from group certificates will be representative of the total future FBT costs faced by hospitals. We actually have a mechanism already in place where we can track where FBT is being used and how extensively it is being used. This data could be used to distribute the compensation funding on a pro rata basis to the hospitals that are actually using it. </para><para>Our main concern with the mechanism is that it should get the money through to the people who are now being packaged and it should be transparent so that all of us can see how it is working and where the money is going. As you can imagine, there are some real concerns in the medical community that state governments will somehow manage to absorb parts of it, that it will go back into that great black hole of state budgets and not be seen in full. I think it is essential that the government today put down more details of its processes and what it believes should be done so that the people affected by the FBT changes can be confident that the package of money will be equitably distributed and that they will not be losing any income at all and their salaries will stay at the current level. I am calling on the government now to give an explicit commitment that the mechanism for compensation will reassure us and the medical community that the stakeholders will receive their fair share and that we will not see any adverse impact on our public hospital system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>14270</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make a few remarks to respond to the comments of the minister and the Democrats and to put the Labor Party position on the record. I think it was important that we had that more general debate because of the history of this legislation and the changes that have occurred since its original introduction. Otherwise, I think people reading the second reading speeches might get completely the wrong impression of what we are passing here today. A lot has changed between then and now.</para></talk.start><para>First of all, I would like to thank the minister and Senator Woodley for their kind remarks. I feel a bit out of sorts. I am much more used to being abused, and it is much more comfortable because you know where you stand. This is very unnerving. I knew when Senator Woodley made reference to me in his press release that it would cause me no end of grief with my colleagues. Thank you for that, Senator Woodley. I am not sure whether or not it was a calculated move to try to ensure Labor's support for the agreement, but I appreciate the remarks. Seriously, Senator Woodley and I have both had a long interest in this issue since we entered the parliament, and we both remarked on the old Productivity Commission report when it came down in 1995. I was one of those then urging the Labor government to do something about what was a potential explosion in these things. I have said that before. From that period on, we saw rapid growth in the use of the FBT concession. I think it is fair to say that it was a fairly small problem at that stage and it became a much bigger problem. That is why we have supported the government's attempt to put some accountability and transparency into the system, to put a cap on and to have proper reporting. The major flaw in what has occurred is the way it has been done. People got a wink and a nod from the tax office and thought that, provided they did not package more than 30 per cent, the tax office would not go through their books with too fine a toothcomb and that, if they went over that, they were fair game.</para><para>That is not a proper way to implement public policy. We needed transparency in the regulations and guidelines for not-for-profit and charitable organisations and anybody else eligible for concession. We did not have that. The key issue in this debate was that proper regulation. A whole range of people did not take advantage of some of the measures they could have taken advantage of, because it was not clear to them that it was legal or appropriate. Others quite frankly abused the opportunity by going through at a million miles an hour with all guns blazing to take full advantage of what was seen as a bit of a loophole. We had, therefore, an inconsistent application across the industry and a lot of concern from many people about whether they were doing something that was legally and morally appropriate. Organisations had real debates about that and, because of the squeeze on funding from both Commonwealth and state sources and because of the difficulties of fundraising, those were very difficult debates for a lot of organisations. </para><para>The key thing to come out of this is that we get some accountability and transparency, a cap and a proper regulation in the system. What has been lacking is proper information about what the appropriate cap is. While I accept that the Labor Party have moved from this position, since about August last year we argued for a full public inquiry. We are not able to get good hard information about the extent of the use of the FBT concession and the impact of the FBT concession's capping or removal on those organisations. There is not a lot of hard data around. There is not a lot of evidence to support the argument as to the various proposed caps. For instance, the government has moved from a $17,000 cap to a $30,000 cap on not-for-profit organisations. What is the justification for $17,000 versus $30,000? The point is that no-one really knows. I do not even think we are sure about what the impact of the Commonwealth's revenue will be as a result of these changes.</para><para>We always argued from the first principle of having an inquiry, which would establish the costs, the benefits, the current practice and the impact of various measures. That has not happened, and we are now dealing with the legislation without that proper information. That is just the way it has evolved. That is politics. We would have preferred that way; we argued for that approach. That has not occurred. We accept that the Democrats and the government came to an arrangement based on the need for the government to get on with the legislation, their need to progress, and the Democrats and othersâlike the Labor Partyâwere looking to protect the not-for-profit sector from what would have been quite adverse effects from the original proposition. We accepted that, after some evidence during the GST inquiry, there would be serious adverse effects for the not-for-profit and charitable sector as a result of the original proposition, and we accepted that we did need to move and that the Labor Party needed to change their policy and look at ways of protecting those organisations from adverse impacts.</para><para>It is not our preferred route, and we were not party to the final arrangement between the government and the Democrats. But I have, as Senator Woodley would acknowledge, tried to work with Senator Woodley to get a better outcome. I appreciate his cooperation, although I do want to put on the record that he did not breach any government confidentiality, despite my working hard on him. One of the key things that comes out of this is the delay until next year. That is important, because the not-for-profit sector were in a position of not knowing what was going to occur, and it would have been a complete shambles. A whole range of people who were salary packaged in both the public system and the not-for-profit system were going to have to have their whole salary arrangements renegotiated in a very short time and without proper information. It would have been very stressful for a lot of people, stressful on organisations and very poor industrial relations. So the delay is important. The one good argument against the inquiry, given the lateness of the debate, is that this now at least gives people almost a full year to plan for the changes. We would have preferred the inquiry route. We argued for it. We accept that is not going to occur.</para><para>I do acknowledge that the amendments moved today and the arrangement between the government and the Democrats have produced a better outcome for the not-for-profit sector. Whether it is the best public policy is the key issue, and I am not trying to be overcritical or make a political point. But, because we did not have the inquiry and because we did not have the full information, no-one knows the full public policy implications of this. That is, therefore, a bad public policy outcome. It would have been better to do it the other way around, but I do accept that this deal provides a much better outcome for charities and the not-for-profit sector. That is obvious. It takes the pressure off and gives them transparent and accountable guidelines for dealing with the concession.</para><para>I want to note that, with the arrangements for public hospitals, I share some of the concerns that Senator Lees just raised. I was a bit concerned when she raised them, because she signed up to the deal, and she seemed to be raising the very questions that I had about how it is all going to work. Given that the arrangements for the FBT concession's use in public hospitals has varied from state to state and hospital to hospital, we do need to understandâI am not clear in my own mindâhow this compensation package is to be administered. I, like her, want to ensure that it does get through to the intended recipients and that it is used for the purposes identifiedâthat is, to allow them to continue to employ good quality staff and to compete with other providers. I note that none of this money is for new services. This is purely a compensation package, partial compensation for the effect that the FBT concession proposal has on public hospitals. In no way can it be seen as adding to the provision of public health services in the country. It will go a long way towards alleviating the impact that otherwise would have occurred in reducing their capacity to provide services. I do think it is incumbent upon the government to provide some detail today as to how that is to work or at least some indication of what arrangements are in place to negotiate with the states about implementation. I look forward to the Assistant Treasurer's contribution on that. </para><para>Senator Woodley has mentioned that, as part of the arrangements between the government and the Democrats, there are two inquiries to be held. The first is dealing with the question of indigenous health organisations and the impact on them. I am very pleased that that issue has been identified. I have had a lot of representations from indigenous health organisations. I have recently visited the Kimberley since the announcement and again those organisations spoke to me about the particular problems they have in that regard. So I look forward to that being a positive inquiry. I also hope that we get some progress on that front well before 1 April next year when implementation commences, otherwise it will mean nothing. I am sure Senator Woodley's experience in making such arrangements will ensure that these arrangements are watertight in terms of the impact of the inquiry.</para><para>The second proposed inquiry will be into the definition of charities. I just make the point that we wanted a much broader inquiry and we wanted to look at the impact of the FBT on the charitable sector as part of that inquiry. That clearly now will not happen. In effect, what we are doing now is offering our solution to that problem in this legislation. Nevertheless, the definitions of charities and not-for-profit organisations and the taxation treatment of those are important issues. This government has gradually drawn the charitable and not-for-profit sector into the taxation net. I think that has had a range of adverse consequences for them. We need to examine how we treat charitable and not-for-profit organisations in terms of taxation and other arrangements. </para><para>It is a debate we need to have, particularly with the expansion of schemes like Job Network and the increasing role of not-for-profit organisations in providing what were formerly government and company provided services. There is a real question about what the appropriate roles of charitable and not-for-profit services in this country are, how they are funded and how they are taxed. Those issues go quite a way beyond what is proposed by the inquiry into the definition of charities and not-for-profit organisations. Nevertheless, I hope that makes a contribution to that debate and is a first step in that debate. </para><para>I know there is some anxiety on the part of some in the charitable and not-for-profit sector about opening up those issues, but they do need to be opened up. We have seen quite a change in the way the charitable and not-for-profit sector operate in this country, the services they provide and how they fund themselves. We need to have a public policy debate on what their appropriate role is, what their relationship to government is, and how we fund and tax those organisations. I for one constantly question some of the charitable and not-for-profit organisations about what they do differently from the for-profit sector in some of the service areas, because it is often claimed that they provide a qualitative difference. It is important that we examine what those differences are, how we value them and therefore how we structure regimes that encourage or promote their participation in servicing the needs of our community.  </para><para>I am not opposed to that inquiry although I am a bit concerned that the detail is yet to come and, a few weeks on, we still have not had an announcement. I hope it is not something that drops off the agenda as the government basically gets its legislation through today. Maybe its commitment to, or enthusiasm for, the inquiry might wane if it is not held up to the mark, but I am sure Senator Woodley will keep the pressure on and make sure that the inquiry occurs. As I say, I would have preferred a broader scope but, as far as it goes, it is important that the inquiry does occur. I hope that adds to the debate.</para><para>I do not intend to oppose any of the amendments or the arrangements entered into between the government and the Democrats for changes to the <inline ref="R1008">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000</inline>. We accept the arrangement entered into, we accept it is a better package than was originally proposed, so we will not be opposing any of the measures. I do agree with the Treasurer in the sense that it is time for this matter to be brought to a head and it is time to allow the sector to have some certainty about where we go from here. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>14273</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFrom the Democrats' perspective, three senators with specific responsibilities have been involved in this debate on the <inline ref="R1008">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000</inline>: the first is Senator Woodley, who has a broad remit for the churches and charitable sector; the next is Senator Lees as leader and health spokesperson; and I am the third, and I have responsibility for tax policy in the broadest sense. But this issue captured the attention of the entire Democrat party room. That happened because the churches, charities, not-for-profit and community sector is so broad and has such a wide range of organisations; huge numbers of employees, hundreds of thousands; and billions of dollars in assetsâmost of which are undervaluedâthat, very frequently, we forget just how large that sector is in Australian social and economic life. I suspect that the Labor Party had the same broad interest in it as a result. The very breadth and depth of that sector is now attracting increased policy attention because of its size and nature.</para></talk.start><para>I want to deal with the inquiries issue first. We have been lobbying the governmentâat times, barracking the governmentâfor two inquiries: one into definitions and one into the sector as a whole. At the time we first discussed and raised that idea with senior representatives of the sectorâchurches, charities and not-for-profit organisationsâthey reacted very favourably. They subsequently advised the Labor Party of our views and the sector's views, and the Labor Party came on board. The Labor Party's interest in this matter, as expressed very effectively by Senator Evans, has been very helpful because the need for such an inquiry is a very important one in terms of broad public policy needs.</para><para>The government have now come on board with the first stage of the inquiry, not yet with the detail, but they have not come on board with the second stage. Let me tell you what I mean by that. The first stage, as we heard earlier today, refers to the need to review the definitions. The definitions in tax law affect who falls inside and outside various tax concessions and exemptions. Therefore, it is a matter of acute self-interest by those affected to have those matters properly assessed and properly understood. The public benevolent institutions, charities, churches and so on very much rely on English historical law and case law which is several centuries old. Those definitions no longer fit modern society and the scope of non-government organisationsâNGOsâsuch as community organisations, charitable organisations and church organisations.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âToo narrow or too broad? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âThat is why we want it to be reviewed by an independent body.

There are those who fall outside right now who want to get inside for obvious reasonsâthat is, because tax concessions and benefits will be to their advantageâand there are those who are inside who are afraid that a definitional inquiry would end up with them being put outside. The fact is that some deserve to be in and some certainly deserve to be out, but we want the principles which allow a large number of organisations and a large number of people to get tax concessions and incentives to be clearly established, because it is a cost to the taxpayer and it is a cost to the economy. It is not just a benefit in terms of the services they provide.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats, the senior representatives of those sectors, the Labor Party and now the government all accept that that definitional inquiry should be adopted. However, there is a broader need. Only recentlyâin fact, I think it was last yearâthe government, as a result of negotiations with us over the tax reform program, commissioned a Charities Consultative Committee in the tax office. That committee has opened up a great deal more understanding in the tax office as to the specific needs, the specific problems and the specific prospects for a separate view that should be taken for not-for-profits, church, charitable and community organisations as a whole.</para><para>Members of this chamber knowâbut it is probably not necessarily widely understood in the communityâthat the tax office run certain lines, certain organisational structures, whereby they examine the taxpayers within those sectors. For example, there is small business and large business, those sorts of sectors. Our instinct is that it will be necessary in due course to establish such a line or such a specialisation for the not-for-profit sector. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to have a Ralph type review for that sector which would encompass the whole range of interaction with the tax systemâhow they interact with the indirect tax system, the income tax system, FBT and PAYE; the whole basis of the evaluation and the throughput of moneys within that sector; and what view should be taken in public policy terms of how they should be managed.</para><para>We have argued very strongly with the Treasurer to pursue that second broader in-quiry. Senator Evans indicated that he, too, on behalf of the Labor Party, has that view. The government have not yet committed themselves to that view. However, the Treasurer has not expressed opposition; he has merely said that he needs more time to think it through. Watching his sometimes weary face, I think he probably has enough on his plate right now without that longer term prospect. I am deliberately putting these points to you, Assistant Treasurer, because I think it should be a longer term objective of the government; it is not something that needs to be resolved tomorrow. It could take a year or more, as did the Ralph review, but it is certainly something that needs to be addressed. The definitional inquiry, however, does need to be resolved and dealt with urgently. That is enough from me on the inquiries side.</para><para>I will move on to the tax policy that we are faced with here. Some of this FBT discussion makes people's eyes glaze over, but it really is about the fact that members of the church, charitable and not-for-profit sector have for some time been accorded tax concessions and benefits which are not available to the private sector and the community as a whole. If you decide in those circumstances to discriminate in favour of a sector, it needs to be for good and sound public policy reasons. Those good and sound public policy reasons have, frankly, been the recognition that tax benefits such as an FBT concession will allow those organisations to deliver far better services at a lower cost than they otherwise could. But we should clearly understand that it does result in an inequality between ordinary private sector workers and workers in this sector. Over some time, in the discussion on policy and in the development of a view on this, I pulled out an indicative view as to what this means in terms of the tax rate which somebody in the private sector might have to carry and the tax rate which somebody in the charitable sector might have to carry when their gross salary is the same.</para><para>However, before doing so, I should emphasise that the FBT cap deals with those elements of salary packaging which have to be taken into account; there are many exempt items which fall outside of that. In salary packaging, you might, for instance, want to give somebody the advantage of using a computer. That would be worth $2,000 a year. In my money, I always talk about that being after tax; you would have to earn $4,000 to deliver that. You might have a mobile telephone, which would be worth $2,000 a year; newspapers, which would be worth $500 a year; professional journals, $500 a year; office support systems, $500 a year; frequent flier possibilities of $200 a year; an electronic diary of $300 a year. You can bang that very quickly up to $6,000. I think, by and large, our FBT system is quite generous. </para><para>At the outset, when the Democrats heard the government's public policy intention, we said, `That's right, there shouldn't be an open-ended FBT exemption; any tax concession should be appropriately capped or limited.' I think that is the very remark Senator Evans was making on behalf of the Labor Partyâthat, in public policy terms, there need to be boundaries and limits on these things. But I will give you an idea of what I worked out as a broad indication. On a $70,000 salary, the effective tax rate of somebody in the private sector could work out at 26.3 per cent, and in the charitable sector it could work out at 16.7 per centâin other words, a 10 per cent advantage. We say, for good public policy reasons, that kind of advantage can be justified. But we should recognise that it does mean that a private sector person does not enjoy the same tax concessions, the same tax benefits, as somebody working in the charitable sector.</para><para>I think the cap of $17,000 for the hospitals sector and the $30,000 cap for the charitable sector end up as being generous. That is my personal opinion. I think the addition of the extra elements negotiated by the Democrats with the government, such as the remote housing concession, do contribute materially to making sure that needs are looked after where they need to be applied.</para><para>Having said that, we must therefore recognise that, for an ordinary worker in charities, churches or hospitals, at an ordinary worker's salary, a cap of $17,000 grossed up value or $30,000 grossed up value is a great deal of money. For people on much higher salaries it will result in a tightening up of the tax system. With the exception of those who are needed particularly in rural and remote areas of Australia, who need to be of a very high standard and, therefore, to be well paid, by and large, our belief is that the package we have negotiated with the government will deliver the appropriate policy outcomes whilst still taking into account the very real need for a high standard of service from those organisations. As a result, most of the sector has been fully supportive of what has been negotiated by the government. In closing, I would like to indicate that Democrats sheet 1777 is being withdrawn and therefore should be disregarded on the running sheet.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>14275</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âQuite a wide range of issues has been raised. I listened very carefully to what was said by Senator Woodley, Senator Murray, Senator Evans and Senator Lees. Very briefly, in relation to one of the matters raised by Senator Lees and noted by Senator Evans, to assist with the transition of the new FBT arrangements, the government will provide grants to public and not-for-profit hospitals of $88 million in 2000-01, some $80.5 million in 2001-02 and $72 million in 2002-03.</para></talk.start><para>There were some issues raised as to how these grants would be allocated. Let me just state clearly that it is the intention of the government that these grants will get through to those hospitals which are affected by the cap. While the implementation details are still to be worked through, transitional assistance will be pro rataed on the basis of the financial impact of the FBT arrangements on public and not-for-profit hospitals. I think the intention of us all is at one here, if I have read the debate correctly.

We may have had our differences on this bill but, of course, at the end of the day we have to settle arrangements. That is what has been done. I do not propose to go over those debates. But the issue of the nature of the inquiry was raised. I think that probably the best thing I can do is just to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the comments from the Treasurer's press release on this.

I can only say that that is absolutely correct. Nonetheless, the Treasurer has great capacity for work, and I am sure that he will turn his mind to some of those other issues as soon as he is able.

This is a debate which I have entered into briefly, left and come back to, but my understanding is that the primary concern of the Democrats was that the original proposals meant that the hospitals who had appropriated the savings, by your argument, would lose them.

As you know, that has been one of the issues of concern in terms of the FBT treatment of police officer remote housing, particularly in states like my own of Western Australia where officers are required to live in police premises in remote communities and are obviously on call 24 hours a dayâit is pretty much a round the clock job. There has been a great deal of concern about their treatment.</para></talk.start><para>I think I understand the outcome of the arrangements in terms of that, but it has been an issue of concern for a number of people.

So I would appreciate your putting on the record the government's understanding of the FBT treatment of police officer remote housing accommodation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>14277</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Senator, for your remarks. I have had that discussion with the relevant police associations that have been very active around Parliament House, and I would not be breaching any confidence if I suggested that I was one of a great number of senators who were visited. I gave them a proposal, which they said they accepted but wanted to look very closely at the detail. The bill gives an exemption if a housing benefit is provided by police services in a place at least 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 or more people. This, we believe, enhances the delivery of police services to communities in regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>It is actually a provision which applies on the same basis as the exemption for FBT housing that this bill provides for public and not-for-profit hospitals and charities. So it is the same test for the police which applies to those other bodies. We have listened to the concerns which they have raised. They raised with us a number of other issues, but I think this is the fairest way to deal with them. One could always argue that you should go furtherâand I am sure that the relevant associations may well argue thatâbut this was the proposal that the government decided to move forward on and discussed with the relevant police associations. I think it is a good outcome. I think it should be welcomed by the police. It deals with a problem which we all became aware of. I welcome the support which my colleague Senator Evans has given.</para><para>With the permission of the chamber, I propose to move all the remaining government requestsâthat is, requests (3), (6) and (9) on sheet DT215, requests (1) to (9) on sheet DG216 and request (1) on sheet DT212. My understanding is that this covers all the requests that the government is moving. Perhaps we can now ensure that these are passed through the Senate and that the certainty which we all hope to deliver to the relevant associations can now be delivered.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>âIs leave granted for those requests to be moved together?</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(3)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 8 to 14), omit step 3, substitute:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Step 3 </inline>If step 2 does not apply in respect of one or more employees of the employer:</para><para>(a)	reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 to zero; and</para><para>(b)	reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for a later year of tax by $30,000, but not below zero.</para><para>(6)	Schedule 1, item 16, page 16 (lines 9 to 27), omit steps 2, 3, 4 and 5, substitute:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Step 2.</inline> Reduce the individual grossed-up non-rebatable amount for each employee of the employer:</para><para>(a)	to zero for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000; and</para><para>(b)	by $30,000, but not below zero, for a later year of tax.</para><para>Note: Paragraph (a) means the employer's aggregate non-rebatable amount for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 will be nil.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Step 3. </inline>Add up the results of step 2 for all the employer's employees.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Step 4. </inline>Multiply the sum from step 3 by the FBT rate.

My office and probably other senators' offices, and perhaps your office, have been receiving inquiries from people affected by the legislation as to exactly how the new system will work. Minister, is there any form of information campaign or release of material, particularly to the state bureaucracies, to ensure that the actual message as to how this will work will get out to the affected people in a form which is complete and very clear?

From the government's point of view, it is clearly important that people understand what we have done. It is clearly important to the tax office that people can comply in a way which minimises their work but meets the terms of the law. So I think it is in everybody's interests that people are properly informed. Clearly the ATO will monitor this carefully to ensure that the information is getting out. If it becomes apparent that people are still not sure, we would obviously look at further steps which could be taken. You raise a valid point. I think there will be a lot of requests for the EM and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> in which we have debated this legislation. I think we can all help to ensure that people are appropriately informed. I think this is an outcome which people will generally welcome. You and Senator Evans and I knew that concerns were being expressed about the original proposal. I think we are all aware of those. We may differ on how we all react to that, but, as I said earlier in this debate, in the end you have to reach a compromise and I think this has been reached.

Senator Calvert, who is present in the chamber, actually gave me the whips' Blue Hills award at the end of last year for speaking so frequently on this issue, but it is certainly a story that needs to be told because there are quite a lot of misconceptions out there in regional Australia about what is happening in the Hunter Valley and, in particular, what has happened since the downsizing of BHP. For example, people think there is no steel industry in Newcastle anymore, and I want to correct that impression.</para></talk.start><para>The main thing I want to talk about is the economic miracle that is occurring in the Hunter Valley. Since the downsizing of BHP, there has been considerable growth in employment. Each month since BHP shut its steel making division, employment in the Hunter Valley has continued to rise and unemployment has continued to fall. One of the reasons for that is that the whole nature of the Hunter Valley economy is changing quite dramatically. Newcastle has had the image of a smokestack town for a very long period of time, and that is actually embedded in the national psyche to the point that some people cannot think of it as anything else. As a matter of fact, my mother-in-law, who has been coming to Newcastle for many yearsâshe used to spend her holidays in Mayfield in the 1930sâstill has this image of a smokestack town because that is how it was and that is what is embedded in her mind. A lot of people who have travelled over the years through Newcastle have the same view, but there is a huge change.</para><para>As I drive into Newcastle to my office each day, I pass BHP. The first thing I notice is the clear skies over Newcastle because steel smelting, which is the filthy end of the steel making business, has gone. We still bring steel billets up from South Australia and we continue to roll steel. BHP has had a long history in Newcastle; it has had a great history. It also has, through its spin-off steel divisions, a great future. Often people do not understand the amount of steel that is still produced, rolled and goes out the gate in Newcastle. For example, a lot of people are unaware that Smorgon, the old Comsteel, has an arc furnace in Newcastle. It still produces 400,000 tonnes of steel a year from raw material, and at the BHP site 1Â½ million tonnes of steel is still rolled from those billets that come up from South Australia into rod, bar, wire and tube, and they still go out the gate, serving all the downstream steel industries in the region. </para><para>Over at BHP, and at its new associated company that it is spinning off, they are still employing 1,800 people in the production of steel. I want to make that point very clear because it is still a city that produces steel. What is happening is an expansion of a vast array of other industries. Even at the point where BHP were about to shut down, they were only employing one per cent of the Hunter Valley economy. BHP were employing 2,600 people, and the work force in the Hunter Valley is now up to 246,000. So let us get that in the scale which it deserves: BHP, in their final days in Newcastle, were only a very small part of the economy. They are still a part of the economy and are still producing steel, but they are only a part of a very diverse and wide-ranging economy, and those things are continuing.</para><para>Let us have a look at the big employers in the Hunter Valley at the moment. First prize goes to the Hunter area health serviceâit is the biggest employer; the second biggest employer is the University of Newcastle; and a huge industry in that area is the aerospace industry based at Williamtown. It not only employs thousands of people to support the biggest fighter base in Australiaâwith the FA18s located thereâbut also employs a range of spin-off surrounding industries that support the aerospace industry. For example, we are creating up there the lead-in fightersâthey are actually being built at Williamtown. There are plans to attract a whole range of other aerospace industries. Of course, beyond that, there are magnificent tourist facilities in the Hunter Valley, which are creating a larger and larger throughput of people who come to that beautiful region for their holidays. We have the Barrington Tops, the Blue Water Wonderland at Port Stephens, Lake Macquarie, Historic Newcastle, Historic Maitland and the surrounding areas. That industry is absolutely booming.</para><para>There is a lot of confidence in the town. That confidence was not shaken a great deal even when BHP shut. When BHP announced its downsizing, that created a drop in confidence for a few months, but that confidence came back incredibly quickly. The event that brought that back was Newcastle's great win in 1997 in the football when the Knights took out the premiership for the first time. This had an amazing effect on the whole city. People there support the Knights and they really showed that on the day of the premiership when the team was leaving: tens of thousands of fans lined the streets and roads leading out of Newcastle to cheer them on. When the team came back, of course, there were even more people there. There was a civic parade. There was enormous pride in the city at that time. We had been tracking consumer and business confidence when BHP announced its downsizing, and for three months it fell and kept dropping until we won that football game. The interesting thing that happened economically was that, as soon as we won the game, confidence jumped right back to where it had been before BHP announced its downsizing, and it has stayed above that level and continued to climb ever since.</para><para>We now have a place with enormous confidence. It has record high employment. We have a drop in unemployment month by month. The figures for the March quarter show that there is a 13.1 per cent increase in the work force over the previous period last year. There are 262,000 people working in the Hunter Valley in a wide variety of industries. Job growth is very strong. The new jobs are concentrated not in the manufacturing area but in the service sector. There has been a growth in both full-time and part-time jobs. There are rising rates of female employment, and people who were not previously looking for work are now entering the work force.</para><para>Newcastle and the Hunter are on the cutting edge of what is happening to change employment in this country. It is an excellent case study of how we are moving from the smokestack age to the information and service age, and the Newcastle and Hunter economy is at the forefront and is reflecting that. The federal government has given a lot of assistance in the transition process that is taking place at this time. The Prime Minister came to Newcastle in 1997 and it showed the maturity of the city that, during his time there, there was not one protest, not one banner. He was welcomed to the city with a major civic reception. He stayed for two days, listened to what the region wanted and then provided for it through the Hunter Structural Adjustment Package. He also set up a Prime Minister's task force to specifically advise him on the needs of the Hunter. Over the 2Â½ years since that visit, we have been rolling out quite a number of projects which are aiming to build up the infrastructure of the Hunter Valley.  </para><para>Unlike the state Labor government, what we are doing federally is actually creating, through the public sector, basic infrastructure which private businesses can then leverage off and create new businesses and new jobs. That is happening quite dramatically. We have set up projects like the Maitland Transport Hub. We put $1Â½ million into that transport hub, and what we have seen happen since then is that companies like Daimler Chrysler, the old Mercedes-Benz, have set up their trucking operation in the area and that Blue Ribbon Coaches have set up their centralised operations there. We are seeing around that research park, since we delivered that money two years ago, a whole lot of related industries attracted there.</para><para>We also funded the Hunter water pipeline. With half a million dollars of investment from the federal government, they were able to get a loan of $10 million. Within six months they had actually constructed that pipeline that links in to every vineyard in the Hunter Valley. What this will now do for the Hunter, which produces some of the best wines in Australia, is to give it a secure water supply into every vineyard. That will increase grape yield and increase production by an expansion of the vineyards. This will then kick on to an expansion in the wineries, the restaurants, the resorts and other economic activityâincluding, increasingly, residential activity in the beautiful Pokolbin area near Cessnock. That sort of growth, with just a small amount of public money, leverages an enormous amount of economic activity.</para><para>We have done that through the whole program. We had Joe Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, come up two weeks ago to relaunch the Newcastle Stock Exchange. This was created in the 1930s and shut in the early 1980s. What we have now done, with the new type of information economy that we have developing in Australia, is to reopen a regional stock exchange which will actually aggregate very small amounts of money into investment pools which will then be spent in regional Australia. This is a landmark stock exchange. It is much cheaper to list there than it is through Sydney, and we think this will attract regional funds from right around Australia and will create regional investment right around Australia as a result.</para><para>Small businesses have been part of this operation as well. It is not just big business. Small businesses are the hope of the future and, through these projects, we have stimulated quite a lot of small business. Another amount of funding we gave was $500,000 to the business incubator in Lake Macquarie. As people come in, they operate a very small business in its early stages and they get the support of having an office, fax, phone and such facilities. They get mentoring advice from experienced business people for the first year. The research shows that, instead of 70 per cent of new businesses failing, when you have business incubators supporting them 70 per cent of them succeed. The research also shows that those people who do start in those businesses each go on to employ six other people.</para><para>We have an enormous amount of economic activity developing in the Hunter Valley, and that is growing and expanding, particularly through new big businesses which are actually expanding within the Hunter region and particularly in the services area. One of the best examples of that is Impulse Airlines, run by local businessman Jerry McGowan, who has now moved through to creating a national network of airlines in competition with Qantas and Ansett. You all remember the case of Compass, which tried to take on Qantas and Ansett and failed. Impulse is trying the same thing but in a very different way. It is an existing airline that is expanding, and that is one very good reason why it will succeed. The second reason is that we are in a very different regulatory climate under this government. We have a situation now where, through the ACCC, we are very confident that they will have a much better show of developing. Ansett and Qantas are responding by dropping fares. They are increasing their services, and jets are coming into the area. This is great for regional Australia. </para><para>What I have outlined today is quite a lot of developing economic activities. We have moved from the smokestack age through to an information service economy. The federal government has put enormous resources into supporting this. I urge this parliament, given the great kick-off we have had over the last three years, that this continue. With strategic, targeted, public investment we can leverage an enormous amount of private investment, particularly in regional and rural Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition 2000</title><page.no>14283</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>14283</page.no><name role="metadata">Senator GREIG,</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this afternoon to speak on the topic of the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition held earlier this year.

It was a very prestigious line-up indeed.</para><para>Over 60 lawyers are required to judge the 12 teams normally participating in the preliminary rounds. The Australian team that went to Washington comprised a contingent from Sydney and Melbourne universities. In Washington, during the first round of heats, the Melbourne team beat teams from Germany, Costa Rica, Canada, the Dominican Republic and then Sydney, while in the quarterfinals the Melbourne team beat Greece and in the semifinals Mexico fell to Melbourne's superior talents. The finals, which were hotly contested, saw Melbourne beat the team from Venezuela to become world champions for this new millennium. Two of the judges involved in the final rounds were the recently retired Judge Stephen Schwebel of the International Court of Justice and Gavin Griffiths, Australia's former Solicitor-General.</para><para>This competition is far more than a debating session held over a few weeks. Students spend more than 12 months in preparation in both researching their topic and raising the necessary funds to participate in this international competition. The Melbourne team was coached by Ian Malkin and Sundhya Pahuja from the law school at their university. The work is arduous. Participants research, draft and then orally defend memorials, responding to issues posed in a hypothetical problem of international law. The topic debated in this year's competition was about vaccine trials. Given the current nature of the debate in this country on genetically modified foods and biotechnology generally, it was perhaps timely and very appropriate as a topic of choice.</para><para>Australian students have been the most successful in the records of the competition. This year we again hit the top spot. Australian teams have been winners in the international final three times and runners-up on numerous other occasions. Much of this is due to the support which the Australian rounds of the competition receive from the judiciary, legal practitioners and government officials, many of whom are ex-Jessup mooters. </para><para>It is perhaps ironic that at a time when the Australian government is seeking to wind back Australia's participation in international law fora, particularly in the area of human rights, as a country we are producing state-of-the-art excellence in international law. How sad it would be if the rich talent which has been readily exhibited by this enthusiastic team from Melbourne University were contrasted by the lack of political will here in our own country. As I have stated before, respect for international law requires all the international norms and statutesânot only the economic and military ones but the human rights aspect of this area of jurisprudence also.</para><para>Congratulations must also go to the team from Sydney University for their hard work and dedication which saw them rise to the finals of this terrific competition. These competitions have proven to be a great training ground for some of Australia's most outstanding legal minds. All teams from around Australia who participated in the domestic heats are to be commended for their performances. I trust these young lawyers will go on to have promising careers in the judiciary, legal profession, corporations, universities, perhaps parliaments, and diplomatic and international organisations. I am sure they will uphold Australia's strong tradition of legal excellence in their future careers. On behalf of my Australian Democrats colleagues, I sincerely congratulate the team and their coaches from the Melbourne University.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</title><page.no>14284</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>14284</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to recognise a group of people who are severely disadvantaged in our modern societyâthe sufferers of a condition called chronic fatigue syndrome, often referred to as ME as well. These people suffer from vast variations of symptoms in relation to this disease or medical condition. For too long I believe the Australian government has failed to sufficiently recognise the importance of CFS/ME.</para></talk.start><para>There are certain things that lead to the expansion of chronic fatigue syndrome in our modern society. First of all, I would like to briefly look at what is chronic fatigue syndrome. It is a debilitating illness characterised by general malaise, extreme fatigue after physical or mental exertion, muscle aches and pains; severe headaches, and problems with concentration and memory. I believe it goes further than that as wellâalso chemical sensitivity can bring on such conditions as a reaction to sunlight and obviously an adverse reaction to the use of chemicals. How is chronic fatigue syndrome presently diagnosed? There is actually no single specific test to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome. The diagnosis is made by looking at the patient's history and the debilitating effects it has on their daily lives.</para><para>Some of the issues that contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome stem possibly from the continual increase in pesticides and antibiotics that are used in the preparation of food today. At the present moment ANZFA is looking at and assessing a further 16 chemicals. It is also looking at proposals to extend the use of up to 30 pesticides. The National Toxic Network and the Total Environment Centre are both heavily involved in campaigning on pesticide issues, as are many other local groups.</para><para>I would like to both recognise and put on record the work that is done by the ACT group on chronic fatigue syndrome. They primarily have been the motivation behind today's jigsaw puzzle that we have at the present moment outside the front of Parliament House. This very clearly depicts that chronic fatigue syndrome is far more than one or two elements; it is quite substantial. There are so many different segments of the condition that I could not relate them all here today. Suffice it to say, it goes much further than a person's inability to carry on their normal life because of fatigue. That is a substantial part of it, but the chemical sensitivity is also a compounding factor in this condition that these people find themselves suffering from.</para><para>Pesticide and antibiotic residue levels, MRLs, are assessed and set ultimately by ANZFA after consultation with different groups of people. I believe that we need to look at other aspects that are contributing to this debilitating condition; that is, the amount of chemicals in the building materials that we use, both in our commercial buildings and in our residential homes, and the effects of those chemicals in the atmosphere within the areas in which we work and reside in our homes. We also need to look very closely at the chemical content or residue that is in the food that we consume, because we are, to a large degree, what we eat. We have proposals worldwide at present to use genetically modified `organisms', as they call themâI prefer to call it food, because they are genetically modifying the food that we are consuming. I believe that one of the areas that will, in the future, impact severely on sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome is the ability to genetically modify plants so that they will be able to be sprayed with ever increasing chemicals and at ever increasing dosage rates. </para><para>We only need to look at soya as an example. Soya has been genetically altered to be able to withstand Round Up without any detriment to the soy bean itself or to the growth of the plant. However, in the assessment of that soy, I believe that the scientific analysis that was carried out on the soy beans was carried out on soy that had been grown in laboratory conditions and had not even been exposed to Round Up whereas, in reality, when the soy is grown in broad crops it is sprayed with Round Up. I do not believe that the scientific analysis of that has been sufficient to have an understanding of the chemical residue in the soy bean itself.</para><para>We also need to look at the use of antibiotics in the food that we use. There has been some recent evaluation of antibiotics used in food, and it was decided that the veterinary use of antibiotics is not contributing to antibiotic resistance. I believe that the use of antibiotics is now going much further than veterinary use and is being used in an inappropriate way in the production of food that we ultimately consume in our diets. If we look at genetically modified cotton and its ability to be sprayed with chemicals, the cotton product itself is not of concern, but the cotton seed that is actually introduced into the food chain by way of feedlot through our meat is of concern.</para><para>Where do I believe that we need to move? We need to move in the direction of the government officially recognising chronic fatigue syndrome as a medical condition. We then need to look at the building criteria that we use in the construction of our buildings and, where possible, substantially reduce chemicals that are used in the production of those building materials. The third issueâand I believe this is one of the more important issuesâis that we need to look at the food chain that we are consuming. I believe that we need a reduction in the permissible levels of chemical residues in our food, not going the other way to actually allow greater residual levels.</para><para>But coming back to the chronic fatigue sufferers themselves, what can we do as a society in recognition of their condition? We need a greater understanding within the medical fraternity for doctors to be able to identify at much earlier stages the symptoms of chronic fatigue. We need to be more flexible for these people in their daily lives, particularly in the needs that are placed upon them in the workplace. We need to test periodically the physical limits imposed on the sufferers, both by the illness and the stresses of modern-day life. The people who have chronic fatigue syndrome definitely need a very understanding and supportive family unit; they need friends; and they need assistance from the communities. In some cases where the condition is extremely debilitating, we need to put in place home care; they need special sickness benefits; and they also need counselling.</para><para>Can the chronic fatigue syndrome be overcome? Yes, it can, but it is a very long road. It is interesting that when, along with my fellow senators and the members from the House of Representatives, we were speaking to the group earlier on, I apologised for the fact that I had the flu and was having a little difficulty in speaking. One gentleman very poignantly pointed out, `Well, I'll swap with you any day.' What he was referring to was the fact that within two or three days I will be over my flu and feel well again whereas, in his condition, he is facing this in all probability for the rest of his life. Yes, CFS can be cured if the community that we live in places sufficient understanding and sufficient resources into scientific analysis of the condition and we look towards improving our use of chemicals in our way of life. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.19 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CENTENARY OF FEDERATION: JOINT SITTING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>14286</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14286</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOrder!

We are very much concerned to promote stronger families and stronger communities, so there is $240 million over four years to establish a partnership between government, families and communities. There is $65.4 million there for child-care choice. Families are particularly interested in jobs for their children and themselves, so $2 billion over four years for the new apprenticeships program is similarly very good news. The growth in jobs has now exceeded 650,000 new jobs through the strong economic growth we have achieved by taking the tough decisions.</para></talk.start><para>But I think what families are particularly impressed by is the discipline that this government has shown when that is contrasted with the ill-discipline of its predecessor. In other words, this fifth budget of ours is the fifth in a row that is in surplus. We have not borrowed one centâyou have to go back to about 1910 to even get a comparable performance. In the last five budget years of our predecessors they managed to rack up $80 billion in debt, and in our five years we have reduced that by $50 billion. That is a monumental achievement because it enables us to deliver not only $9 billion off debt; it then translates into interest rates which still see Australians paying $225 less per month for the average home mortgage than they were paying when the coalition was elected in 1996. So there is a great deal to be excited about for ordinary families. But I think the most significant news of all that comes out of this budget is the Labor Party's response to it. If we look at what Mr Crean had to say, with a touch of the Melhams, on 3LO this morning about the Timor tax, he was absolutely livid that this source of revenue had been taken away from themâlike a boy missing his candy:</para><quote><para>Do you support the decision to remove it?</para><para>What we support is our troops in Timor.</para><para>Well, can you say it's a good idea not to have it now?</para><para>Now, now, just understand we accepted it because our troops had to be supported in Timor.</para><para>But do you support removing it?</para><para>And the government said it didn't have the funds to do it. We're not going to stand in the way for full support for our troops.</para></quote><para>They ran this for a couple of hours this morning and then they dropped it like a log because they know it is a classic example of Labor's propensity to spendâhigh tax, high debt, not interested in reducing the debt. They are livid that we have gone down that path. They actually very much resent the fact that we have delivered $12 billion in tax cuts.</para><para>Did anyone hear Mr Beazley on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning? He basically said, `Look, it is terribly unfortunate they have wasted this money on debt retirement. They could have spent it on the knowledge economy.' The knowledge economy is actually a two-word policy. It is Labor's mantra that they trot out every time. It is obviously research driven sloganising. But, really, about the only people that are in need of any help from the knowledge economy would be people like Senator Conroy, who does not even know the difference between cash and accrual accounting, as was rather pathetically demonstrated in the estimates committee recently.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âYou tell us about it, Dick.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âI know you have to defend the altar boy.

In other words, what Labor is saying is they do not support the compensation package. They would reduce the tax cuts. They would do anything to spend more money. They wanted that Timor tax kept in place. That is very bad news for Australian families.

We are delivering the largest tax cuts in Australian history. The Labor Party refuses to guarantee these tax cuts. The Labor Party says that it believes that there should be a higher deficit. The Labor Party has pointed to areas where it thinks there should be increased spending. The question is: how is the Labor Party going to raise the money?

The coalition makes no apology for creating jobs and reducing unemployment to its lowest levels in a decade. There is a very big issue now before the Australian people. The issue is that the Labor Party cannot be allowed to get away with its disgraceful performance on fiscal and budgetary policy. The Labor Party has refused to guarantee the income tax collections that we are delivering, and here Senator Cook gets up and in his question attempts to demean these largest income tax cuts in Australian history.

First of all, it delivers on the tax cuts for all Australians, the tax cuts which will be particularly welcomed by rural and regional Australians. It provides for the first time ever the wherewithal to give rural and regional Australians access to the same sorts of health services that city Australians take for granted. As well as that, it will provide Australians living in remote and rural Australia with access to quality education, something that was denied them by the Labor government during its 13 years in office. It will also continue the good work started by the Howard government in the provision of transaction and financial services to rural and regional Australia. The budget is fair for those reasons. It is responsible because it will remove huge costs from the exports that emanate from rural and regional Australia and because it will remove from all rural and regional Australians the very high burden of transport costs. We will be reducing the cost of petrol for transport trucks by 24c a litre and the cost of fuel for business use by between 7c and 10c a litre. So they are tremendous policies.</para></talk.start><para>The shadow ministerâI might say the city-centric shadow ministerâfor rural services said that this budget was `a sad joke'. That was his description of it. Unfortunately he has rarely been in rural and regional Australia, and his view is not shared by others, particularly people in rural and regional Australia. For example, the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> stated that this budget `is the biggest boost for health for people living in rural and remote Australia since the advent of the flying doctor'. The National Farmers Federation congratulated the government on targeting rural health as its top priority and it also welcomed the commitment we made to the discount factor for farm business being increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. The Isolated Children's Parents Association also congratulated the government on doing what they have been calling for. Madam President, the list goes on.</para><para>I am asked by Senator Eggleston as well whether I am aware of alternative policies. I am; I am aware that the Labor Party have a proposal to maintain fuel excise. So instead of giving away that 24c a litre cost, the Labor Party's policy is to maintain it. The Labor Party increased fuel excise from 9c to 44c a litre in their time, and they want to maintain those increases. As I understand their policy, they also want to maintain the wholesale sales tax and maintain the GST in a rolled back form. Further, they want to keep the RTC program, the Rural Transaction Centres program, which is an initiative of the Howard government. The Labor Party have form when it comes to policies for rural and regional Australia. Their policies made rural and regional Australians pay 17 to 20 per cent on overdrafts. They made rural Australians pay the interest on $80 billion of debt that rural Australians got no benefit from, but rural Australians had to pay the interest on that $80 billion debt that the Labor Party ran up. The Labor Party policy, as demonstrated during their 13 years in office, was to close 277 postal outlets.

Even Senator O'Brien would agree with that statement. There is no question about it. It is a question of fact. In addition to that, we have differentially funded the private hospital system to get over the problem that we inherited, where many people had dropped out of private health insurance and an extraordinary burden was put on the public hospital system as a result of the fallout of the private hospital system. We have brought in major initiatives to redress the imbalance that occurred. Medicare and the public hospital system can only survive providing there is a balance between the public hospital system and the private hospital system, which we had before the Labor Party came to power 13 years ago.</para></talk.start><para>We have influenced this by putting an enormous sum of money into subsidising private health insurance to take the pressure off the public hospital system.

The government have been very successful in delivering increased jobs, and we take great pride in that. Equally, the government take great pride in winding back the very high levels of unemployment that were left to us by the previous government. When we survey the wreckage of the Labor years, the wreckage of their high taxes and high borrowing, we can see that perhaps one the worst effects of thisâand, of course, the recession that, according to Labor, we had to haveâwas the large number of Australians who found themselves without a job. This government takes great pride, Senator Stott Despoja, in winding back the levels of unemployment. We regard that as one of the key priorities of this government. That is the reason why we have to have responsible budgets. That is the reason why we have to create a climate which enables the economy to grow. So the point I make to you is that, if you look at the budget forecasts, you will see that the Australian economy will continue to grow strongly in the current year. This perhaps will not be quite at the same levels as the previous year but certainly at very strong levels. I think that we can take great pride that this will help create those real jobs that we believe are so important in this economy.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to get the economic settings right. If you do not get those settings right, you do not deliver the real outcomes that this government wants.

We are seeing, of course, an upsurge in the world economy. What we are seeing is strong export growthâand this is particularly good for those sectors. But we take great pride in delivering the outcomes that we have had. Some of the decisions we have had to take, Senator Stott Despoja, have not been easy decisions. If I reflect on the comments that some of your colleagues made on those early budgets of ours which enabled Australia to survive the Asian crisis and which enabled Australia to bring down the levels of interest rates, Senator, the decisions we made at that time were not easy; they were opposed by many in this chamber. But we have delivered, Senator Stott Despoja, in spades.</para><para>I think the senator should take comfort from the good growth prospects of the Australian economy. Senator Stott Despoja should particularly note the very supportive comments that this budget has received from businessâafter all, many of the new jobs are going to be created in the business community. The senator should also take note of the fact that the unemployment levels have continued to fall in this country, and she should take note that this is a government that, because its settings are responsible, delivers real outcomes, and the one we take particular pride in is the fall in unemployment. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14298</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs a supplementary question, I ask the minister again: how did Treasury arrive at the 6.25 per cent figure in relation to the unemployment rate?

Last night's budget was a false budget. Last night's budget has been universally panned by the critics. In fact, if last night's budget was a play, you would never open it on Broadway, given what the economic pundits have revealed about it. Last night's budget was a budget full of accountancy tricks, tricks aimed at masking the real weakness of the Australian budgetary position and tricks aimed at masking an understanding by the Australian electorate as to what in fact this government has now foisted upon them.</para><para>Last night's budget includes a phoney surplus, includes income tax cuts that disappear in one year, includes a GST that the government pretends is not theirs and includes a complete failure to invest in Australia's future. All of those in the present context are important economic crimes against the Australian people. But the worst, if you had to rank them, is the lastâno preparation for Australia's future. There is little or no investment in the Australian education system. There is no investment in the future of Australian science. There is no investment in national infrastructure, something that is complained about loudly by the National Farmers Federation. There is little attention to regional development in this nation. When the people in the Australian bush are screaming out for greater assistance to help develop their regional economies, they get very little attention from this government. As we have just heard in the last question from Senator Stott Despoja, there is no investment in jobs and there is no investment in making Australian industry more internationally competitive so that we can compete more effectively on the global stage, strengthen our economy and find real high paid, high skilled jobs for Australian workers. That is the most damning part of last night's budget.</para><para>Let me turn to the issue of the phoney surplus, because this is something that economic commentators have paid attention to. Treasurer Peter Costello claims a budget surplus of $2.8 billion. This is achieved entirely by fiddling the budget. There are three key fiddles: reducing record outlays by providing a $1.65 billion GST top-up payment to the states as a loan, not as an outlay; including the asset sale of the mobile phone spectrum in the budget as a contribution to their surplus; and shifting almost $700 million of Reserve Bank dividends from 1999-2000 to 2000-01. So the claimed surplus of $2.84 billion goes: state GST grant fiddle, deduct $1.65 billion; sale of spectrum fiddle, deduct $2.6 billion; Reserve Bank dividend fiddle, deduct $0.68 billion. The real outcome of this budget is not a surplus of $2.84 billion; it is a deficit of $2.1 billion. That is the genuine situation. It is about time the government, which trumpets this issue of budget honesty, owned up and told the Australian people exactly what is the honest position. </para><para>The income tax cuts which disappear in the space of one year are a matter of grave concern for all Australians. We have heard that compensation for the introduction of a regressive and confusing tax, the GST, will be paid for by massive income tax cuts. Well, will they? No-one believes it. In fact, we remember the words of the Prime Minister: `No-one will be worse off as a consequence of the GST.' We now know that is an outright untruth. But the income tax cuts disappear in the space of two years and we end up having to pay more in income tax, $600 on average per year per Australian, after two years. The budget papersâand I gave the references to the Assistant Treasurer in my question todayâshow that to be a fact. There is a graph in the budget paper which sets out the growth in revenues for income tax. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14301</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Senator Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOnce again, the ALP is trying to justify its poor economic credentials by trying to tear down this government's responsible budget and the initiatives of this government and by trying to attack the government's economic performance. In doing so, the ALP is trying to hide what a dismal mess it left. Actions speak louder than words. When you look at the actions of the former Labor government, you see exactly what sort of economic disaster they left us with. After 13 years of government, they are not prepared to admit that they left us with an 11.2 per cent unemployment rate and that they left us with $80 billion worth of debt. </para></talk.start><para>It is very hard for the Australian public to understand what $1 billion means. It is hard for me to comprehend $1 billion. They left us with $80 billion and the interest on that $80 billion of debt was the equivalent of what was being spent on education and one other whole portfolio. So we saw whole portfolio budgets being eaten up by paying interest on the debt. What they did was live off the next generationâlive off future Australians, young Australians. Senator Stott Despoja comes in and says that she represents young people. I did not hear her bleating about the appalling debt that the Labor Party was getting us into. Before the last election, they hid the fact that there was an extra $10 billion worth of debt, a $10 billion black hole in the budget. </para><para>When they were caught out and it was pointed out that we inherited a $10 billion deficit that they had failed to tell us about, along with the other $70 billion of debt, Gareth Evans, who then, thankfully for the Australian public, became the shadow Treasurer, said, `Yes, but that was a deficit that would have and could have been corrected.' Then he went on to say, `You have to have a reliable Treasury and it was the Treasury forecast that let us down.' That was what he said on <inline font-style="italic">Nightline</inline> in May 1998. He said, `It wasn't the product of any big spend-up or any undiscipline by the Labor government; it was just some lousy figuring by Treasury on their inflation and growth projections which had serious implications on the revenue side.' That is the way he explained away $10 billion. </para><para>What else did they do? Somebody on the other side asked a question about the foreign aid program today. The implication was that the Labor Party would spend more money on foreign aid. Let me ask you: where would they get it? Would they get it from increasing taxes? Most probably the answer is yes because they did not want to get rid of the Timor levy. Would they get it by rolling back the GST? Most probably the answer is yes. But ask us what they are going to roll back and we will tell you the complications in that. Or would they get it from borrowing from overseas? Maybe they would because they are very good at borrowing. They borrowed $80 billion in the last five years in governmentâ$10 billion of which they failed to tell us about. They were borrowing $1 billion a year to pay for social security fraud. Senator Newman has rolled back, in terms of social security fraud and overpayments, $1 billion a year. Of that $10 billion that they had borrowed in their last year, $1 billion was borrowed from the future of every young person in Australia, $1 billion was borrowed to pay for social security fraud. That is the record of mismanagement of the Labor government. </para><para>What else did they do? They sold Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and the airports and put that money into recurrent funding. They did not use it to retire debt. The $80 billion debt is now back to $50 billionâwe have retired $30 billion of that debt. We have reduced the interest payment on that. If the Labor Party came back in, we would be looking at them borrowing money, going on a spending spree, putting up taxes and borrowing from Australia's future, instead of having a sensible and balanced policy which would enable economic growth, reduce inflation, reduce interest rates, reduce unemployment and give young people in Australia a future and not borrow from their inheritance.</para><para>The coalition is about delivering sustainable long-term growth and fully funded taxation reform that delivers the tax cuts that we promise, unlike Labor who promised l-a-w law tax cuts and then reneged on them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>14302</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am disappointed that Senator Kemp has been unable to stay to listen to the debate, although I hope he is listening in his office.

I find it a bit odd to accept that the Labor Party can stand up in this august chamber and criticise the government for bringing in a surplus. This is not the smoke and mirrors budget of 1996 when there was going to be a surplus budget, when Senator Cook, who was then representing the Minister for Finance, said that there was going to be a surplus in that budget. What did we find out when we came in? We found not a surplus but a $10.4 billion deficit.

They are irresponsible when it comes to matters fiscal. You cannot do it. I thought, `$10 billion: this reeks of the Khemlani years again!' What were they going to do? Were they going to borrow $10 billion again from the Saudi Arabians, as Mr Khemlani was going to do, to prop up the government in those awful years of the 1970s? Was that what they were going to do? Yet they have got the temerityâand the audacity, I might sayâto stand here and criticise the government for bringing in one of the best budgets that this chamber has seen for 90 years.</para><para>What have we done? We have taken what my colleague Senator Patterson referred to as $30 billion off the $80 million debts that Labor had racked up, but she meant to say $50 billion and I correct that at her direction. We have taken $50 billion off the $80 billion that the Labor Party had racked up to the taxpayers of Australia. We are going to reduce unemployment further, to 6Â¼ percent. Incidentally, in doing that, in that wonderful single move of reducing that deficit, we have not done that sort of thing for 90 years, not since 1910 and the Scullin government has there been anything like this. And we did it without borrowing any money. The temerity of that opposition to say to us that we have delivered trickery, a pea and thimble trick, to the people of Australia! I find that a bit hard to swallow, when you look at the history of the other side.</para><para>What have we done besides that? Let me get in, in the few minutes that are available to me, something that I think is part of the great budget for the year 2000-01, and that is for older Australians and veterans, whom I have a great interest in. Weekly pensions have been increased by 25 per cent of the total male average weekly earnings. Hearing servicesâand someone on the other side criticised us with respect to hearing services!âwill get $460 million over four years to be spent on ensuring quality hearing services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThat is a reduction, Ross.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>âI am not quite sure whether Senator Carr is interjecting or whether he has got Tourette syndrome.

In particular, I support the remarks made by Senators Cook and Conroy, commenting about the general figures and the false assumptions in this budget. I want to turn to the question I asked of Senator Ellison representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I do it now with even more enthusiasm, in view of the fact that Senator Lightfoot raised the issue of what this budget did for veterans.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lightfoot did not point out somethingâas I in my question to Senator Ellison pointed out. It is true that there was a transfer of the veterans home care service from being administered and run by HACC to now being taken over by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That in itself I would support. I think it is better to have veterans treated in all the services they need by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. However, Senator Lightfoot and Senator Ellison did not point out what is in the budget papers. Certainly, Senator Lightfoot, you were right to say that the budget papers show for the HACC department, on page 112, that the measure of transferring the veterans home care service to the Department of Veterans' Affairs will in fact increase the reach of HACC programs by potentially 20,000 people. That means that they have identified 20,000 veterans who are presently getting HACC support and they will now get it through Veterans' Affairs. Fine.</para><para>But when you go to Budget Paper No. 2 and to the portfolio budget statements dealing with Veterans' Affairs taking over this new program, page 38 of the portfolio statement for Veterans' Affairs says, when you look through the out years, under `Veterans Home Care', that in total $57 million is going to be the savings required or the cuts imposed by this government on veterans. They will have to deliver the same amount of service that HACC delivered, but with $57 million less. That is in the budget paper on page 38 ,and it is also in Budget Paper No. 2 on page 166. You did not see any press statement from the minister giving these figures, nor from the Treasurer. Even though the Treasurer in his budget speech last night mentioned about the transfer to Veterans' Affairs, they did not mention that they had imposed a $57 million cut over four years on how this program is to be delivered.</para><para>What they have imposed on Veterans' Affairs is a disgraceful con trick. They have announced that there is additional money to provide extra services for Vietnam veterans as a result of the morbidity study. The opposition supports that. They have also announced increased benefits for the review of the service entitlements for service men and women from 1955 to 1975 in South-East Asia. That in total comes to an average increase of about $14 million a year. But what they then imposed on Veterans' Affairs was, `You have got to go and find as much savings as you can to pay for this increase.'</para><para>What have they done? They pulled an old trick. They said, `You take over the running of the veterans home care program from HACC, and you've got to find, over four years, savings of $57 million.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>âRubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âIt is in the budget papers, Senator Lightfoot. This is a disgrace to the veterans. It means you either will have to reduce the quality of service and the number of people that can have access to a hospital or you will have to reduce some other benefit that the veterans department has to make up to a total of $57 million. This is a pea and thimble trick. It is an example in the micro of what you have tried to do in the macro in this budgetâusing pea and thimble tricks to hide the reality that there is a structural deficit in the budget. All the assumptions in this budget for the next 12 months are dodgy, as most respected commentators have said. The budget for the veterans affairs department shows that what you have done to veterans in the micro is what you have done in the macro. This is a disgraceful outcome.

In the area of the environmentâan area that the Prime Minister himself has stated is one of major significanceâparticular components of which, such as salinity, are huge problems of national importance, the government's funding commitments do not reflect their rhetoric. Funding for some of the programs such as Waterwatch and Rivercare for the Murray-Darling 2001 program is clearly going downwards, according to the government's own papers, and their forward projections are that it will continue to go down.</para><para>I think that points to the other major looming concern in relation to the government's environment funding: the huge gap that is appearing as the Natural Heritage Trust runs out. Despite the government's commitment at the time the Natural Heritage Trust was established from some of the proceeds of the sale of the first parts of Telstra that no money would be used to replace core program items in the environment department budget, that commitment clearly has not been kept and NHT money clearly has replaced basic core environment department funding over a number of years. That will leave us with a situation where, when the NHT runs out at the end of next year, there will be a massive hole in this country's environment budget at a time when we are slowly starting to realise the enormity of some of the environmental problems that we have and the huge funds that are needed to remedy some of these situations. The Prime Minister's own Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, at their meeting to look into dry land salinity and its impact on rural industries, highlighted the hundreds of millions of dollars cost because of lost productive agricultural land, lost production and other costs to farmers, and yet their overall input into it is decreasing rather than increasing.</para><para>In his answer today to my question, Senator Minchin went on at lengthâas ministers tend to do about some of the government's marvellous environment measures and the funding it has put into themâand congratulated his government on that performance. I think it is worth highlighting that, were it not for the Democrats and the more than one billion dollars we have managed to get out of this government in environment funding as part of various negotiations and agreements in the course of this last year, it would not even be a case of treading water in the environment budget as shown last night; we would have had a massive decrease in the overall funding for the environment. I think it is worth highlighting that the government and the minister, Senator Hill, or his representative, Senator Minchin, should be glad that the Democrats have been forcing the government to spend more than they wish to in these areas, because otherwise they would have absolutely nothing to trumpet in their budget. </para><para>If you look at their overall statement `Investing in our Natural and Cultural Heritage' that was put out last night and all the new measures that are contained in it in terms of overview of funding for the environment, virtually every single one of them was squeezed out of this government by the Democrats. From major expenditure items such as the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Programâover $400 millionâto smaller measures such as the alternative fuels grants scheme, the national biotechnology strategy and the development and commercialisation of renewable energies, virtually all those measures, apart from Adelaide airport noise amelioration, were Democrat initiatives and measures that the government was forced to agree to. It is worth pointing the finger not just at the looming major hole in the environment budget in a couple of years time but at the fact that we are treading water or indeed going slightly backwards in this year's environment budget. Were it not for the Democrats and the multimillion dollar measures that we have managed to get out of this government over the last 12 months, we would indeed have a huge hole present even now. It is a major problem and it is one that the government must fix before the next election. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>14306</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>14306</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><motion><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>	(a)	notes that: </para><para>	(i)	12 May 2000 is Loud Shirt Day, and </para><para>	(ii)	Loud Shirt Day aims to raise community awareness of hearing impairment;</para><para>	(b)	congratulates the Coral Barclay Centre for Children with Hearing Impairment on being awarded the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf Program of the Year 1999, for excellence in services rendered to deaf children and their families;

I will briefly discuss the Committee's highlights of the year. </para><para>This financial year saw the consolidation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's role as the Audit Committee of the Parliament with its new responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act, 1997 coming into effect on 1 January 1998.</para><para>The Committee has long supported the concept of the Auditor-General being an independent officer of the Parliament. In 1996 it tabled a report entitled Guarding the Independence of the Auditor-General which recommended legislative guarantees of audit independence for the Auditor-General and an extension of the Auditor's mandate to include performance audits of Government Business Enterprises. The report also recommended an enhanced role for the Committee in the appointment of the Auditor-General and Independent Auditor and in determining the level of appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office. The Committee's recommendations were incorporated into the present legislation.</para><para>On 4 February 1999 the Committee exercised its review power to approve the appointment of an Independent Auditor for the Commonwealth by holding a public hearing to consider the suitability of the Government's nominee for the position. By means of this approval process the Committee sought assurances that the nominee was suitably qualified for the position, whether there was any existing or potential conflict of interest, the extent of the nominee's experience with audits of Commonwealth agencies, and of the resources available to undertake such audits. After examining the nominee, Mr Michael Coleman of the accounting firm KPMG, the Committee affirmed its approval of the appointment.</para><para>The Committee also considered the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office by means of a slightly revised process. The Committee sought and obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance and Administration to table its Report on the draft estimates before the Budget was brought down on 11 May 1999.</para><para>Inquiry Highlights</para><para>Committee reports tabled during the 1998-99 financial year included those on the New Submarines Project of the Department of Defence, on Asset Management by Commonwealth Agencies and on Australian Government Procurement. In addition two review reports of hearings on Auditor-General Reports for the second and third Quarters of 1997-98 were tabled.</para><para>The Committee was invited to carry out an inspection of one of the Collins Class Submarines by the Managing Director of the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) Mr Hans Ohff. The inspection took place on 28 April 1999. </para><para>In its review of the management of Commonwealth assets the Committee found that a cultural change was needed in order for public servants to better appreciate the value of the assets they manage. Such change should, in the Committee's view, be actively promoted by agency chief executives, as well as by the Department of Finance and Administration through an asset management forum for the sharing of expertise.</para><para>The issue of the management of Commonwealth Government purchasing is the subject of another of the Committee's inquiries for the year. Like asset management, procurement is another function which has been devolved to agencies. The Committee found that the rate of devolution in recent years had resulted in inconsistent service delivery, and in a loss of oversight and coordination of purchasing at the whole of government level. </para><para>Recent Committee inquiries into public service agencies have demonstrated shortcomings with respect to contract management. Such findings are significant in an environment where many government services have been subject to commercial contestability and contracting out and in which responsibility for successful risk management has been devolved to agency heads. The Committee has embarked on an inquiry into contract management in the Australian Public Service in an attempt to identify systemic problems in contract administration and to develop better practice standards which can be applied across agencies.</para><para>The biennial conference of the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committees (ACPAC) held in Fremantle during 22-23 February 1999 provided the JCPAA with the opportunity to brief members of public accounts committees from the States, Territories, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, on the range of its new responsibilities under the amended Public Accounts and Audit Act. The JCPAA Chairman, Mr Bob Charles MP, was elected Chairman of ACPAC for the years 2000-01.</para><para>May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking the secretariat for its support throughout the year.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT 366: Review of Auditor-General's Reports 1997-98, Second Quarter</inline></para><para>As part of this review, the Committee examined two performance audits of the Auditor-General which focused on equity in employment in the Australian Public Service, and matters relating to a contract between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) and South Pacific Cruise Lines Limited (SPCL). </para><para>The JCPAA made four recommendations which were agreed to by the Government.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT 367: Review Of Auditor-General's Reports 1997-98, Third Quarter</inline></para><para>This quarterly report examined three performance audits of the Auditor-General which focused on DEETYA International Services, the sale of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth Airports, and selected functions of the Child Support Agency. The Committee made four recommendations which Government has supported.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REPORT 368: Review Of Audit Report No. 34 1997-98, New Submarine Project, Department Of Defence</inline></para><para>Madam President, the Committee gave top priority to its review of the New Submarine Project. The review examined findings raised by the Auditor-General in Audit Report No. 34. Of the Committee's seven recommendations, six dealt with administrative matters and one with policy issues. The Government has supported the six recommendations relating to administrative matters.</para><para>The Committee's policy recommendation number five is currently under consideration by the Minister for Finance and Administration. As part of this recommendation, the Committee requested that legislative provision be provided for, either through amendment of the Auditor-General Act or the Finance Minister's Orders, to enable the Auditor-General to access the premises of a contractor for the purpose of inspecting and copying documentation and records directly relating to a Commonwealth contract.

It proves the case that the ALP has prosecuted in this place and at estimates committee inquiries for the last two years. It establishes that, as a result of a meeting almost two years ago to this day, the minister leaked to a group of radiologists details of a supply-side budget measure dealing with MRI machines. As a result of him providing information to those radiologists at that meeting on 6 May, they went out and purchased machines. A number of the machines were purchased by members of the committee present at that meeting, but the rest of the industry got to hear of this decision as well. We have evidence that 33 new MRI machines were purchased in the four days following that meeting in the lead-up to the budget, at a cost of about $3 million each. You do not go out and buy an MRI machine off the rack and you do not go out and commit $3 million of your own money unless you are pretty sure you are going to get a return on that money.</para><para>As a result of the meeting on 6 May, those radiologists, and other radiologists who were informed of the decision, knew that they would get a return on their money. How would they get a return on their money? Because the taxpayers of Australia would pay for it through Medicare rebates. The minister leaked information which resulted in every Australian taxpayer in this country having to pay more taxesâhe leaked what was in the budget. The Auditor-General draws the links and makes the case that, as a result of the minister raising that issue in the meeting, the radiologists knew what was in the budget. The minister had got the tick the day before and when he went along to meet with the radiologists to finalise the agreement they were seeking to make on control of radiology measures he gave them this information.</para><para>The Auditor-General found that all of the radiologists at that meeting said that the minister or someone from the government raised this issue. There was a discussion that the budget might include a measure meaning that machines on order at the date of the budgetâon 12 Mayâwould receive Medicare rebates. Only 50 or so machines were currently in operation in Australia at the time, but 33 more machines were ordered in a matter of four days. You do not go out and spend $3 million on a whim or on the basis of a rumour; you go out and spend that if you know something. The radiologists at that meeting knew about this because Dr Wooldridge had told them. He told them, so they were in the know about the budget decision. This is insider trading at its worst and it has cost every taxpayer in this country money.</para><para>The minister has to resign. He has failed all standards required of a minister. He leaked a commercially sensitive decision that cost the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. The Auditor-General has established that case. The Labor Party has pursued this for two years. The minister at every stage has sought to delay the inquiries and has refused to provide answers to avoid a proper investigation, but after three investigations we finally got there. The Auditor-General sets it out chapter and verse. People ought to read this report because it is a stunning indictment of the ministerâit proves that he leaked budget information. In trying to curry favour with the radiologists and in trying to get a deal on longer-term measures, he told them what was in the budget. </para><para>One of the reasons we know that is that the people at the meeting told us, and they gave affidavits to the Auditor-General to establish that. But a whole range of other facts are now being revealed that establish the case that there was a budget leak and that the leak came from the minister. I could never understand, when pursuing this matter, why there was not an investigation. I kept asking the department at estimates: why did you not have the normal budget leak inquiryâcall in the investigators, check telephone records and do all those sorts of things? Do you know why there was no budget leak inquiry? Because they knew who had leaked it. They knew it came from the highest placed person possible in the whole operation: the minister. As a departmental secretary you cannot order an inquiry into a leak when you know that the culprit is the minister. That is why there was never an investigation. In two years there was never a proper investigation into the leak. The best that happened is that a couple of senior officers had a chat. They all agreed that it was not them and they dropped the matter. No-one worried about the millions of dollars it cost taxpayers and no-one bothered to pursue it. Why? Because they knew where the leak had to come from.</para><para>There were only three people present at the meeting where the critical information was passed to the radiologists: the minister, his adviser and one departmental bureaucrat. That bureaucrat, after one round of estimates, was transferred to the blood bank and has not been seen since. We have not been able to question her about what happened. But the key person at that meetingâthe lead negotiator for the governmentâwas the minister. The Auditor-General nails him, and nails him good and proper. He says that, because of that meeting, the radiologists knew and therefore went out and acted. As I say, you do not spend $3 million of yours or anybody else's money unless you know something. They knew that they needed Medicare rebates to make those purchases profitableâto get a return on their money. So they went out and purchased 33 machines. Talk about a Christmas spree!</para><para>That means that they purchased eight machines per day. They were out there buying machines hand over fist. Why would you do that, when there had been only 50 or so machines in Australia in the 20 years before that? They did it because they knew that they were going to get a return. Minister Wooldridge said to them, `You will get a return for your buck because the rebates are in the budget. The Prime Minister signed off on it yesterday, so you are okay.' We also know that the radiologists, as a result of that meeting, signed up to the deal. This was a two-way process: they gave something, so they got something back. The minister's and the department's defence would have us believe that the radiologists signed up to the deal not knowing what was going to happen in terms of the supply of machinesâthat they were somehow that naive that they were going to agree to an arrangement which would cap their income while not knowing how many MRI machines they were going to be able to access to generate that income. You have to accept that they were either very naive or complete fools if they were going to sign up not knowing what his side of the bargain was.</para><para>What we do know is that the minister knew on 6 May because the Prime Minister and cabinet had ticked off on his side of the bargain, and he told them, `The deal can be finalised today because I know what is in the budget. It's all fixed. You blokes will be happy. You can sign the deal.' That is what happened. His actions caused a significant drain on the Commonwealth purse. Millions of dollars were spent on funding MRI rebates on machines that should never have been approved and would never have been purchased without the leak. We know all that. We know that since then they have had to rescind that decision, but again it took almost two years for them to rescind that decision. The minister has tried for the last two years to hide the facts and to deny that the leak occurred. There was no investigation. Only through the opposition pursuing this has this matter come to light. Otherwise, he was hoping that it would blow over, that he would get away with it and that no-one would hold him accountable. Well, he is accountable. He must be held accountable by the parliament, he must be held accountable by the Prime Minister and he must resign. This is one of the most serious offences a minister could be accused of, and the Auditor-General has proved the case. The Auditor-General has established the case that the minister leaked budget information as part of his negotiations with radiologists and that as a result there was a blow-out in the order of machinesâa commercial advantage to many and a huge cost to the taxpayer. </para><para>Despite all the denials that there are any problems and the minister continuing to defend his actions and deny that there has been a problem over the last two years, we have gradually learnt the extent of the problem. We have learnt the fact that there were 50-odd machines ordered over and above what was expected and the fact that many people were in the know because the word got out. But he has denied all this. It has taken three inquiries to finally establish it. I note in the document today that, when questioned by the Auditor-General with some fairly strong legal powers at his control, the minister on this occasion, despite giving very strident denials in the parliament, said, `I can't say I didn't make a comment, but I didn't disclose the mechanisms of supply.' The minister gave a much weaker response when faced with the Auditor-General pressuring him under oath about what might have happened. This is the minister who has denied that there has been a problem for the last two years and has refused to acknowledge the legitimate public policy concerns here.</para><para>We have had three reports into this matter, all providing further evidence of the minister's bungling and complicity in this leak. One was released on Christmas Eve, one was released on the evening before Good Friday and this one has been released the day after the budget. What a trifecta! And this is a minister who is open and accountable! It just so happens that the return to order documents we have been seeking for a year have been tabled this afternoon as well. It is just too damn convenient. This minister is trying to survive what is a damning indictment of his own performance. He is responsible for costing the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. He must go. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>14315</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am absolutely astounded at this ongoing assault on the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge. I would like to see every member of the opposition party go under oath to give evidence in the way the minister did to the Auditor-General. The fact of the matter is that the allegations constantly being made by Senator Evans, Senator Crowley, Senator Faulkner and anyone else who wants to buy into the system are not being made under oath; they are just wild allegations being made under parliamentary privilege. Go outside these doors and make the same allegations against Minister Wooldridge that you have made in here. The answer to that is that you are not game to do so. As part of the 1998 budget, the minister announced that an important new technology named magnetic resonance imaging would be funded under the MBS.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âThe Labor Party might like to listen for five seconds. They might actually want to know the truth. This announcement was part of a bigger diagnostic imaging package which the Labor Party had completely overlooked for the people of Australia. The people of Australia wanted access to MRI at a reasonable cost. What Minister Wooldridge was trying to do with this policy and what he has actually achieved with this policy is to make that facility available to more Australians at a reasonable cost. That has covered up for a Labor Party failure of 13 years in government when they refused to make such a tool available for imaging. Now there are 17 units accessing public funding in non-metropolitan areas.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âHere we have Senator Crowley interjecting again. She does not listen, she did not hear what I said, she has not read the report and still she is trying to correct something that is wrong. It would be lovely if Senator Crowley would go under oath just to wake up in the morning. I want to make sure that the Senate knows the facts surrounding this. Dr Wooldridge was the one who asked the Auditor-General to inquire into the processes surrounding the development of the 1998 budget measure on MRI and the diagnostic imaging package. It was Minister Wooldridge who set the inquiry in train. The Auditor-General has now released the report of the inquiry into the probity and effectiveness of the arrangements to improve access to MRI. Minister Wooldridge has recognised and thanked the Auditor-General for undertaking such a comprehensive process in a relatively short time frame. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to remind the Senate that this report was requested by the minister, not by anybody else. According to the report, the minister wrote to the Auditor-General on 18 October requesting `an audit inquiry into, and reporting on, the probity of the processes surrounding the negotiation of the agreement between the government and the diagnostic imaging profession'. The minister specifically asked the Auditor-General to focus on accusations that people had inappropriate access to budget information that would have given them commercial advantage. The report says that the minister also indicated that `he would welcome any observations the Auditor-General may have about how similar processes might best be handled in the future'. The minister also agreed to a request by the Auditor-General to extend the scope of the audit to `put beyond doubt the Auditor-General's authority to cover the role of the minister and that of his staff' in the process. In short, the minister has nothing to hide. It is in the interests of good government that there be an open and transparent process. That is what the Labor Party do not like. That is not the way they operate. In this regard, the Auditor-General has undertaken a very thorough inquiry.</para><para>As the Auditor-General's inquiry was operating under sections 18 and 20 of the act, he was able to review all relevant documents in the department, the HIC and the minister's officeâincluding retrieved electronic communicationsâand to undertake over 75 personal interviews with the minister, his staff, government officials and radiologists. Where the Auditor-General felt it necessary, evidence was taken under oath. The minister gave evidence under oath, yet the Labor Partyâwho have not shut up for one second since I stood upâstill will not say why they will not commit any evidence to oath.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âIs there any chance that Senator Ray might be shut up in this debate so that I can make some comments?

I note the Auditor-General makes reference to a number of findings and conclusions in relation to the process. In summary, these are as follows. There was:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>... no substantive conclusion about inappropriate disclosure of budget sensitive information ...</para></quote><para>How did Senator Evans, Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner, Senator Crowley and all the rest of them get from the report that the minister is guilty? It is not in there. The report states:</para><quote><para>The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.</para></quote><para>It further states:</para><quote><para>... the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstance ...</para></quote><para>It further states:</para><quote><para>There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department ...</para></quote><para>It further states that the investigation by the HIC could have been more effectively managed and that the HIC's procedures for managing the perceived conflict of interest of board members did not work appropriately on all occasions. </para><para>With respect to each of these conclusions, I want to make the following point: there was no leak. The report states that no substantive conclusion can be drawn in the light of contradictory evidence. In particular, the Auditor-General found that:</para><quote><para>All participants agree that the Minister did not discuss what measures would be in the Budget.</para></quote><para>That is paragraph 76, for the Labor Party's reference. Again, the Auditor-General reports: </para><quote><para>All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agree that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures.</para></quote><para>That is paragraph 2.27, for the Labor Party, who cannot read. Further, the report states:</para><quote><para>... there is no evidence that the Minister had any discussions between 6 May and Budget day with any parties outside of government with respect to MRI supply measures ...</para></quote><para>The inquiry's findings in this regard are clear. The minister stands by his statements to the House of Representatives and elsewhere and the evidence he has given under oath that neither he nor the officers accompanying him at the meeting on 6 May 1998 leaked any information about the supply-side controls to apply to MRI machines. The Auditor-General also notes that the recollections of most participants in the various discussions do not support the view that the Commonwealth's consideration of the option of including machines on order as at budget night was discussed with the college prior to the budget. Nor is there any record of any such discussion, including amongst the college records. So let the issue of the leak be put to rest. It just did not happen. But that does not stop the Labor Party claiming that it did. They simply will not read the report. They simply will not look at the way in which the Auditor-General has investigated this matter. </para><para>Any process of high-level negotiation carries with it some element of risk. As the ANAO notes in paragraph 34:</para><quote><para>High level risks ... were in the overall context identified and managed. However, insufficient consideration was given to risk identification and management for some aspects of the policy development process ...</para></quote><para>The key point is that the design of the policy responded to the risks identified. The department put into place a number of eligibility criteria, including siting arrangements, accreditation requirements and comprehensive clinical indicators. There had to be unconditional and enforceable contracts in place at 7.30 p.m. on 12 May, and this had to be attested to by way of statutory declaration. As a result of these measures, the HIC has been able to carry out its investigations, which have resulted in 19 referrals to the DPP. In view of the larger than expected number of applications for eligibility, the minister acted to enforce a cut-off date of 11 October 1999 for these applications. Further, the minister then acted to change the eligibility date from 12 May to 10 February 1998, which was the time that negotiations with the college commenced. As soon as the minister was advised that there were problems on the order side, he took appropriate and decisive action to ensure the government's objectives could be met without putting the taxpayer at risk. </para><para>In summary, risks were identified and responded to appropriately. The report recognises:</para><quote><para>... the policy was properly authorised and ... the Department met the formal requirements of the Budget process.</para></quote><para>However, there was clearly inadequate documentation of the negotiations with the college and of the development of the supply-side measure itself. This is a matter that the minister has asked his department to pay particular attention to, but this shortcoming is not characteristic of his department in any way, shape or form. The HIC investigations are important. The minister is exceedingly disappointed at the length of time it took the HIC to undertake their investigation. However, the HIC had to be thorough, be fair to all parties and follow a proper process. The magnitude of the possible fraud surprised everyone, not least the HIC investigators. The paper trail was extensive and complex, the number of people that needed to be interviewed was large and there were conflicting stories. The minister is now satisfied that everything that could have been done was done. The matter is now with the DPP, and we should await the conclusions of that process. </para><para>On the issue of potential conflicts of interest at the HIC board level, paragraph 119 of the report states that the ANAO found no evidence `that the course of the investigation was influenced improperly'. The minister has asked the HIC board to follow up with the audit conclusions on governance matters. It is important to recognise that the Auditor-General's findings and conclusions focus only on the role played by the government in the development of the MRI measure. While the minister is disappointed that an inquiry needed to be undertaken at all, the minister is pleased there has been no evidence found of wrongdoing on the part of the governmentâno evidence whatsoever. For the Labor Party to continue to come in here and say that this report contains evidence is plainly wrong.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âIt is not going to do their image any good. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âThat is precisely right, Senator Calvert.

Naturally, the Auditor-General's report does not go to the probity of the actions of non-government players. Broadly speaking, the minister is sure that all parties acted in good faith. Other processes, such as the investigations being undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission, should help to complete the picture in relation to actions of particular individuals. But this government did not sit on its hands, unlike Labor; the minister did not sit on his hands. The minister has substantially improved access to MRI at the same time as reining in unsustainable expenditure on diagnostic imaging that ran out of control under Labor.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator Crowley</name></talker><para>âOh dear, oh dear. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>âSenator Crowley could not care less what went out of control under Labor. That is why when she was a minister she was called `dozy Rosy'. Notwithstanding particular shortcomings in departmental processes, the overall outcome is a very good one for the Australian public. That is not what the Labor Party are concerned about. The outcomes for the Australian public do not worry them in the slightest. At each step along the way, the minister took action where it was needed and as advised by his department vis-a-vis: the overall agreement with the college; the tightening of the supply-side measures, particularly the statutory declarations; the HIC investigation and report to him; the 11 October cut-off of applications for equipment eligibility; the shifting back of the date for eligible orders from the budget to 10 February 1998; the commissioning of the Auditor-General's report; and the bringing forward of the review of MRI, the Blandford report. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In short, the government should be applauded for the measures it has taken for they are delivering a good result for the Australian public. Not once in all of thisâI have chaired all the meetings that have been conducted into this inquiryâhave the Labor Party recognised the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. It will be interesting today to see whether they finally recognise the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. They failed after 13 years of government to deliver this facility at a reasonable cost. That is what this government has done. And now Labor can do nothing but criticise and be petty and paltry, calling for a minister's resignation over something that is right and proper and over something which he has been proven to be correct.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>14318</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Knowles has had the benefit of a speech provided by the department and minister, who have had this Auditor-General's Report No. 42 into MRI services in their hands for over a monthâplenty of time, you would think, to prepare a minister's defence on an issue like this. But this report is so condemnatory of the minister, so scathing of the minister, that no defence can be provided even if you have a month to look at the draft report provided by the Auditor-General. I want to briefly take the Senate back to the history of this MRI issue. </para></talk.start><para>Two years ago the Minister for Health and Aged Care went to a meeting at night in the Sydney office of the Royal College of Radiologists. It was one week prior to the 1998 budget, and the topic of conversation there was a cosy chat about what was going to be in the budget. Amazingly, no notes were kept of that critical meeting. The claim is that no secrets were let slip but, in the following four days, no fewer than 33 new orders were paid for MRI machines.  </para><para>For two years, the minister has fought desperately to keep the lid on this ministerial scandal, this growing MRI scam. The opposition, quite rightly, have fought relentlessly in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. We have asked dozens of questions; we have raised the issues at successive estimates hearings; and, bit by bit, we have winkled the truth out on this issue. The handling of the MRI issue is part of a pattern of Minister Wooldridge's. This is how Minister Wooldridge does business: he has acted without regard to the public interest; he has stonewalled when he has been questioned; he has refused to admit there has been a problem; and he delayed time and time again in deciding to establish a proper inquiry.</para><para>We have had three inquiries. We have had the Health Insurance Commission inquiry report released on Christmas Eve, which found that grounds existed to prepare briefs for prosecution in 19 cases involving up to 250 radiologists and that civil recovery of funds was required in a further eight cases. We will hear the full story of that, of course, only when those cases go to court. Then we had the report by Professor Blandford that was released on the evening before Good Friday. He confirmed what the minister was told, before he started down the road of giving private radiologists access to an MRI Medicare rebate, that Australia has enough machines already and another seven could fill any gaps in rural Australia. Instead, because of Minister Wooldridge's process, we have had over 40 surplus MRI machines and we have had a financial headache and scandal not only for the government but also for the radiologists and their bankers. </para><para>Now we have the Auditor-General's report pushed out on the day after the budget is brought down to try to minimise the political impact of the scandal that is engulfing the minister for health in the Australian government. That is just a continuation of the cover-up tactics that we have seen from Dr Wooldridge for so long. The government knows that the Senate itself will not be meeting for another few weeks, and the minister hopes he can avoid scrutiny by hiding behind coverage of the budget.</para><para>What we have here is a pattern. This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This minister has a very peculiar inability to spot a conflict of interest. He could not see a conflict in having his department negotiate multimillion dollar contracts with the people who were potential beneficiaries. He could not see a conflict in meeting with his friends in the College of Radiologists to discuss budget secrets. No, he could not see a conflict in appointing Dr Barry Catchlove, a man who had just ordered six MRI machines, to the position of chairman of the Health Insurance Commission. He could not see a conflict in appointing his fundraiser, Dr Rick McLean, to the position of chair of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council on $25,000 a year. He could not see a conflict in awarding his friend and supporter, Dr Jack Best, contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars without public tender. That is the way this minister does business. </para><para>There is a pattern with this minister of shonky political fundraising and letting those in the medical profession buy political access to the minister for health. Of course, it is the same with the radiologists, and it is going on. Dr Wooldridge delivered a budget briefing at a fundraiser in Sydney for an organisation chaired by his friend Dr Best. It is still going on. At this fundraiser was Dr McLeanâthey are all in it together. What did Dr Wooldridge extol at a recent budget briefing? None other than the work of Dr Best done at a cost to the taxpayer of $230,000 with travel expenses of over $80,000. Dr Best has undertaken a publicly funded stocktake of rural health that is now being used as a blueprint for the Liberal Party to restore its sinking stocks in the bush.</para><para>This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This is the Dr Wooldridge pattern: `You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.' That is Dr Wooldridge's approach and he has now been exposed by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is scathing about the department, too. Look what he says in paragraph 34:</para><quote><para>The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 35 says: </para><quote><para>The ANAO concluded that the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstances.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 36 of the A-G's report says:</para><quote><para>There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department of the negotiations with the College.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 36 goes on:</para><quote><para>Official records were not taken or maintained of some significant briefings of, and decisions by, the Minister.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 38 states:</para><quote><para>There were 33 machines ordered in the four working days between 7 and 12 May (Budget night) 1998, according to statutory declarations provided to the HIC ... the possibility of some prior knowledge of, or speculation about, the inclusion of machines on order in the MRI Budget measure cannot be ruled out.</para></quote><para>Paragraph 40 states:</para><quote><para>It is noteworthy that five of the eleven radiologists involved in the negotiations were associated with practices that allegedly ordered nine machines prior to the Budget.</para></quote><para>Senator Knowles, in her prepared statement, asked where the Auditor-General says that Dr Wooldridge is guilty. I will tell you where the Auditor-General says that. He says it in paragraph 42 of his report:</para><quote><para>Statements have also been made by College representatives who attended the meeting on 6 May 1998 with the Minister that, although the Minister did not reveal what measures would be in the Budget, there was discussion of the option to include machines on order as at Budget night. All but one have stated that this was initiated by the Minister (the other has indicated this was initiated by the Minister or the departmental official present) within the general context of College concerns about restrictions on sites ... On the other hand, the Minister, the Minister's adviser and the departmental officer present, dispute the radiologists' recollection of the meeting. They do not recall the specific matter of machines on order being discussed. Against this background, including related developments over the preceding month, the meeting of 6 May 1998 seems to have had some influence on the following surge in orders for machines, either directly or indirectly.</para></quote><para>Senator Knowles and the government ask where Dr Wooldridge is found guilty by the Auditor-General. Where is Dr Wooldridge found guilty by the Auditor-General? In paragraph 42 of his report. </para><para>If you do not like paragraph 42, go to paragraph 43, where the Auditor-General says:</para><quote><para>... the ANAO considers that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence does at least suggest that negotiation and consultation with the College representatives and open debate on supply control issues created an environment where some participants may have deduced, or actually become aware, that the Commonwealth was giving consideration to the inclusion of machines on order in the Budget measure.</para></quote><para>That is what he says. The Auditor-General says Minister Wooldridge is guilty. Of course Minister Wooldridge should go. Minister Wooldridge should go because the Auditor-General has set out in scathing terms in his report why he should resign and why, if he does not resign, the Prime Minister should take the appropriate action. Perhaps the Prime Minister might even consider his discredited Code of Ministerial Conduct, which says:</para><quote><para>It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in them or the government.</para></quote><para>Dr Wooldridge has. Further, it states:</para><quote><para>Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. </para></quote><para>Minister Wooldridge has not been honest in his public dealings and has consistently misled the Australian public and the parliament. Under the heading of `Accountability' it states:</para><quote><para>Ministers do, however, have overall responsibility for the administration of their portfolios and for carriage in the Parliament of their accountability obligations arising from that responsibility. They would properly be held to account for matters for which they were personally responsible, or where they were aware of problems but had not acted to rectify them.</para></quote><para>Dr Wooldridge not only is personally responsible and personally has to take the rap but also has to take the rap for his department on this one. He was right in there, and so was his personal staff, from the very beginning.</para><para>This is the administrative equivalent of insider trading. This affair shows an abject failure on the part of Dr Wooldridge, a minister of the Crown. It has taken the opposition almost two years to uncover all the detail about the scan scam. But we have worked assiduously on that and we have done very well, even with all the attempts that have been made by Dr Wooldridge and the government to cover up, not to answer questions, not to provide documents and not to respond to orders of the Senate. But, finally, the Auditor-General has come down with a report that finds Dr Wooldridge guilty of the charges that the opposition have made, which leaves Dr Wooldridge with no alternative but to resign. The facts in this multimillion dollar scan scam are now public for all. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âWho will do the fundraising?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âI do not know, Senator Ray, who will do the fundraising. But I do know this: the fundraising is part of the pattern of Dr Wooldridge's conduct. Dr Wooldridge operates on this principle: you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours. That is the Wooldridge approach to ministerial responsibility. That is how he conducts himself and that is how he conducts his ministerial affairs. He has to go. He has to go directly because of his revelation to the radiologists of the details of the budget supply-side measure and particularly because of the fact concerning the number of MRI machines on order on budget night. Five or six radiologists at the meeting have indicated that the minister himself initiated this discussion. You have a situation where the Auditor-General is convinced that this disclosure is what led radiologists to get their orders in before budget night and directly resulted in 33 orders for MRI machines in the four days prior to the budget. The Auditor-General says in his report that this minister himself was deeply involved in insider trading of market sensitive information with millions of taxpayers' dollars at stake.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But, secondly, this minister ought to go for his maladministration of his own department. He has to take the rap for the administrative failures in the department of health and the administrative failures in the negotiations with the radiologistsâduring many of which he and members of his staff were present. What a disgraceful performance from the minister for health. If ever a minister should go, this minister should. Minister Wooldridge must resign. The Prime Minister must ensure, under his much-discredited code of ministerial responsibility, that Dr Wooldridge resigns today.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 11) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>14321</page.no><id.no>R980</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>14321</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>14321</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>14321</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><quote><para>This Bill makes amendments to the income tax law to give effect to the following measures: </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">International tax agreements</inline></para><para>This measure will implement the amendment announced in the Treasurer's Press Release of 27 April 1998 by changing the <inline font-style="italic">International Tax Agreements Act 1953</inline> to require that the tax treaties be interpreted in accordance with their intention of maintaining Australia's taxing rights over alienations or effective alienations of real property situated in Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Capital gains tax corrections and other minor amendments</inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The Bill will also make some minor amendments and correct some unintended consequences that occurred when the capital gains tax and certain other provisions were rewritten as part of the Tax Law Improvement Project.

I look forward to your informed contribution on this bill shortly. The purpose of subsection (4) provides that an order may not be made under these provisions if the only ground for making the order is that creditors of the company have relied on the fact that another company is, or has been, a related body corporate of the company. This amendment is aimed specifically at corporate entities which seek to restructure and avoid their financial responsibility to employees. More specifically, the bill addresses the circumstances of the corporate restructuring undertaken by Patricks in 1998 when sacking its work force. The employees of Patricks labour hire companies were left basically without any claim to accrued entitlements like annual leave and sick leave, redundancy payments and long service leave. These accrued entitlements could only be made against their direct employer, who was now a Patricks company in receivership. Any employee of a corporation is potentially at risk of this type of corporate restructuring.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said earlier, the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities heard evidence that the use of this type of corporate restructuring is increasing at an alarming rate. Labor does not accept that employers have the right to artificially manipulate their corporate entity to avoid their legal obligations to their employees and accordingly has moved this amendment. This provision will give greater security to employees in relation to their accrued legal entitlements. This amendment is necessary and it is urgent. The number of companies going into external administration is increasing, and it is becoming only too clear that those companies are failing to make the provisions for employee entitlements. One company with which I am familiar and have dealt with is a transport company called Gosch, who restructured themselves into two companiesâone hiring the employees and the other contracts. They unfortunately were placed into external administration, and the company employees were unfortunately going to receive almost nothing as part of a corporate structure. I simply wish to make it clear to the chamber that this is not an isolated situation, it is not an unusual situation and it is certainly not restricted to textile companies or waterfront companies. It is a common standard tactic across corporate Australia. </para><para>The amendment Labor is proposing is a sensible amendment. The court, in exercising its discretion as to whether to make an order that a related body corporate pay the whole debt of an insolvent company, is only to exercise its discretion when it is just to do so. Subsection (2) of the new section lists some matters for the court to consider. These matters respect the fact that in Corporations Law each company is a separate legal entity. However, the court should be permitted to raise the corporate veil between related body corporates in certain circumstances, and the courts have demonstrated that there will be circumstances when that is appropriate. In this amendment the Labor Party is also saying that there are circumstances when it is appropriate to make a corporation liable for the debts of their related body corporate. It is appropriate to raise the corporate veil when the corporate entity has been artificially manipulated to avoid legal obligations owed to employees. This new provision will give greater security to employees in relation to accrued legal entitlements. This amendment should be supported. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>14325</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor Party amendment before the committee is very similar to the Australian Democrats amendment  which has been circulated in respect of this bill and is in the same terms as amendments I moved to the Company Law Review Bill 1997 and the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998. I will briefly encapsulate the history of those amendments. When I moved those amendments in the committee stage of the Company Law Review Bill 1997 they were supported by Labor, but when the bill came back from the House the amendments were not insisted on by Labor and therefore fell away. When I moved them again to the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998 and the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998, both Labor and the coalition rejected them. So I am pleased and the Australian Democrats are pleased that these amendments have come back largely in the form we put them in and that they now have full Labor support to such an extent that they are moving them. Given the similarity of my amendment to the Labor amendment, if Labor's amendment is successful, I will not be moving mine. If theirs is not successful, then there will be no point in moving mine. Either way, my amendment will not be moved. Therefore, I formally advise the chamber that I will withdraw my amendment. </para></talk.start><para>The Labor amendment has the effect of providing a court with a discretion to make related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company after having regard to a number of factors. The matters to which the court must have regard are: the extent to which the related company takes part in the management of the company, the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company generally and the creditors to which the debt or liability relates, and the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company are attributable to the actions of the related body corporate. These kinds of matters have been around ever since the 1988 Law Reform Commission's inquiry into these very factors. So it has had a long gestation. From those factors it can be seen that it is not merely the relationship between the two companies that gives rise to liability; it is the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the insolvent company. That is very importantâit is not the relationship but the conduct. This bill, from the government's perspective and in terms of Labor's amendments, is very much related to conduct. That is an important point to make. </para><para>The ill that we are attempting to address in this Labor amendment is entities structuring themselves in such a way as to avoid liability or responsibilities by interposing companies with little capital backing between creditors, employees and the company within the group which has substantial assetsâin other words, deliberately restructuring themselves and then conducting themselves in a manner by which they can avoid their obligations to creditors, particularly employees. In 1988 the Law Reform Commission conducted a general insolvency inquiry. As part of that inquiry, the commission considered the possibility of making related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company in certain circumstances, and the commission recommended that companies should be so liable. The commission produced a draft section and that draft was the basis of our amendments in 1997 and 1998 and the Labor amendment today. </para><para>The government has made it known to us that the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee, CASAC, is presently considering the issue of court ordered contributions and the recommendations of the general insolvency inquiry. I am heartened that that consideration is taking place. However, I have no reason to believe that the issues that CASAC is considering will differ from the issues considered by the Law Reform Commission some 12 years ago. We all know what the history has been of these kinds of transactions not only over the last few years but also over a couple of decades. We feel it is time to take action on the issue. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will support Labor's amendment No. 1 on sheet 1779 revised. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14326</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government will be opposing the amendment. It is interesting to have the history of this amendment from the Harmer committee from 1988 retold to us by Senator Murray, because Senator Murray continues to highlight the Labor Party's lack of consistency on this proposal. To the extent that Labor have refused to support this amendment almost year in, year out, for the last 11 or 12 years, they have shown some consistency, but the fact is that when their union mates have obviously put their heavies on to them they have changed their minds.</para></talk.start><para>That highlights a couple of facts. As you know well, Mr Chairman, most members of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate are former union officials and well over 60 per cent of the voting stock in Australian Labor Party preselections is held by the unions. The unions have the ALP as a wholly owned subsidiary and related group. There is no doubt that the union movement still controls the Labor Party. We will see this of course at their national conference when the Labor Party are dictated to in regard to their policies for the next election wholly and solely by the trade union movement, who control the Australian Labor Party. They are very unlike the modern Labour Party led by Tony Blair in Great Britain. They have a leader who had the guts and fortitude to ensure that the Labour Party in Great Britain spread their network of people, spread their network of members, encouraged working men and women who were not members of unions to join the Labour Party and encouraged working men and women in the suburbs to have an influence on Labour Party policy. He got rid of the union movement's insidious control of the Labour Party in Great Britain. They had a forward looking leader for the next millennium in Tony Blair. They had a character who was prepared to recognise that the trade union influence on the Labour Party in Great Britain was an insidious dead hand on policy development.</para><para>In Australia, you have no such leadership. So policy is not made in the caucus room in this parliament; policy for the Australian Labor Party is made up in the back bar of the Breakfast Creek Hotel and in union meetings in smoke filled rooms by faceless men in the Australian Labor Party. That is exactly what has happened here. I do not need to actually retell all the history, because Senator Murray has done it perfectly. When Mr Harmer's committee reported in 1988 and said, `This is a good idea; this is what you should do; this is how you should protect employee entitlements,' what did the Australian Labor Party government do? They said, `No, we are not going to do that.' There were very good reasons why they chose not to do it, and that is why the government will be opposing it now: it basically destroys the entire concept of the corporation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âIt says that, if one corporation incurs debts and liabilities, another corporationâan entirely different legal entity under the Labor Party's loopy proposalâwould be responsible for those debts and liabilities.

He does not do his homework or study. He comes into debates with a cursory knowledge of the subject and tries to wing his way through them.

He has come in here twice in the last three years and said, `No, we are not going to support this.' He would not support Senator Murray's amendments, but he comes in now and says, on behalf of his party, that they are going to support it. But for years and years in government they did not do this. It is a bit like their approach to deficits and surpluses. They have become experts on surpluses now and on whether you can have a good surplus or a bad surplus.

I think they have run about three surpluses in all of the years that they have been in office federally since about World War II. They are the biggest borrowers in Australian history. Year after year, they have spent tens of billions of dollars and, all of a sudden, when it comes to employee entitlements, it is exactly the same behaviour.

This has to do with the Labor Party's hypocrisy. In other words, `Do not do what we did in government; do not look at what we did in government.' Except for Senator Peter Cook, all of them are very embarrassed about what happened under the Hawke and Keating years. When Mr Crean was asked, `What did you do with asset sales? What did you do with spectrum receipts when you were in government?' he said, `We are not in government; they are in government. Don't talk about that,' and quickly changed the subject.' Ask Mr Crean and the Labor Party what they did about employee entitlements when they were in government, and the answer is absolutely nothing. All of a sudden you have a Liberal-National Party coalition government that is doing more about employee entitlements in four years than these blokes even thought about doing in 13 years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have these amendments to the Corporations Law and we have the Employee Entitlement Support Schemeâtwo very important initiatives which will supply real, deliverable support for employees, support that you can touch and feel, and all in less than four years of a Liberal-National government. What did Labor do in 13 years? Nothing. Mr Harmer said, `Here is a report. This is what you can do,' and still you did nothing. It must be very embarrassing to turn up, if you are a Queensland senator, in the Breakfast Creek Hotel or into a trades hall anywhere in Australia and to have your union mates in the Labor Party saying, `Look, this coalition government is actually doing quite a good thing.' I have spoken to Greg Combet about this. I said to him, `What do you say to your mates in the Senate now about why they didn't act on Harmer?' I have got to say that Greg Combet will not say this publicly but he will say it privately: he will reinforce that the Keating and Hawke governments' performance in relation to employee entitlements was a disgrace. It must very embarrassing. So no wonder, Senator Murray, that they have been dragged kicking and screaming to support your amendment.</para><para>They do not have the humility to support your amendment. They have to write their ownâor grab yours, probably. They probably found an old copy floating around from the Financial Sector Reform Bill. Senator Conroy probably told someone to find Murray's amendment, and they got the old white ink out and coloured it out, got their crayon out and wrote Senator Conroy's name where he had rubbed yours out. They could have at least said, `We've looked at Senator Murray's amendment and, after 12 years of consideration, we have come to our senses and Senator Murray is right.' But no, they have to write their own one, change a few words, get the white ink out, get the crayon or the pencilâI do not think they have let Senator Conroy loose with a biro yet: I think he has just gone from crayons to pencils. </para><para>So the government will not support this amendment. I say that, very importantly, for all of the reasons that the Hawke government opposed the Harmer reforms, for all the good reasons the Keating opposed these reformsâbecause you effectively destroy the foundational corporations principlesâwe will not be doing this. The government will not allow the employee entitlements bill to pass into law if the Senate passes this amendment. I say again that we will not allow it to pass into law. So those senators who take the decision to destroy the fundamental corporate concept by breaking down the legal entity of a corporation will in effect ensure that the benefits of this legislation will not flow to employees around Australia. We have very carefully looked at how you construct a regime to protect employees by amending the Corporations Law. We believe that our amendments provide a significant improvement to those protections. We believe not only that the amendment would significantly hurt the underpinnings of the principles of the Corporations Law by breaking down the boundaries around a corporate entity but that it has a number of other significant flaws in it. They do leave bodies corporate liable for any debts and not just those relating to employee entitlements, and so it opens up a Pandora's box there.</para><para>The amendment is framed very broadly and will leave bodies corporate with an unascertainable and potentially unbounded liability for the debts of related insolvent companies. The proposed amendment provides little meaningful guidance to a court and, more importantly, to directors of companies in group structures. The amendment begs the question of what is just and from whose perspective the court is to consider it. In contrast, the provisions in the bill as it stands focus on the protection of employee entitlements where there is a deliberate attempt to avoid their payment. The protection is available even where the company in question is not insolvent, making it a proactive protection. The government's amendment targets the objectionable conduct in relation to protection of employee entitlements. It is not a bill that targets the liability of corporate groups generally.</para><para>I also say that the ALP amendment, while it on the one hand seeks to broaden the scope of liability, also has the effect of being more narrow than the government's proposed amendment. The government's proposed offence has coverage beyond group companies and related bodies corporate. It can apply to any person who enters into an agreement or transaction for the purpose of avoiding or reducing payment of employee entitlements. Under the general principles of criminal law, a penalty could be imposed on people who aid or abet a breach of the provision.</para><para>It is also important for the record to note that the Corporations Law already provides substantial protections against asset stripping by related companies. The law provides that holding companies can be liable for debts incurred by the subsidiaries while insolvent, and this places sensible and usable restrictions on the liability of companies for debts of their subsidiaries. The government's bill will widen this duty to cover uncommercial transactions as well as debts.</para><para>Senator Murray referred to the consideration by CASAC of corporate groups, and the issues that have been mentioned by me and Senator Murray would clearly fall within the ambit of CASAC's inquiry. There is no way that the government would seek to pre-empt the advisory committee's consideration of these issues. Why have an advisory committee advising on these important issues that are related to the amendments before us and then just ignore that work? You might as well close CASAC down. Very many eminent people spend hours, days and months of their time, cumulatively, advising the government and the parliament on these mattersâas people like Senator Cooney would know better than just about anybody in this chamber. That is not to say that their decisions or opinions will ultimately be accepted by the government or the parliament; but why would you even have an advisory committee if, in a pre-emptive way, you just ignore their consideration? It sends a very bad message to the good men and women of Australia who put themselves forward to serve on those committees, only for the government to say, `Stuff you; we'll do it anyway.' </para><para>We in this government will never ignore the regime put in place in the national corporations scheme put in place by the federal Labor government and supported by, as I again recognise, Senator Cooney as the then chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Committee who was responsible for that legislation to establish Australia's corporate scheme. We will not ignore the sound requirementâas you, Mr Chairman, would appreciate more than most in this placeâto seek, through consultation and approval of any measure in relation to the Corporations Law particularly as it pertains to the former jurisdiction of the states in this matter, the approval of the Ministerial Council of Corporations, a body made up of the attorneys-general of each state, a body put in place to ensure that this is a truly national scheme. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>14329</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Ian Campbell has spoken about the concept of corporations and about the fact that people's ideas on what should be the responsibility of corporations change as time goes by. I think that is correct. Corporations Law is a member of a group of issues that keep changing. We will be debating in the future and we have debated in the past laws that relate to workplace relations. They change as different situations arise. Matters dealing with compensation for people injured in the workplace is another area in which the laws keep changing to try to cover issues that arise in particular contexts. The Family Law Act is another one that is constantly changing as peopleâlegislators, judgesâstrive to obtain a result that meets the need then expressed. And so it is with the legislation that the government brings forward on this occasion, that is, the <inline ref="R992">Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000</inline>. This bill put forward by the government changes the Corporations Law in dramatic ways and visits quite significant penalties on people who would deny employees their benefitsâjust benefits that they have earned through the sweat of their brow.</para></talk.start><para>The concept of the corporation, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, originally was that people who were the owners of an enterprise and who were also workers in the enterprise who benefited from the enterprise and managed the enterprise would be protected from ruin if they went about their business in a proper fashion and without harming other people in a deliberate or negligent way. It was thought that people who went about their business in that way should be protected from ruin if their business did not succeed as well as it might have. Originally, the concept of a corporation was one where the owner, the workers and the people who benefited were all of the same identity. Since then it has developed to the point where the managers of companies are not the only owners; you have got shareholders and you have got people who buy in and out of the company to take such benefits as they can, and they are separate from the people who actually manage the company. So it has become quite complex. You have companies owning companies, you have companies that are closely related in the sense that they might have common directors and you have people who are directors of one being very influential in the other. It is always a case by case matter as to whether a particular companyâparticularly related companiesâis related in such a way that it should take responsibility for the debt of the company in which it has influence. In other words, if we talk about this in terms of company A and company B, are company A and company B, although separate identities, so closely related that one should take responsibility for the other? That is a difficult question, and it is a matter that should be decided on a case by case basis. The amendment that has been suggested by Senator Conroy, 588YA, attempts to overcome the problem of when is A properly liable for the debts of B and when is it not.</para><para>This particular amendment leaves that question up to the decision of the court, and that is a very proper approach to take in this instance. The courts, may I sayâif I can digress for a minuteâbuilt up a lot of the law that relates to companies; a lot of the company law that we now operate under began in the courts. You will remember the debate that took place in the eighties and early nineties about whether company legislation should leave everything up to `fuzzy law', as was said, which meant that general principles were set out in the act, the various instances that arose that led to problems were dealt with by the judges and the judges continued to make the precedents that they had up until then, or whether it should be black-letter law. I remember the Attorney-General at the time was Mr Duffy, a very eminent Attorney-General, may I say, and a very eminent lawyer. He, I think, favoured the black-letter approach, although a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in business said that the fuzzy law was the right approach. This section put forward by Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition is one that is, I think, a fuzzy law type. It is appropriate that it is, because it is very difficult to state as a matter of general principle when a particular company should take responsibility for the debts of another company. This sets out in subsection (2) certain principles that should guide it. They are not exhaustive because they include these four points, but they are inclusive rather than definitive of what the courts might take into account. </para><para>But, as I said before, the courts are used to this; it is their bread and butter. The Federal Court has been quite brilliant in this area, and it is a great pity that a lot of their jurisdiction in this area is going to be taken away following the Wakim case. But the Federal Court has produced quite brilliant judgments on this. The supreme courts of the various states have decided these issues for over a century. It goes back to the English courts, which developed the principles that we now look to. This is a good provision. May I say, it is not devoted simply to people who have been left in a disastrous state because their remuneration, their wages, their long service leave and what have you have not been paid. It simply says this:</para><quote><para>(1)When a company is being wound up in insolvency, the liquidator, a creditor of the company or the Commission may apply to the Court for an order that a company that is, or has been, a related body corporate pay to the liquidator the whole or part of the amount of a debt of the insolvent company. The Court may make such an order if it is satisfied that it is just to do so.</para></quote><para>Far from being a radical clause, it is a conventional clause in the sense that it deals with a problem in a conventional way. That is illustrated by the fact that it will be set out in that part of the Corporations Law that deals with these sorts of issues. I just go down the index of the contents of the Corporations Law in the area where this particular amendment will go. The headings read: Division 1âPreliminary; Division 2âVoidable transactions; Division 3âDirectors' duty to prevent insolvent trading; Division 4âDirector liable to compensate company; Proceedings against director; Proceedings by creditor; Liability of holding company for insolvent trading by subsidiary; and so on. This will fit neatly into this area and give the courts the proper opportunity of deciding when a company should pay up in justice. To simply say this is anything but a reasonable proposition is, I think, to say that we do not really rely on the courts of this land.</para><para>Senator Campbell was talking about approaches taken previously, the history of matters. I think it is fair enough to talk about the history, but in the end we have to make a decision in the light of the realities that exist at this time.

I thought his contribution was helpful in terms of both putting this matter into perspective and enabling the issue to be aired. The parliamentary secretary made the pointâand I said it was an important pointâthat we have to distinguish between relationship and conduct. Parliamentary secretary, in much of your rebuttal of the need for the amendment you did focus on relationship and how this amendment would put at risk the autonomy of legal entities and their ability to stand alone. However, I believe your focus should be on conduct not relationship. If you have a look at the government's own bill, it does focus very much on conduct. This amendment requires the court to establish whether conduct was such that it should take action. Not only would an employer have a considerable defence in these circumstances but of course within the court processâin contrast to black-letter law, prescriptive lawâthere is always the opportunity to appeal. And in the generation of the court process, case law will be developed.</para></talk.start><para>You did put the rhetorical question to the Senate, Parliamentary Secretary, as to how you would determine whether something was just. My understanding of Senator Cooney's points is that he clearly said that determining whether something is just is very much within the ambit of a court's understanding and daily practice. It is not as difficult as you may have implied. If you look closely at the amendment concerned, it states:</para><quote><para>When a company is being wound up in insolvency, the liquidator, a creditor of the company or the Commission may apply to the Court for an order that a company that is, or has been, a related body corporate pay to the liquidator the whole or part of the amount of a debt of the insolvent company.</para></quote><para>It is very precise because it then states:</para><quote><para>The Court may make such an order if it is satisfied that it is just to do so.</para></quote><para>Then in clause (2) there is a very wide set of considerations that the court should have regard to, none of which interfere with its absolute discretion in this matter.

The parliamentary secretary made the government's approach clear. He said that the government would not accept this amendmentâthat they would reject it in the House of Representativesâand that it would return to the Senate.

I always wonder why, when such statements are made, the government does not consider the alternative possibilityâthat is, to improve or make better those areas of an amendment that they regard as inappropriate. I make these points to you, through the chair, Parliamentary Secretary, because it is clear to me from the minister's statements, the explanatory memorandum and the bill that you condemn immoral conduct and that you are seeking to address it. This just adds to the ability to address immoral conduct by companies who avoid their obligations to creditors, particularly employees. In that sense, to dismiss this solely because you believe it attacks the independence and autonomy of legal entitiesâbecause you concentrate on the relationship aspectâI think does a disservice to the cause or the problem that you are trying to address.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To summarise, I agree with Senator Cooney that this is fuzzy rather than prescriptive law.

I do not think for one minute that it would put at risk the corporate structure and the normal daily conduct of corporations under the Corporations Law in our society. Therefore, having made such strong statements, Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure that you are not going to change your mind. But I would at least suggest to you and your advisers that, when this is being considered in the House of Representatives, you might consider the alternative remedy to rejectionâthat is, to improve this to meet any of the particular objections you may have, and then the Senate could consider that.

It is actually something that we have under close consideration. I certainly did not try to make this pointâthat we are not going to go ahead with thisâin a threatening way. I think it is fair to say that Senator Murray would know better than most that, in terms of previous amendments to the Corporations Law, we have accepted a number of amendments that he has moved, and they have gone into law. Sometimes we have not been entirely happy about those amendments and sometimes it has been a balancing act between what we regard as the negatives of some of the amendments and what we regard as the positives of the rest of the bill. But that is compromise, and that is unfortunately what life in the real world is often about, both outside and inside this place.</para></talk.start><para>We have looked at this option. We believe, and I will quickly reiterate, that the proposed offence in the government's bill extends beyond group companies and related parties. It can apply to any person who enters into an agreement or transaction for the purpose of avoiding or reducing the payment of employee entitlements. The amendment limits recovery to group companies or related parties and will most likely result in a gap. Transactions could be deliberately structured not to involve related parties. We believe it is seriously flawed. We have looked at the amendment closely, and we have had it before us for some weeks, as you know. CASAC, our advisory committee, are looking at it. We are not being dogmatic about this, but I do think it is fair that everybody involved understands the government's position on this, which is that we will not be accepting this amendment at any stage and that insistence on the amendment will obviously have the effect of this proposed legislation not becoming law. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>14333</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have one question for the parliamentary secretary.

It is not, as the parliamentary secretary is trying to portray, that the Labor Party has been tardy in the last few years in pursuing this issue. With the Democrats, we jointly successfully moved and passed the amendments in this very chamber. The parliamentary secretary himself stood upâand I was here that dayâand sought agreement from the Democrats and the Labor Party to withdraw the amendments because the Wallis bills were being held up because the House of Representatives was refusing to accept them. We made it clear that, even though we believed in these amendments and in the necessity of these amendments, we would cooperate with the offer that the parliamentary secretary made to the Democrats and to the opposition to conduct a hearing of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities.

After that, Senator Campbell, as I have raised with you previously, the election intervened. Following the election, I sought to re-move the terms of reference on the committee, as is required to re-establish an inquiry. I moved that at the committee, and to my dismay government members and senators broke the word of the government and the parliamentary secretary in moving that the terms of reference not be re-established. I have raised it with you once before in the chamber that this happened. You undertook to find out what had happened and to ensure that the members of the committee understood that it was not just a parliamentary secretary, Ian Campbell, off on his own personal frolic; it was a government commitment to hold the inquiry. Unfortunately, the Democrats at the timeâSenator Murray, as I am sure you rememberâdecided that it was not an appropriate time either.

Unfortunately, we are a little bit more suspicious of the government. Once those bills arrived, we found thatâsurprise, surpriseâthey did not cover the areas particularly relevant to Patrick. We were a little disappointed that the government members continued to block and defy your commitment and the government's commitment and would not allow us to hold the free-ranging inquiry that you had promised we would be able to hold. It was disappointing that that continued to be the position, and it was disappointing, Senator Murray, that at the time you took the position you did. But these are swings and roundabouts. We all have our wins and losses, and that was one of mine. I have had a few losses at the hands of the government and the Democrats.

He sought to draw yesterday's budget into this debate, so I feel I must respond on behalf of the opposition.

Senator Murray, I am sure you have had a chance to crunch the numbers, and you have picked up those rorts. I heard the Democrats ask a question on those very rorts today.

He said that it was `of course' a capital item. Those were Mr Smith's own words. But the government turned up yesterday with a bodgie classification, did not want to admit to a cost and got flushed out because they were under so much heat in the budget lockup. They lost control of the debate in the budget lockup. Is it any wonder they have copped a bath in the public today? They were forced to issue a clarifying memorandum. Do you know what time they gave it to us in the lockup, Senator Murray? I am sure you got it slightly ahead of us.

On your behalf, I will remonstrate with them that they treated you so shoddily in the lockup yesterday. But it indicated to us at the time, in the lockup, that this was an extraordinary developmentâthat the government were on the run in their own lockup. They could not get out of their own lockup fast enough. They had been caught with their hand in the cookie jar; they were trying to have their cake and eat it. Then, as Senator Sherry has already indicated, we had the case of the classification of a state grant as a loan. You may ask: how on earth could you classify a state grant as a loan? Let me tell you the story, Senator Murray. Again, the sorts of shonky practices that companies like Patrick have been involved in are highlighted by these shonky accounting practicesâand I know you care about accounting standards, Senator Murray, because you have supported me in a very important statement by this parliament about accounting standards. I know you supported me on that, and I know you have a deep and abiding interest. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Unfortunately, because the government did a deal with the Democrats on the GST on issues like the small, struggling business of the Packer familyâand, because of those amendments, the Democrats gave extra cash to the Packer familyâthe government got less revenue for the states. That was one of the outcomes. There were many others, but that was the highlight for meâthe struggling family business of the Packers getting a $10 million subsidy, courtesy of the Democrats. Under the new agreement, the government were required to maintain the revenue base of the states in the transitional period to the full flow-on from the GST revenue coming to them. That amounts to $2.6 billion coming to themâthat is $2.6 billion that the federal government have to give to the states to keep their commitment arising from a variety of changes. Did you notice that, in the budget papers, they very kindly set your amendments aside? They have even described, in a budget document, `the Democrat amendments'. Wasn't that good of them? I am sure you welcome that. You are able to walk around saying, `Look, we did this.' Most others think they were just trying to drop you in it with the financial markets, but I think they were doing you the favour of giving you a bit of extra publicity, Senator Murray. I think that was their motive. I think they were very kind to you when they did that.</para><para>But I will go back to the point of the discussion: what we saw was the $2.6 billion broken into two separate transactions. An amount of $1 billion was accurately described as a grant because, when you describe something as a grant, you have to put it in the budget papers. What happened to the other $1.6 billion? It was not included in the budget papers; it is actually described elsewhere in budget documents as a loan. If you describe it as a loan to the states, it does not have to be included as a grant, a revenue or an expenditure. You might ask: what is wrong with the fact that they had chosen to pull this sort of dodgy rort a la Patrick and the fact that they had got away with classifying a state grant as a loan? We actually have a couple of states where we are in government so we have been able to check this out. We have phoned them and asked, `Could you tell us the terms of this loan?' The states have fessed up.

The third of the rorts, which I may come back to as time does not permit me to cover it right now, involves the Reserve Bank again.

The first point that needs to be made is that promised inquiryâI understand that promise was made by Senator Ian Campbellâwas in fact delivered. The Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities initiated an inquiry into the issue of employee entitlements in the middle of 1999. </para></talk.start><para>Following that inquiry being initiated, we became aware as a committee that the government intended to legislate in this field. Therefore, the committee agreed to defer that inquiry pending the provision of that legislation. I have to say that decision to defer the inquiry was agreed to by Senator Murray, and it was also agreed to by a member of staff in Senator Conroy's office. Although Senator Conroy himself was overseas at the time, the matter was raised with his office and his office agreed to accept the deferral of that inquiry pending the legislation. Subsequently, the committee prepared an issues paper on the matter of employee entitlements based on the submissions which we had received. Having already advertised for submissions with regard to our pending inquiry, we prepared an issues paper based on those submissions, and that issues paper was provided to Ministers Reith and Hockey to assist them in the preparation of the legislation. So that is the chain of events in terms of the inquiry.</para><para>When the <inline ref="R992">Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000</inline> came forward this year, we proceeded with our inquiry into that legislation. Senator Conroy has said that the terms of reference for that inquiry were not adequate. In actual fact, the terms of reference under which that inquiry was conducted were the exact terms of reference that were initiated by Senator O'Brien in this chamber in referring the bill to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry. I had actually drafted terms of reference to initiate an inquiry into the legislation on the part of the committee but, overlapping that, the Senate itself referred the matter to the committee. In the final wash-up, the terms of reference that applied were the terms of reference as moved by Senator O'Brien and determined by the Senate chamber. Senator Conroy has absolutely no grounds for complaint with regard to whether or not the inquiry was adequate and in particular whether or not the terms of reference were adequate, because they were the terms of reference that came from his side of the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>14336</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must respond to Senator Chapman's very, very misleading response. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator Chapman</name></talker><para>âThey are the facts. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âThe facts are that I moved after the election for the re-establishment of the inquiry and that before the election we had gone as far as setting a hearing date and drawing up a witness list, as you well know.

What has come to light in the last 48 hours is that the Reserve Bank have held back nearly $700 million of dividend for the purposes of giving it to the government in the next financial year. So if you take the $1.6 billion rort of misclassified expenditureâthat is, misclassifying a loan so that it does not look like a grantâadd the near $700 million of Reserve Bank dividend that should be rightfully classified as receipts in this financial year but you are rorting the system and having it delivered next financial year, and then take out the asset sales money, which Greg Smith from the Treasury defined as a capital asset just last week, you actually find that this government is shonkily trying to pretend it is running a surplus when in actual fact it is running a $2 billion deficit.

I was just making the point that the sort of corporate shenanigans that this amendment is trying to catch include trying to mislead shareholders and mislead workers with accounting shonkiness, which this government has displayed in the last 48 hours. If this government were forced to adhere to the same standards which now will be delivered by this bill for the protection of workers, ASIC would have been knocking on the Treasurer's door last night seeking an explanation for the sorts of outrageous misrepresentations and corporate accounting shenanigans that we have seen in the Patrick case. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Do not let the Patrick case be forgotten. Time is a great healer. But those who were involved and who went down to the docksâand I know, Senator Cooney, you were down at the docks, and I visited the docks on occasionâwould know of the sort of shenanigans that we are trying to stop with this bill: the dogs on chains, the balaclavas, the un-Australian acts, this government being in the dock on conspiracy to breach its own laws. That is the sort of behaviour which this amendment seeks to stamp outâhow this government was complicit in having ordinary Australians sacked simply because they were members of an union. The Prime Minister even admitted that every single union member had to be sacked. It did not matter whether they were involved in an industrial dispute with Patrick or not. It did not matter whether there were world-leading productivity issues at stake. It did not matter that the company had not put any money into upgrading its machinery and equipment and, therefore, that you could not achieve world productivity standards. It made no difference. The Prime Minister said, `Every unionist has got to go'âclearly in breach of his own laws.</para><para>So this amendment is designed to catch the sorts of shenanigans of Patrick, the sort of corporate spivery of Scanlan and CorriganâLiberal Party mates in Victoria who have been in it up to their necks in a whole range of corporate scamsâand the sorts of scams that this government has been caught red-handed with yesterday on the budget. This amendment deserves the support of this chamber. This amendment deserves the support of the government. I welcome Senator Murray's support, and I hope that we can conclude this debate reasonably soon.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>14339</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âApropos of what Senator Campbell has said and as Senator Conroy has said about Senator Campbell, I wish to say that Senator Campbell is a person who does look at these matters fully and with consideration. He said that, nevertheless, the government would not be looking at the amendments put forward by the opposition. Of the amendments put forward by the opposition, this particular one, proposed section 588YA, attempts to make a company responsible for money that is owed by another company to which it is related, in a way that is fair and just. Senator Campbell was concerned that this would hit at the heart of the concept behind corporations.</para></talk.start><para>Perhaps I might say for a start that corporations are very much the subject of legislation of the parliament. I think that originally we may have had some charter from the king. But, fundamentally, corporations are creations of statute. In that sense, parliament can make them, and break them for that matterânot that it would ever want to break them. But certainly parliament would want to restrain them, and that is proper for parliament to do since companies are the creature of the legislative process.</para><para>The proposed government amendments show just how serious it is about these matters. Proposed section 596ABâentering into agreements or transactions to avoid employee entitlementsâsays:</para><quote><para>(1)	A person must not enter into a relevant agreement or a transaction with the intention of, or with intentions that include the intention of:</para><para>(a) preventing the recovery of the entitlements of employees of a company; or</para><para>(b) significantly reducing the amount of the entitlements of employees of a company that can be recovered.</para></quote><para>So this is proposing that people should not go about planning things in such a way that anybody who is owed money by companiesâand we having been talking about employees hereâshould be denied what is rightfully theirs by some person, or a group of persons, entering into agreements and transactions to ensure that those creditors and those employees in particular do not get what is duly theirs. The penalty proposed for people who commit that offence is, according to schedule 3 of the bill, 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both. That is a very heavy penalty and shows the significance that is placed on this by the government. Subsection 2 of proposed section 596AB states that this applies: </para><quote><para>... even if:</para><para>(a) the company is not a party to the agreement or transaction; or</para><para>(b) the agreement or transaction is approved by a court.</para></quote><para>The scheme is that anybody who enters into an agreement or transaction that will deny a worker his or her entitlements, his or her wages, or indeed any creditor of the company that enters into an agreement to deny them their true entitlements, will be punished, even if that agreement was sanctioned by a court and even though the company is not a party to the agreement. It would be sanctioned, of course, by the court without the court knowing the intention that lay behind it. There are a couple of concepts behind this proposalâone being that parliament ought to step in and make sure that the people who act in the way that is dealt with under this section ought to be punished for denying people their rights and another being that people ought to be punished, even though the company was not party to the agreement, or the company was not involved, as it were, with that agreement. So there is this concept of having persons outside the company made responsible in a very solid way for what the company does.</para><para>That concept lies behind the proposal of the opposition to introduce a law that makes related companies responsible for the debts of a company that denies its workers their entitlements. The opposition's proposal requires that the two companiesâthe company that has the debt and the related companyâhave joined, as it were, in an enterprise that results in this difficulty, or that in some way has a relationship to it because subsection 4 of this opposition amendment says:</para><quote><para>An order shall not be made under this section if the only ground for making the order is that creditors of the company have relied on the fact that another company is or has been a related body corporate of the company.</para></quote><para>So it has to be more than just a related company. It has to be a related company that in some way has helped the company owing the worker his or her wages, has in some way done work, carried out transactions, entered into agreements or done something with that debtor company that has led to that debt. That idea of one company being liable for another company's debts has precedent, and I refer to section 588B of the Corporations Act, which sets out when a holding company is liable for the company that it is the holding company to and so on.</para><para>So I would invite the parliamentary secretary and the government to consider proposed section 588YA going into the Corporations Law. As I say, it comes from a long tradition of one company being responsible for another. It comes from a long tradition of parliament regulating companies in the interests of the creditors. It comes from a long tradition of parliament trying to balance the good that comes from allowing corporations, allowing people who are members of the corporations, to take actions and to develop innovative products and services without the fear that they might go broke doing so and measuring that against the fact that companies that have their liability limited in some way can also inflict terrible damage on those to whom they owe money. I put it to you that this is a very sensible proposal put forward by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>14340</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will really try not to delay this, but Senator Cooney said that we were not going to consider it.

Currently, only ASIC or the corporation can apply for a compensation order. This amendment will assist employees where ASIC has proven the contravention of a civil penalty order. In that case, a creditor can apply to the court for a compensation order if the corporation has suffered damage. It will allow employees to take an active role in recovering their entitlements where a civil penalty provision has been proven to have been contravened. Employees want that role. They want to know that their employee entitlements are safe or, if they are lost due to the unscrupulous actions of a director, that they can be recovered. Employees do not at the moment have that security. They deserve that security. This amendment will mean that the risk that the assets of a corporation will be diminished by the actions of unscrupulous directors is reduced. It will maximise the amount of assets which, in the event of insolvency, are available to be distributed to employees. It will enhance the opportunity of employees to recover, to protect their employee entitlements. This bill is an inadequate response to the issue of employee entitlements. More needs to be done.

There are a couple of reasons we do not support the amendment, and we have conveyed these to the Labor Party. We are concerned with the possibility of the company and several creditors bringing separate actions based on the same circumstances. That would create problems with any of the parties negotiating settlement of an action if a full discharge could not be given to a dependant. Furthermore, the company could expend unnecessary resources defending multiple actions by creditors based on the same circumstances.

If you look at the sweep of history, starting off in the Middle Ages when the church was a very powerful organisation, all sorts of institutions, and people within them, grew up at that time who wanted, as it were, to modify its power. And then, when the monarchy was very powerful, all sorts of institutions grew upâparliament itself grew up at that timeâin an attempt to modify the power of the dominating institution. Of course, parliament itself became very dominant in the 18th century in England, and there had to be all sorts of reforms brought in then. I think the dominating force in modern days is the corporation itself. If you think about the vast wealth that corporations possessâlike the church and the monarchy once didâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âAnd the shareholders.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âAnd the shareholders, as Senator Campbell says, and that is true, but the vast wealth is not controlled by the shareholders; it is controlled by the board and the chief executive officer. It is just like the kings: they were not the only people in the various countriesâEngland is the one that we are most familiar withâbut, nevertheless, the monarchy was in control. Senator Campbell is quite right: companies do not consist simply of the board, the chief executive officers and the managers; they consist of shareholders. But the shareholders are powerless. They have their annual general meeting, but there is not much they can do there, as experience would show. They can do some things, but they do not have the power that the board and the chief executive officer have of some of these companies, which are quite vast and upon which our modern world depends. The creation of wealth comes largely through companies. People's lives are very much affected by decisions of boardsâthis is a point that has been made again and againâwhether they are overseas or here. Look at the situation in South Australia with Mitsubishi: if they went, that could cause great trouble for South Australia. Look at the issue of the Rover corporation in England now: if they go, and if they are not held up by some foreign company, that could have all sorts of results for workers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is, I think, an argument to say that people who are affected by these corporations ought to have an ability to move against them in their own interests, just as a citizen is entitled to move against a state to preserve his or her rights. If a person is wrongly taxed, they can go to the AATâthe Administrative Appeals Tribunalâor somewhere else. If the state refuses to pay sufficient social security, a person can sue the Commonwealth in respect of that. If a person has an accident on the roadâat least in some statesâthey can sue the government.

When the government finalises the arrangements in relation to the compensatory scheme, I hope that that review will result in additional measures on the preventative side of the equation rather than only focusing on the compensation issue.

I know that it is an important issue.</para><para>The great thing, as Senator Murray has alluded to, is that soundly based, successful organisations and corporations in this eraâif it has been ever been any differentâknow that to be successful they need motivated, loyal, dedicated employees: they are the true capital, particularly in the modern information economy, of a corporation. The sort of employers that you are talking to are usually the successful employers, and the government believes very strongly in that sort of ethos.

So we regard this as an unnecessary amendment.</para><para>I give Senator Murray and the Senate the undertaking that this area will be kept under review. We have an open mind on these things.

We do have the CASAC report coming forward on corporate groups, and of course the government will receive that and it will be a public document. We will look at what they recommend.</para><para>I take the opportunityâand Senator Murray would think less of me if I did notâto encourage him to keep an equally open mind and to look at all of the issues and all of the submissions in relation to the very important area of reform of the law to empower shareholders and corporationsâthat is, takeovers reform and the follow-on ruleâand have an equally open mind and give thorough consideration to the significant merits of that significant piece of reform, which he has given us an undertaking that he will look at closely. I look forward very much to that joint parliamentary committee report, and particularly to Senator Murray's own comments on the proposition that they have before them. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>14345</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek an indication from the government as to whether it intends to divide.

The first body that ought to be prosecuted under this particular piece of legislation is the government. If anyone is guilty of deceiving or misrepresenting or misleading the Australian public with respect to the GST it is the government, and they have spent substantial amounts of money doing so. We know that they have spent at least $360 million-odd, identified after some very good questioning through the estimates process. I think it grew from somewhere around $25 million in the morning to $361 million in the afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>This particular amendment to the Trade Practices Act in some ways goes across section<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>52 of the same act, because that particular section prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which misleads or deceives or is likely to mislead or deceive. According to Professor Warren Pengilley<inline font-weight="bold">,</inline> who is a professor at the University of Newcastle, section 52 is worded in general terms and incurs no criminal penalties. The section is enforced by the sanctions of damages, injunction or wide-ranging `other orders', including corrective advertising, which can be made under the Trade Practices Act. Last year a new part VB, sections 75AT to 75AZ, was inserted in the TPA, which prohibited price exploitation by corporations during the new tax system changes and also empowered the ACCC to monitor prices from 1 July 1999 to 1 July 2002. I suppose we could call this bill the 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent bill, with respect to which, frankly, the Labor Party has been able to uncover one of the great misleading factors of the approach of this government in the introduction of the GST. We know that the government has not issued a directive to the ACCC to prosecute particular traders should their price exceed 10 per cent as a result of the effect of the GST; that is clearly the case.</para><para>The legislation also introduced the price exploitation code but, because the Commonwealth's power is limited in this respect, all jurisdictions, with the exception of Queensland, have agreed to implement this new code so the ACCC can have the same functions as above with respect to persons rather than corporations. The explanatory memorandum states that the intent of the legislation is to: </para><quote><para>... prevent the possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking in the transition to the New Tax System.</para></quote><para>Part of section <inline font-weight="bold">75AYA</inline> asks the ACCC to police the clause:</para><quote><para>A person must not, in trade or commerce ... engage in conduct ... that falsely represents the effect, or likely effect, of all or any of the New Tax System changes.</para></quote><para>When we look at that, we have got to look at what the ACCC has said, and we also have to look at what the government said. Back in January of this year the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Joe Hockey, made an announcement about this. He said:</para><quote><para>No prices will increase by more than 10% as a result of the GSTâthat is our policy and that is the law.</para><para>Any rounding that increases prices beyond the GST of 10% is unacceptable. And companies that try to profit from the introduction of the GST will face fines of up to $10 million.</para></quote><para>He further said in the statement:</para><quote><para>Mr Hockey reaffirmed that if prices increase, as a result of the GST, it must be by 10% or less and many prices will come down as wholesale sales tax and other taxes are abolished on 1 July.</para></quote><para>You would have thought that with such a statement the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation would have written off to the ACCC, which is going to be the watchdog body responsible for ensuring that his statements, the government's policy, is implemented, is followed. But no, he did not do that. We look also at what has happened in respect of the ACCC. The ACCC has said that 10 per cent is 10 per cent. With the greatest of respect to Professor Fels, he did make the comment that 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent. They have issued price guidelines that say something slightly different. The price guidelines say:</para><quote><para>... no price should rise by more than 10 per cent because of the New Tax System changes ...</para></quote><para>In the supplementary additional estimates on 1 May, when the ACCC appeared before the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Conroy questioned Mr Jepsen of the ACCC about this issue of whether or not the government has actually directed the ACCC in writingâthat is, to make it lawâthat no price will go up by more than 10 per cent. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> read:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONROY</inline>âSo you have not received a mandate from the government to determine what those effects are?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jepsen</inline>âI have not, no.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONROY</inline>âThere is nothing in the legislation, Professor Fels, that says the ACCC will determine what the effects or likely effects of the changes are?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Prof. Fels</inline>âI think I understand the question and, if so, I do not think we have had that from the governmentâif I understand your question.</para></quote><para>Further:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator CONROY</inline>âMr Hockey has been quotedâand I think everyone saw it at the timeâin January or Februaryâas saying that he has directed you that no price is to increase by more than 10 per cent.

Unfortunately, the poor ACCC is under significant pressure from the government to conduct this scare campaign on business, to actually silence business in terms of the criticism and make sure that, if possible, they do keep their prices as a result of the effect of the GST within 10 per cent when in reality we know that in many instances that is not going to be the case. It is simply not going to happen. As a result of that, the government has embarked upon this campaign of changing the law, putting in huge penalties for the same thing, which is very interesting. The current legislation has penalties that are much lower. I have got to sayâjust as a side issueâthat in respect of deceit and misleading and misrepresenting there are enough corporations out there now doing it. We have not got the ACCC prosecuting too many of those, and that is a matter I am going to take up with the ACCC in respect of some investment schemes about the place at the moment. I am going to ask them why those things are not being prosecuted under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. </para><para>I come back to `10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent'. As I said, the ACCC are being put in the very invidious position of having to run the government's argument for it. We have had Minister Hockey making statements that no price shall rise more than 10 per cent when in fact we know that that is simply not going to be the case. The ACCC have to look at these matters on a case-by-case basis. Professor Fels has said that. They can do nothing other than that. The realityâdespite the ACCC having been put in a corner of having to say that they cannot envisage a circumstance where the price will increase as a result of the net effect of the cost of the introduction of the GSTâis that the ACCC will not say they will prosecute a business if there is a case where that business can legitimately demonstrate that the costs of the introduction of the new tax system to them have caused them to put up their price by more than 10 per cent. Because they will not. They simply cannot under the law. And that is where this government is clearly misleading the people. That is the reality. Minister Joe Hockey's statement back in January was just a load of rubbish.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âRear end of the horse.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âYes, if anyone should be prosecuted, the first cab off the rank should be the government or at least Minister Hockey for making misleading statements. There is another aspect about the guidelines that the ACCC have come out with. Of course the ACCC have a big job. It will be very interesting to see how they manage given the number of complaints that they get. We were given various figures, but they receive around 1,000 calls a week. They indicated during the estimates process that they were able to cope with thatâthat they could swing more staff into actionâbut there are concerns when you look at the national complexity of retail prices and the number of potential outlets that could put prices up, as has already occurred. The ACCC have therefore already had cause to take action in certain areas on this. But when this becomes a full-blown issue after 1 July, one just cannot imagine how the ACCC are going to have the capacityâand I have the greatest respect for themâto deal with all of these issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is abundantly clear that the ACCC are not going to have the resources to deal with this and there are going to be a lot of dissatisfied people out there. This is as a result of this government not being able to get this thing right in the first place. As I said, this government are embarking upon this campaign whereby they are just trying to scare business. There is no legitimacy whatsoever to this or, if there isâand note that the government are going to make it a $10 million fine for a corporation and $500,000 fine for an individualâI suppose you could say that the government know that people are going to try to rip other people off. That is what those fines have to indicate. You are talking about making the fines so high for this sort of practice that you must have some view that there is going to be profit-taking on this.</para><para>To go back to the number of complaints that the ACCC receives, it is quoted in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 24 March that since last July the ACCC has received more than 7,500 complaints and inquiries, and the number is growing. A Dr Cousins is quoted in that article as saying that `last week the ACCC received about 1,000 calls'. I think that is an indication of the concernâand this is before the ball has even bounced on this thing. When we get to 1 July and thereafter, as I said, taking the number of the retail outlets around this country and the callsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âI hope that they have a new switchboard.

I think all of the telecommunication service providers can expect an increase in business after 1 July, especially on the complaints line. They could well find that they could do a bit of profit-taking themselves. As I said, the 10 per cent is 10 per cent is simply not stacking up. It is wrong for the government to try to force the ACCC into a position of having to defend a policy that is not true. That is the case, because it is simply not true that prices will not go up by more than 10 per cent. Trying to restrict the costs of some businessesâthat is, as to what they can include in their costsâis a deliberate attempt to do that because many of these businesses will have to get new equipment that they would not have needed without this tax system change. Yet the indication from the ACCC and the government as to what can and cannot be included in such costs is clearly inadequate. As has been pointed out, it will be difficult for a lot of businesses. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>14348</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Lightfoot)</inline>âOrder!

His service is longer than that of any other National Party or Country Party senator from New South Wales. The next longest service was that of the late Colin McKellar, who served 12 years. David served longer than his immediate predecessor, Doug Scott, who retired in 1984 after 11 years. After former Senators Cooper, Drake Brockman, Webster and our current leader, Ron Boswell, David is the fifth longest serving National Party or Country Party senator in our 80th year as a federal party.</para></talk.start><para>David Gordon Cadell Brownhillâand I mention all his names because he is justifiably proud of his heritageâcame into the Senate as a well-regarded and innovative farmer. He brought the skills honed in his previous profession to this place. He was extremely hardworking, almost tireless in his areas of responsibility, and he showed a level of application necessary for all successful people. He came to and left this place with a close, interesting and successful family. The Arnotts, the family of his wife, Julia, also have a tradition of community service. David's late father-in-law, K.M.H. Arnott, won a DSO in New Guinea. As a junior officer, this was an award that did not merely come up with the rations. David came here having been chair of the New South Wales National Party, and he had wide political experience and understanding of the problems facing regional Australia. He served on a whole range of committees while the coalition was in opposition, including the rural and regional affairs committee, in which he played a leading role in inquiries dear to his heart like the one into animal welfare. He is justifiably regarded as a great committee man, having served on more than 90 parliamentary inquiries.</para><para>He has always said that the highlight of his career was his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the first Howard-Fischer government. He had a particular sympathy with and regard for the primary industry portfolio, where he was responsible for horticulture, wine and some aspects of quarantine, among other things. Funding for research and development in horticulture increased significantly during his term. He is somebody who makes plans for the future, and he always believed that research and development must remain a high priority if producers in this country are to remain competitive. The wine industry continued its strong export growth during his time, and he remains very interested in the product, probably both on a personal consumption level of some good quality reds and also in its continuing export growth. David was the principal parliamentary organiser of the National Rural Summit and then went on to chair the activating committee that prepared a report from the 140-odd recommendations. That report played a key role in the development of the $500 million Agriculture Advancing Australia package that received a $300 million boost in last night's budget. </para><para>This package provided many things for agriculture, but first among equals must be the change to risk management provided by the farm management deposits, encouraging farmers to plan for economic and seasonal downturn by a tax-deductible and market driven alternative. David was a member of the organising committee for the Regional Australia Summit held last year. Last night's budget showed the delivery of some of the summit's work for regional Australia. This includes the health package, which expands medical training facilities to increase the opportunities for medical students to train in rural service delivery. It adds 85 new regional health services, provides support for small community hospitals and aged care facilities, and improves access to specialists for country people. It encourages medical graduates to commit to rural practice, and it also increases assistance to isolated children, relaxes the assets test and reduces country fuel prices. Along with the massive tax cuts from 1 July, there is a very genuine attempt by the government flowing from the Regional Australia Summit to maintain the infrastructure and opportunities of country areas. David played an important part in that. He always acknowledged that there were no easy answers and that there is no cavalry about to ride over the hill but that there is a bright future for regional Australia if there is the right leadership, particularly local leadership, in cooperation with the government.</para><para>I am sure all senators on both sides of the chamber would agree that David Brownhill was honest and straightforward in his dealings with people and issues. He laboured hard with his conscience, particularly over the euthanasia and republic debates. He was true to himself in both of these. He served Australia well overseas. He led a number of parliamentary and trade delegations, and he presented a good and decent face for Australia. I think the distinguishing aspect of David's parliamentary career is that he was a team player, not the sort to let his side down. Right through from the debilitating Joh for Canberra campaign until he was a parliamentary secretary for trade and primary industries, he was given responsibility for government initiatives and applied himself accordingly.</para><para>To conclude, I wish him and his wife, Julia, well, and I am sure that his skills can be further used. I would like to thank him for retiring now, allowing me to return to the Senate after a break of 10 months. Few people have a chance to be in the parliament. I have been given a second chance. I particularly thank my party and my colleagues, both National and Liberal. I feel privileged to have a second opportunity to make a contribution to constructive debate in this country, and I will not waste any time in doing so.

I would like to talk about the issue of so-called honour killings in Pakistan. I am most concerned about reports that Pakistani women have been murdered for things such as divorcing, reporting a rape or marrying against the wishes of their parents. I have received many letters from concerned Australians who are asking the Australian government to take action on this. Amnesty International is running a campaign highlighting the silent plight of all these women. I thank Amnesty for bringing this to my attention, and I would like to talk tonight about its campaign. If anybody wants more details, they can of course find them on the Amnesty web site.</para></talk.start><para>Many Pakistani women are subjected to extreme control by their male relatives, who claim ownership, sometimes with amazing brutality. Although generally these women put up with this treatment, slowly there is a growing awareness of women's rights. Although it helps the women to realise that they do not have to put up with the treatment, when they do stand up to it the retaliation can be swift and brutal. In fact, the curve of honour killings has risen parallel to the rise in awareness of rights. </para><para>It is amazing to me, living as I do in the relative freedom of Australian society, that every year hundreds of women are known to die as a result of so-called honour killings in Pakistan. Many more cases go unreported, and almost all go unpunished. Even when these women are brave enough to do something about it, they find they live in a nation state which is indifferent toâand even complicit inâtheir plight. Police almost invariably take the man's side in these domestic murders and rarely prosecute the murderers. Even when the men are convicted, the judiciary usually ensures that they receive a light sentence, reinforcing the view that men can kill their female relatives with virtual impunity. Specific laws hamper redress as they discriminate against women.</para><para>There are also few women's shelters, and travelling alone for women is dangerous as they are a target for abuse by police, by strangers or by male relatives hunting for them. Sadly, some feel that the only way out is suicide. Amnesty makes the point that abuses such as honour killings are crimes under Pakistan's criminal laws. However, systematic failure by the state to prevent them or to investigate them and punish the perpetrators leads to international irresponsibility by that state. The government of Pakistan has taken no measures to end honour killings or to hold perpetrators to account. It has failed to train police and judges to be gender neutral and to amend discriminatory laws. It has ignored article 5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which it ratified in 1996, which obliges states to `modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women' to eliminate prejudice and discriminatory traditionsâI love that word, `traditions'. Even where the claim is made, almost unbelievably, that it is a genuine traditional custom to murder a female relative, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action stated:</para><quote><para>All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. </para></quote><para>It also asserted that the duty of states is:</para><quote><para>... to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.</para></quote><para>The United Nations General Assembly in 1993 adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which urges states not to `invoke custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation' to eliminate discriminatory treatment of women. Often these murders are carried out on the flimsiest of grounds, such as by a man who said that he had dreamt his wife had betrayed him and, therefore, he had to kill her. State institutions deal with these crimes against women with extraordinary leniency, and the law provides many loopholes for murderers, in the name of `honour', to kill without punishment. As a result, this so-called tradition remains unbroken.</para><para>The methods of killing are also most brutal. In Sindh they may be hacked to pieces by axes or hatchets, often with the complicity of the community. In Punjab the killings, usually by shooting, are more often based on individual decisions and carried out in private. In most cases husbands, fathers or brothers of the women concerned commit the killings. In some cases tribal councils, or jirgas, decide that the women should be killed, and they send men to carry it out. Nobody is exempt from being killed, and age does not bring safety. The victims range from prepubescent girls to grandmothers. It is also amazing to hear that the killings occur outside Pakistan as well. The Nottingham Crown Court in the UK in May 1999 sentenced a Pakistani woman and her grown-up son to life imprisonment for murdering the woman's daughter, Rukhsana Naz, a pregnant mother of two children. Rukhsana was perceived to have brought shame on the family by having a sexual relationship outside marriage. Her brother reportedly strangled Rukhsana while her mother held her down. </para><para>Two main factors contribute to violence against women here: women's commodification and concepts of honour. The concept of women as commodities, not as human beings endowed with dignity and rights equal to those of men, is deeply rooted in tribal culture. Ownership rights are at stake when women are to be marriedâalmost always in Pakistan by their parents. A major consideration is the property or assets that the young woman has the right to inherit one day. A woman is handed over to her spouse against payment of a bride price to her father. Sometimes that bride price includes another woman given to her father as a new wife. Some men accept a low bride price on the condition that the as yet unborn daughter of the couple will be returned to them to be married off for another bride price. The commodification of women is also the basis of the tradition of khoon baha,<inline font-style="italic"></inline>or blood money, when a woman is handed over to an adversary to settle a conflict. Women are seen to embody the honour of the men to whom they `belong'. As such, they must guard their virginity and their chastity. By being perceived to enter an `illicit' sexual relationship, a woman defiles the honour of her guardian and his family. In most communities there is no punishment for the transgressor besides death. A man's ability to protect his honour is judged by his family and his neighbours. He must publicly demonstrate his power to safeguard his honour by killing those who damaged it and thereby restore it. Honour killingsâmurders, reallyâare consequently often performed quite openly.</para><para>The perception of what defiles honour has become very loose. Male control extends not just to a woman's body and her sexual behaviour but to all of her behaviour, including her movements and her language. In any of these areas, defiance by women translates into undermining male honour. Severe punishments are reported for bringing food late, for answering back or for undertaking forbidden family visits. A man's honour, defiled by a woman's alleged or real sexual misdemeanour or other defiance, is only partly restored by murdering her. He also has to kill the man allegedly involved. Since a woman is murdered first, the man often hears about it and flees. The frequency of killings and the unexpectedness with which women are targeted not surprisingly contributes to an atmosphere of fear among young women. The poet Attiya Dawood quoted a pubescent girl in a small Sindhi village:</para><quote><para>My brother's eyes forever follow me. My father's gaze guards me all the time, stern, angry ... We stand accused and condemned to be declared kari and murdered.</para></quote><para>Women can be killed for many reasons: it may be for expressing a desire to choose a spouse or it may be for marrying a partner of one's choice. Frequently, fathers bring charges of zina, or unlawful sexual relations, against daughters who have married men of their choice, alleging that they are not validly married. But, even when such complaints are before the courts, some men still resort to private justice. Often women choosing a spouse are abducted and are never heard of again. Women who have sought divorce through the courts have been attacked, injured or killed. Seeking divorce is seen as an act of public defiance which calls for punitive action to restore male honour. Even more horrific is that they may be killed if they are raped. The victims of a violent crime are seen to be the perpetrators and the ones who have to be murdered. Amnesty outlines some horrific stories. I will not go into them. They are just too horrible to go into.</para><para>Amazingly, there are even fake honour killings. Where the woman is killed and the man escapes, as is often the case, the man has to compensate the affected manâthe husband or the other male relativeâfor the damage to honour he inflicted, for the worth of the woman who was killed and to have his own life spared. This scheme provides many opportunities to make money, to obtain a woman in compensation or to conceal other crimes, in the near certainty that honour killingsâif they come to courtâwill be dealt with leniently. There is an honour killing industry involving tribespeople, police and tribal mediators. Time does not permit me to go into any more detail on this practice, but the concern that I share with Amnesty is the Pakistan state's abrogation of their responsibilities. I urge everybody to have a look at the Amnesty web site and I urge the government to make much more public their abhorrence of this dreadful practice. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Zimbabwe</title><page.no>14352</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>14352</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âZimbabwe is in political and economic crisis and the situation is deteriorating. That matters to Australia because of the ties that many Australians have with friends and relatives in Zimbabwe, and because Australia's commercial interests in Zimbabwe are threatened. It also matters because if Zimbabwe is added to the world's `basket cases', it is just one more burden on the international community of which Australia is a strong part. </para></talk.start><para>It is widely reported that Zimbabwe has up to one-quarter of its adult population afflicted with AIDS, inflation at 60 per cent, unemployment of 50 per cent, a contracting economy and a budget deficit estimated at 15 per cent of GDP and is desperately short of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe is conducting a foreign adventure in the Congo at a reputed cost of $30 million per month. The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Community and the Commonwealth condemn its government's reckless descent into tyranny. Zimbabwe's neighbours are deeply concerned, and that great statesman Nelson Mandela has made strong statements condemning the violence and intimidation. </para><para>The rule of law, which was badly undermined in Ian Smith's time with detention without trial, has much deteriorated under President Mugabe. He personally, and his government, refused to enforce the High Court's rulings requiring the eviction of squatters on commercial farms, and the police refuse to protect those farmers, farm workers and Zimbabweans in danger as well as those who are opposed to the government. There is little respect for the freedoms of association or of expression. The police and military are not impartial and are reputedly led by members of ZANU-PF, the ruling party. Organised murder, rape, mass beatings and thuggery are increasingly common in this country. Only some of the judiciary, a number of organisations and the very brave opposition, which is not in parliament, stand in defiance. </para><para>A badly designed constitution, bequeathed by the inept British, means there are few constraints on power and little accountability. According to Transparency International, Zimbabwe has a Corruption Perceptions Index ranking of 4.1, when 10 is perfect, as in Denmark. It was Robert Mugabe's defeat at the constitutional referendum earlier this year that brought on the latest crisis. The consequent assault on farmers and farm workers is targeted primarily at opponents of the government who are known supporters of MDC, the Movement for Democratic Change. The ZANU-PF fear the loss of power. They have disguised their political objective of crushing opposition by using a genuine and longstanding issue of land redistribution as a populist issue. However, Mr Mugabe's objectives are concerned with politics and power, not land and justice. Everyone understands that, his own party included. </para><para>Land redistribution has been an issue for decades, but it has already occurred on a large scale. Since independence in 1980 there has been a redistribution program affecting nearly four million hectares and hundreds of commercial farms. That land redistribution has largely been from a few hundred white Zimbabweans to a few hundred black Zimbabweans, but there has also been some wider reallocation of land to about 90,000 subsistence farmers. Zimbabwe at the turn of the last century had a population of about 400,000 people; it now has over 12 million people. There is no social security system and dryland subsistence agriculture is essential for much of the population. There has been a need for a redistribution of land but, of the hundreds of farms already taken overâmostly on a compensation basisâmost have so far gone to ruling members of ZANU-PF. For instance, a former general of the liberation army is reported to own 16 farmsâI doubt any of those have a squatter problem. </para><para>At present Zimbabwe's commercial farms allow it to feed itself and to generate very large sums of vital foreign exchange through significant exports. Based on experience to date, many of those farms that go into the hands of ZANU-PF leaders, who are not experienced commercial farmers by and large, end up being very much less productive. If they go into the hands of subsistence peasant farmers commercial production falls drastically. If existing commercial farmers leave the land Zimbabwe will lose the ability to feed itself and to earn much of its foreign exchange.  </para><para>Certainly population pressures mean that such landâwhich is underutilised on large land holdingsâshould be made available for redistribution. International law and plain morality mean that this should be done in an orderly and just fashion, and compensation should be paid. Commercial farms which are productive and which already support hundreds of thousands of farm workers and their families should remain in productive hands. Those farms support a large health, education and commercial infrastructure of their own and are reported to have two million people dependent on them. At present, those productive hands happen to be white Zimbabwean commercial farmersâmost of them citizensâbut, frankly, it is maintaining the productive capacity which is vital. </para><para>The squatters and political thugs that Mr Mugabe supports as veterans will condemn Zimbabwe to decades of poverty and economic troubles if their actions and murders result in commercial farmers being driven off the land. That so many of them are too young to be veterans has been obvious. Even the spokesperson of the veterans is reputed not to have war service; instead he has been an overseas representative for ZANU-PF. </para><para>Zimbabwean land rights issues are complex. There is the profoundly unfair, historical and race based colonial context. Zimbabwean blacks were precluded from individual ownership of productive farming land. Secondly, although dryland farming does require large acreages, many farms had underutilised land on them. Thirdly, land redistribution since independence in 1980 has not satisfied land hunger at all, since it has largely benefited elite members of the ZANU-PF party rather than black Zimbabweans living in crowded communal lands in the country.</para><para>In a country with a very large population of poor and unemployed people, naturally a covetous eye will always be cast on those who are better off, whether black or white. That is not a justification for organised murder, beatings, rape and theft. Communally owned land is not as productive or as efficient as commercially managed land. Simply put, Zimbabwe has to retain the expertise and ability to produce food and exports. That ability resides in about 4,500 commercial farmers, most of whom are presently white Zimbabwean citizens, and their mostly black employees and families. Land redistribution is still possible on a number of farms but should be subject to just compensation and a fair process. For the rest, both black and white Zimbabwean citizens and residents deserve full protection under the rule of law, which they do not get at present.</para><para>The Australian public has reacted to greater media coverage of the crisis. An unfortunate consequence from some has been racist reactions. There are Australians who use these sad and horrifying events as an excuse to vent their contempt for blacks, and then there are those who take the view that the whites are getting what they deserve. There are those who can only empathise with whites who are caught up in this crisis. Despots are despots, whether white or black. When Robert Mugabe is described using the term `black despot', it is a sure sign of outrage coloured by racism. Why not just call him a despot? When a call is made for white farmers only to be considered for refugee or favourable immigrant status, that too is racially discriminatory. Such views ignore the many brave and principled black opponents of despotism, and such views oppose Australia's non-discriminatory immigrant and refugee policies.</para><para>Then you get the anti-white racists, those for whom a white skin is enough to sanction rape, murder or beatings. There are those who tut-tut but say that, as colonialists, these white farming families could expect nothing else, ignoring the fact that Zimbabwe has not been a colony since 1965 according to Ian Smith supporters, but certainly for at least 20 years under Robert Mugabe; ignoring the fact that the perpetrators are cynical, political thugs using people too young to have fought in the civil war, often intimidating white Zimbabweans, themselves too young to remember those days or who bought their farms after 1980; ignoring too that there were farmers who opposed the Rhodesian Front of Ian Smith and supported the universal franchise; or ignoring the fact that land reform to date has largely benefited the elite of the ruling ZANU-PF. </para><para>The tragedy for Robert Mugabe is that he is in danger of ending a long, political career being seen as morally bankrupt, in contrast to the respect accorded to a Julius Nyerere or a Nelson Mandela. As the situation deteriorates, the world is rightly concerned that the brightness of hope for a strong and democratic Zimbabwe that there was in 1980 will be replaced by a gloomy example of moral, political, social, environmental and economic degradation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Heavy Vehicles</title><page.no>14354</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>14354</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to raise an issue in relation to a document that was prepared by Roaduser International Pty Ltd for the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson. The document is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Investigations into the Specification of Heavy Trucks and Consequential Effects on Truck Dynamics and Drivers</inline>. </para></talk.start><para>My concern with the investigation into the specification of the heavy trucks is that the report does not contain much, or in some cases any, information that would explain the following: (1) mechanically strung suspensions have a complaint rate of approximately 20 per cent of those vehicles that have air suspensions; (2) international trucks with sprung suspension have a complaint rate of about 10 per cent of the rate for long wheelbase, high powered, air suspended, prime movers; (3) Kenworth has twice the complaint rate compared with other makes; (4) long wheelbase prime movers only appear to have the problem; (5) the risks appears to increase with horsepower; (6) European designed vehicles do not seem to have the problems that are associated with the American designed vehicles; (7) vehicle makes other than Ford with the WD460 suspension stated as a problem have not shown up as complaints; (8) the air pressure in the airbag on one side of the vehicle can be so vastly different to the other side consistently throughout a test and the subsequent impact of this situation in regard to the ride and handling of the vehicleâthis is potentially a lethal situation and appears to signify the malfunction of the system and was not mentioned in the report; (9) vehicles carrying high centre of gravity loads on rigid trailers are more likely to have these complaints which, combined with the airbag problems, contribute to higher risk; and (10) vehicles with bent chassis railsâthat is, the process of forming the chassis rail by bending the steelâor those with unusual tie rod set-ups on the drive suspension are more likely to have these problems.</para><para>Of major concern was the inadequacy of the instrumentation applied to the vehicles to indicate the chassis problems and hence there was little reference to the chassis performance in the final report, including no analysis of the torsion chassis problems. The instrumentation of the vehicles was inadequate to show vibration problems, with more severe side to side vibration problems not being measured. This possibly arises from Roaduser International's lack of comprehensive experience in the field.</para><para>The report did not detail the serious outcome and its inherent potential with a vehicle named F6. I refer now to page 71 of the report. Under the heading `Driver comments', it states:</para><quote><para>The level of steering effort required for vehicle F1 was high on narrow, rough roads; an occasional large steering correction was required on road undulations involving change in road camber and this required a high level of concentration; on the Seymour-Tooborac Road, the vehicle dropped off the camber and moved approximately 500 mm several times.</para></quote><para>.  .  .		.  .  .		.  .  .</para><quote><para>The stability and predictability of response for vehicle F6 was poor and this was considered the worst vehicle for handling; on the Seymour-Tooborac Road, the vehicle tracked into a road undulation and required a strenuous steering correction and a rapid further correction; the vehicle moved rapidly to the right and an oncoming vehicle was required to move out of the way; </para><para>several other incidents of this type of movement occurred. </para></quote><para>Further on in the report in relation to F1 and again F6, under the subheading `Vehicle F1', the report states:</para><quote><para>An incident (Incident 1) was observed where the vehicle was travelling at a speed of 100 km/h on the Tooborac-Seymour road ... where the prime mover yawed and accelerated in an unexpected manner; the measured data is not able to indicate the extent of this incident in terms of lateral displacement on the roadway.</para></quote><para>In other words, the instrumentation on the vehicle could in no way convey the way in which the vehicle was darting across the road.</para><para>The problem appears to lie in the torsional flexibility of the chassis, the key factors being the additional flexibility of the chassis of the long wheelbase vehicles together with the additional stress of carrying large capacities of fuel and the increasing contributing weight factor from high heavy cabins and the tendency to roll from side to side. This could result from the tendency of the vehicle cabins to have a natural roll frequency within the same range as that of the airbag suspension. This may be a reason why the mechanical suspensions are not as inherently unstable in relation to the other factors when compared with air suspensions being used.</para><para>There appear to be some unusual design features. They are: firstly, Kenworth's cross-member design appears to be particularly poor from a deflection point of view; and, secondly, Mack's front engine mount is unusual and is not self-centring. While my aim is not to necessarily denigrate the departments and Roaduser International directly, I must raise questions with regard to Roaduser International's suitability to carry out this very important investigation. Roaduser International had no reputation or significant ex- perience in vibration investigations and analysis prior to the FORS Heavy Vehicle Investigation project. Roaduser International's professional association membership appears to be primarily trade based, with a lack of professional associations. The Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering is essentially a body with little strength and has neither a strict code of professional practice nor a code of ethics.</para><para>There is not sufficient time this evening to raise all of the issues in relation to this report. Therefore, I will at a later date continue my comments with regard to this report.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>14355</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.28 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>14355</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>14355</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Australian Competition and Consumer CommissionâReportsâ</para><para>Telecommunications charges in Australia 1995-99.</para><para>Telecommunications competitive safeguards 1998-99.</para><para>Department of Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsâDigital television reviewsâReportâ</para><para>Volume 1âReports on the reviews.</para><para>Volume 2âDiscussion papers.</para><para>Volume 3âConvergence review.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>14355</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâInstruments Nos CASA 110/00 and CASA 176/00-CASA 183/00.</para><para>Remuneration Tribunal ActâDetermination 2000/02: Parliamentary allowances for expenses of office.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>14356</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Same Sex Next of Kin</title><page.no>14356</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1678)</subtitle><id.no>1678</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14356</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 October 1999:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Does the Australian Defence Force (ADF) recognise a same-sex person designated as `next of kin' for service personnel;

The same-sex partner would be notified in the event of the ADF member being the subject of a casualty report.  The procedures in respect of casualty notification are promulgated in Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 11-2.  A copy has been forward separately to your office.</para><para>(2) ADF personnel who have recognised or legally married opposite sex partners are categorised as members with dependants.  The full conditions of service entitlements for both members with dependants, and members without dependants deployed to East Timor have been promulgated in a series of Australian Defence Headquarters released messages, copies of which have been forwarded separately to your office.</para><para>(3) Same-sex partners of ADF members are not recognised by the ADF, and unless a member has other dependants who are recognised by the ADF, the member is categorised as member without dependants.  The conditions of service entitlements for a member without dependants who is serving in East Timor are as stated in the response to part (2). </para><para>(4) The eligibility for service entitlements depends on the categorisation of a member as member with dependants or member without dependants.  Hence, a member is required to register their categorisation on entry into the ADF and then whenever circumstances cause change to that categorisation.</para><para>(5) (a) The person/s nominated by the ADF member as being their next of kin or person/s to be notified, are notified in the event of the ADF member becoming a casualty.  </para><para>(b) The person/s nominated are advised of any casualty within the limitations detailed in Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 11-2.</para><para>(6) No, No.</para><para>(7) No policy has been drafted or is being developed regarding the possible recognition of ADF same-sex relationships.</para><para>(8) No.</para><para>(9) The Head of the Defence Personnel Executive (HDPE) has been advised of the possible implications of recognising or not recognising same-sex partnerships.  He has advised that the ADF is to continue to not recognise same-sex partnerships.  A copy of the brief to HDPE on this subject has been forwarded separately to your office.</para><para>(10) HDPE has provided advice to the Minister for Defence to me that the ADF intends to retain its current policy to not recognise same-sex partnerships.  A copy of that advice has been forwarded separately to your office.</para><para>(11) (a) to (d) The ADF does not give the same benefits, conditions of service, rights and entitlements to same-sex couples as it does to married and recognised defacto couples.  This is because married members, members in recognised defacto relationships and members with dependants do receive additional entitlements over members without dependants.  These entitlements can include subsidised housing, additional travel to the family home if separated for service reasons and separation allowance.  The answer to this question, therefore, hinges on whether the ADF member is categorised as being a member with dependants or a member without dependants.  An ADF member who is in a same-sex relationship and does not have ADF recognised dependants is classified as being a member without dependants and is entitled to the conditions of service appropriate to that classification.  If both persons in the same-sex relationship were ADF members without recognised dependants, each would be classified as being a member without dependants.</para><para>(12) (a) Yes, as per the promulgated messages referred to in the response to part (2).</para><para>(b) Apart from that support detailed in the response to part (1), partners of non-married ADF members are not provided with any special support unless their relationship is formally recognised as a defacto relationship.</para><para>(c) Apart from the support detailed in the response to part (1), there is no further support provided to same-sex partners of ADF members.</para><para>(13) The ADF would not recommend such an action.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor: Peacekeeping Allowances to Military Personnel</title><page.no>14357</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1752)</subtitle><id.no>1752</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>14357</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 November 1999:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) What allowances are paid to military personnel currently engaged in peacekeeping activities in East Timor.</para><para>	(2) Do the above payments vary with rank; if so, what is the range of these allowances.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>14357</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Assisting the Minister for Defence has provided the following amended answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) The allowances and benefits paid to military personnel currently serving in East Timor are outlined below.</para><para>	(a) The Deployment Allowance payable for service in East Timor is $57.83 per day.
