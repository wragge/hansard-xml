Thank you, Senator Alston. The fact of the matter is that the BAS has the effect of replacing many reporting arrangements which existed under the old system. For example, it would not be unusual for a business to have more than 30 separate tax reporting and payment obligations in any given year. Many businesses had obligations under the reportable payments system and other separate withholding systems. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The first point I would like to make to you, Senator, is that the business activity statement is a one-page form which essentially replaces all of the different forms that businesses were required to use during the year. If, like me, you go around and listen to people in business, you will find that some have been able to cope particularly well with the new system; others have found the first form more difficult. But I think overall the system is working well. Of course, the government is always mindful of comments and suggestions that are made in the wider community, and those comments and suggestions would always be examined, but you have to remember that this was the first occasion on which the BAS form was used for quarterly payments. Those reporting monthly were able to use this form earlier. The first one was the one which had to deal with the transitional arrangements from the old tax system to the new, and many people would find that challenging. </para><para>In relation to the form that we have developed, we have examined very closely what has happened with reporting arrangements in other countries. We have looked closely at their experience and taken their experience. The form that we released was market tested and we took into account those market testing arrangements to make sure that we maximised the straightforward nature of the form. As the Prime Minister has said, we will always listen to constructive comments which are made. My understanding is that the Labor Party strongly supported the new reporting arrangements. I know there was a debate up to 1 July in which the Labor Party said it would not support the GST. Post 1 July, the Labor Party is supporting the GST. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—We don't support the GST; you know that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—The Labor Party has indicated—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—We support tax changes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Excuse me.

He, as a former councillor, would know that local government are ecstatic about the package—and that might be an understatement. All of the senators on this side will have been contacted by their local mayors and councillors congratulating the government on its recognition of this very worthwhile package and the need for additional road funding. They like it because it does address a significant infrastructure problem that has been building since the days when Labor was in power. The $1.2 billion being spent on this local roads program will create jobs and activity, particularly in regional Australia. Creation of jobs, of course, is an excellent side benefit of this program.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline>I am asked by Senator McGauran: have we received endorsements? Of course, the endorsements have just flowed in from right across the range. The Australian Trucking Association, a group that really understands the need for roads, has warmly welcomed the package. The Australian Local Government Association have indicated in their press release that councils across the nation will welcome the federal government's announcement. The Municipal Association of Victoria are saying how pleased they were and that the figure was almost double that of Victoria's annual local road repair bill. The Australian Automobile Association is very much in favour. Even the National Farmers Federation is in favour of it. Some months ago it put out a press release saying that the National Farmers Federation welcomed the decision to back the NFF's call for more spending on roads, funded by the excise increase attributable to the price impact of the GST, and urged the coalition to support this.

It refers to the GST Start-Up Assistance Office and the contract that it entered into with the Tourism Council of Australia. I do have some advice on this matter. Probably much of this advice was given in relation to Senate estimates, but I will go through it again. The contract with the Tourism Council of Australia was signed on 11 November, more than a month prior to the so-called technical insolvency that Senator Conroy apparently advised Senate estimates was reached in December 1999. Technical insolvency, I am advised, can sometimes describe a corporation that has an excess of liabilities over assets. This does not mean, however, that the company is technically insolvent. The legal test, I understand, is that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Let me advise the Senate and Senator Schacht that the TCA delivered the products and services required under the contract, including 65 seminars. My advice is that they were delivered by a major accounting firm and were attended by some 6,638 industry participants. A seminar manual was also provided. </para><para>The funding contracts signed by the GST Start-Up Assistance Office with organisations such as the Tourism Council of Australia have been structured to minimise the Commonwealth's risk. For example, only a component of the contract amount is paid on signature, with the remainder—I think this is important for the question that Senator Schacht raised—paid as instalments after an acquittal of previous payments against the delivery of milestones. In addition, the funds shall only be used to carry out the project in accordance with the budget and during the funding period. The organisation may not use or expend the funds for meeting past deficits or expenditures. Senator Schacht will be delighted that the funds are subject to an independent audit. There are some other aspects of that question which I plan to turn to if Senator Schacht would be kind enough to ask me a supplementary question.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>19896</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You still had half a minute to go, Minister.

The advice I have received is that, in some cases, industry organisations decided that they needed to cater food and beverages for seminars beyond what the GST Start-Up Assistance Office was prepared to sponsor. Of course, there was a wide range of organisations participating in the TCA coordinated workshops. These included the Restaurant Catering Association, the Hotels, Motels and Accommodation Association and a wide range of others. In the case of the Tourism Council contract, the constituent organisations agreed that a higher level of catering was required and that $40 was the appropriate charge.

The donor would also have been required to lodge a disclosure return for a donation totalling $1,500 or more, whether that donor was an individual or a corporation. The penalties, where an offence has been proven for failure or improper disclosure, range from $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the offence committed.</para><para>The provisions in place at the time of the 1996 federal election have been amended.

However, the individual donations of $1,500 or more from a single source in the course of a financial year would need to be totalled and disclosed by the party in an annual return lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission. The Australian Electoral Commission has provided in more detail in its funding and disclosure handbook for candidates the obligations and responsibilities of candidates regarding election funding and disclosure provisions. A copy is sent by the Australian Electoral Commission to every political candidate upon their nomination. I would remind senators that it provides the following advice in relation to record keeping:</para><quote><para>All transactions should be adequately documented and recorded—for instance, receipts should be issued for each donation and gift received ...

I presume Senator Bartlett does want the answer. The vast majority of children in detention are held with their families. The Australian government has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is conscious that children should be detained only as a last resort and for the shortest possible period. Any applications from children and family units in detention are processed as a matter of priority. The department takes its duty of care obligations towards detainees extremely seriously, in particular in regard to the detention of minors. The detention services provider is sensitive to the special needs of children and families. Suitable accommodation for family units and children is made available where possible, and recreational facilities, including playgrounds, toys, games and so on, are provided. Children in all detention centres have access to a range of services, including educational facilities and health and welfare services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Where there are special or extenuating circumstances, certain detainees, including children, may be released into the community on a bridging visa. Criteria for release in this way hinge on appropriate care and welfare arrangements, with the best interests of the child being the primary consideration. The child's best interests are assessed on the particular circumstances in each individual case. Generally, the minister indicates—and I agree—that it would not be in the best interests of a child to be separated from their parents and family. So there are two sides to this very vexed question. As to the detail, I am advised that at 3 November this year 231 minors were in detention. Of the 231, only eight were unaccompanied minors. The total number of children released between 1 November 1999 and 3 November 2000 was 651.

I think the ABC is guilty of very damaging speculation, particularly emanating from its Tokyo correspondent. That speculation is very destructive of the morale of the work force and their families as we approach Christmas. That speculation is also very damaging for the company's sales in Australia and does nothing to help the company in its objective of returning to profitability in this country. </para></talk.start><para>Mitsubishi is an integral part of Australia's car manufacturing industry and is a vital customer for our car components industry. It is also, of course, a vital part of the South Australian economy. I think we all have to be extremely careful about what we say about this company and that we have to avoid, at all costs, loose and unfounded speculation about it. In that vein, I was particularly concerned about the line of questioning indulged in by the opposition in Senate estimates last week. I thought it was very unfair and very self-indulgent. It was unfair on the workers of this company, which the ALP professes to support, to be speculating about the possible closure of that company. I urge the opposition and the media to be cautious and very responsible in their comments on this company and its future in Australia. We all want to ensure that Mitsubishi returns to profitability in Australia. That must remain a central part of our approach to Australia's car industry. We all have to act together to support Mitsubishi in achieving its objective of returning to long-term profitability in Australia.</para><para>For our part, we are working closely with the company here and in Japan to ensure its continuity here. Our new $2 billion ACIS scheme starts on 1 January, and we want to ensure that Mitsubishi takes full advantage of that scheme. We believe that Mitsubishi is very well placed to take advantage of that generous scheme. We have reminded the company that we have instituted a five-year freeze on tariffs at 15 per cent—three times the general tariff rate in Australia of five per cent. We have reminded the company that our tax reforms have taken $2,000 off the price of the average Australian automobile. We have also acted to restrict and control the importation of second-hand cars into this country—something of great concern to the Australian manufacturers and the mainstream importers of new cars. Of course, our economic management has delivered high economic growth and low interest rates, both of which are critical to the car industry. The car industry has had its three best years ever under our 4½ years of government and has just had its best third quarter ever in the history of the Australian car industry. We are committed to a strong Australian car manufacturing industry, as evidenced by our policy settings and our actions. Today's announcement by Mitsubishi of this capital injection is tremendous news for all of us who want Mitsubishi to remain in Australia. I would urge the media and the opposition to support the company and its work force and to not indulge in loose and damaging speculation.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Executive Salaries</title><page.no>19903</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>19903</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Alston representing the Prime Minister.

It is usually recycled at about this time of the day to ensure that the Labor Party supporters realise that the politics of envy are still alive and well. The answer is that a lot of these salary levels are set in the marketplace and are determined by what it is necessary to pay to ensure that you are able to attract the best people to fill a position. We all understand that—it is very much global competition at the top end of the market. In many instances, that will lead to million dollar salary packages. If you are running a very substantial corporation, you do want world's best practice, you do want those places to run very efficiently, and you do want the best people to run them. It is not helped by people like you wandering along to the estimates committee and wasting the time of people who are well paid to get out and make sensible decisions.

Those workers are particularly concerned about ensuring that they get significant increases where the employer has the capacity to pay. They do not want to see inflation rampant once again, as it has been under previous Labor administrations. They do want to share in the profits. They do want to see companies prospering, and they do want to get their fair share. But they do not spend their time at home whipping themselves into a lather of envy, which the Labor Party seems to think is a good way of picking up a few votes. I can assure you that, overwhelmingly, workers want their fair share. They do distinguish between people running huge corporations and people operating in small businesses. They do not think they should all be paid the same amount of money—you might, but they do not. Workers understand that you can be very vulnerable, that you have to pull your weight and that, if you do, you ought to be entitled to a significant increase when the capacity is there to meet it. </para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Welfare Reform: Work for the Dole</title><page.no>19905</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>19905</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Family and Community Services.

Mr Matthews had described the business activity statement as one of the simplest forms in the world. The business activity statement is the new form that has been introduced by the Liberal-National Party, and it is the centrepiece of collection of the goods and services tax. The business activity statement, known as BAS, is part of the goods and services tax administrative requirements introduced by the Liberal-National Party government.</para><para>Senator Kemp, in his response, did not express any particular concern about the ramifications and the complexities of the business activity statement. He did not express any concern at all that businesses, particularly small businesses, have been experiencing problems in relation to completion of the business activity statement. In fact, Senator Kemp said that the `system is working well'. He went on to relate his experience in talking to business, and he said that some had found the system very simple. If he has been talking to business, I am sure it would have been big business—and of course big business do not have problems with the implementation of the goods and services tax . They have in-house lawyers and accountants who can complete these complex forms. </para><para>It is not simply the form, which is two pages long; it is the explanatory booklet—and it is a book—which you are required to read when completing the business activity statement. That booklet is some 150 pages long. It is not a simple matter, as Senator Kemp and the tax office would have us believe, of completing a two-page form. You have to read 150 pages of the explanatory booklet. If the business activity statement were so simple to complete, why have extensions been given by the tax office for completion of it? Initially the date for completion and lodgment was 21 October. This was extended by three weeks to 11 November. Then there was a further extension to 30 November. If the form is so simple to complete, why have there been two extensions to the completion date? The last extension, to 30 November, does come with the parameter that the form has to be lodged through an accounting firm. So tough luck for those small businesses which did not meet the deadline of 11 November and cannot lodge it through an accounting firm. Of course, this does add to the business that accountants receive.</para><para>For the other form, which is required to be lodged by 21 January, there has been a further two-week extension to 4 February. If the form is so simple to complete, why give the extensions? Why are there complaints from people in the business community?

I remind the Senate that this statement brings together a lot of information on one form that was previously provided on a number of forms over many periods of time. This business activity statement is required to be lodged on a monthly basis by the larger taxpayers and on a quarterly basis by the smaller taxpayers. It would appear that certainly the larger taxpayers are not having a lot of trouble. Not surprisingly, given the greater spread of information and the fact that the records of some small businesses will have to be somewhat modified to meet with the new compliance arrangements, there will be a little extra time required by some of the smaller businesses for what we might call catch-up.</para></talk.start><para>I express my disappointment that Senator Sherry has disagreed that perhaps extra time is needed for some of these smaller taxpayers to lodge, in a correct form, information in this new business activity statement. We have a sympathetic Liberal-National Party coalition that recognises the needs of smaller businesses to adopt, and to adapt to, the new configurations and the new arrangements. As part of that there are actually two options that taxpayers are entitled to pursue. I for one would recommend that taxpayers use what is known as option 2, the alternative. Option 2 is sometimes referred to as the accounts derived basis. Under the accounts derived basis, the system is relatively simple. It does not need the detailed calculations required on the back of the business activity statement, which for some may be complex. So if taxpayers pursue option 2, which I recommend—that is, the accounts derived basis—they prepare their cashbooks on the basis of, say, date, particulars, cheque details, cheque amount, the amount of the GST deducted, and then the net amount. Obviously all businesses need to dissect capital into the capital arrangements and to other relevant columns. So the amount that is allowable for income tax purposes, or is attributable to capital or private purposes is deductible over a period of time. The capital component is derived from the net amount paid for the service. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—You've lost me, John.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name></talker><para>—It is very easy to lose you, Senator Sherry, so I suggest that perhaps you listen.

Have you understood that? Because I think everybody else does. If you use the accounts derived basis, where you take the information straight out of your book, it means one extra column in your cash payments book or, if you are a farmer, maybe two extra columns in your cash receipts book. That does not create too many complications. In fact, the time taken to prepare your business activity statement on that basis in terms of the GST is absolutely minimal because the figures are derived merely by taking the difference in the totals of cash payments and receipts journals, which is the GST payable. and I presume you would reconcile your books every quarter. Therefore, the system takes very little time.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>If you pay wages, the second component on the BAS statement, I think everybody would concede that there is no additional time needed for the amount of information required on the business activity statement for the payment of wages, total wages and amount deducted compared with previously.

We could have copied it down, sent it out to all those small businesses that are experiencing extreme difficulty in dealing with the business activity statement and, more importantly, to all those accountants out there who are providing them with advice and who are taking substantial amounts of time to complete these forms. Senator Watson makes it sound as if it is a walk in the park. From my point of view, I cannot for one moment understand why there are all these complaints out in the community about the business activity statement. Senator Watson has made it sound so easy. He is wasting his time in this chamber; he should be out there advising small business how to deal with the business activity statement and the application of the GST.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that it is not as simple as that. It is much more complex for ordinary business people out in the real world to deal with the GST. For example, at estimates, Mr Matthews from the Australian Taxation Office was asked about the degree of difficulty being experienced by people in completing and submitting the business activity statement. He fudged the answer to the question. He avoided answering the question because the tax office has never attempted to find out the degree of difficulty that small businesses are confronting in trying to complete these forms and to meet the timetables that have been imposed upon them in terms of the GST. That issue was avoided. But we do know there are substantial difficulties being confronted by small businesses. As part of the petrol inquiry that the Labor Party has been conducting, I took part in a hearing in Raymond Terrace where we had a small business person—an independent truck owner—give evidence. This person was not your average truckie, as we would define them as being—and that is not a derogatory term, Senator Hutchins, by any means. This person was an ex-schoolteacher. In fact, he still taught at one of the high schools in the Newcastle area. He said that in terms of completing his business activity statement, it took 18 hours of his own time, seven hours on the phone consulting—I think he said with his daughter or his sister who was an auditor/accountant—plus additional time with his accountant to be able to complete the form. This is someone whom you would regard as being fairly literate, who would be able to read and understand the form, but who took something like 25 to 30 hours to be able to complete that form and who says the impost being put on small business to be able to comply with the requirements of the law in that area is an absolute outrage. </para><para>There are many other examples. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 23 November, Brian Toohey poses the question:</para><quote><para>Backed by numerous public comments from accountants and business proprietors, bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the business organisation, Australian Business Ltd, have suggested the BAS really needs to ask only two key questions so far as the GST is concerned. </para><para>Both questions occur on the front page of the existing form: how much GST is payable, and how much of this can be offset by credits for GST paid. The difference between the two figures would give the amount to be forward to the Australian Tax Office or due as refund. </para></quote><para>He goes on to say that the form could be substantially simplified if that approach were adopted.</para><para>The questions that beg answering are whether or not the form that has been designed by the Australian Taxation Office is for the purpose of identifying the amount of GST required to be paid, whether or not it has a wider role in terms of tax collection and is being used to monitor the activities of companies on a broader basis to ensure that there is no tax evasion or the like, and whether or not the form is beyond what is needed in order to meet that commitment. The other headline that I would like to refer to is from 20 November in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian: </inline>`BAS has agents fleeing profession'. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>19909</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on Senator Sherry's motion to take note of Senator Kemp's answer to Senator Buckland's question about the business activity statement and to remind the Senate and any listeners that we are talking about the reporting requirement for the new tax system. We have changed the tax system very substantially. We have got rid of wholesale sales tax. We have brought in a new tax—the GST. We have changed income tax. We have changed the reporting requirements on the pay-as-you-go-basis. The government is very sympathetic—all of us are sympathetic—to the confusion being experienced by businesses in having to adjust to the changes of forms. But I remind the Senate of what a typical small business had to do in the past. On an annual basis, if they had some employees, they had to complete at least four PAYE returns and payments, four provisional tax payments, up to 12 prescribed payments remittances and up to four fringe benefits tax payments. Some of them also had reportable payments systems and other separate withholding systems that they had to report on. Medium-sized firms had 12 reports per year for PAYE, four company tax instalments and 12 obligations for prescribed payments, up to 12 on sales tax payments, as well as the fringe benefits tax.</para></talk.start><para>So we have a brand new system and, sure, there have been difficulties in learning how to adjust to it. That is what the trouble has been about—people learning the system. However, the facts are that the system has been well designed. The tax office and the government took advice internationally. In fact, at the estimates last week the tax office tabled a document from the International Monetary Fund which set out the international advice to countries on what should be in the returns on VAT or GST—and our forms fit in with that. It was also reported that the tax office studied in great detail the GST returns from New Zealand. The GST part of the BAS is in fact simpler in the Australian form than in the New Zealand one. The confusion has arisen because we have married the PAYE, the prescribed payments system and the FBT system into the pay-as-you-go in the one single form.</para><para>However, the system is working quite well. As was reported in Senate estimates hearings last week, 300,000 businesses have been reporting on a monthly basis since the start of this financial year, with only about one per cent `error rate' in timing. Of the smaller businesses reporting on a quarterly basis, 1.5 million have sent in their forms and their payments, and the tax office expects a total of 1.6 million. I remind the Senate and listeners that the deadline for quarterly reporting was the 11th of this month except if reporting through an accountant or tax agent, when the deadline is Thursday of this week—so there is still time for people to get their report in. As my colleague Senator Watson said, a lot of the confusion has derived from the fact that there are two options for doing the work. There is the option of doing it on the form with the calculation sheet on the back that has been sent out to all businesses, which is fine if your business is quite simple. As Senator Watson said, you just make simple modifications to the cash payments and cash receipts columns in your books. The alternative accounts derived scheme simply means you fill in the key bits from the accounts, which for lots of businesses are now done by computer.</para><para>The other interesting item tendered in the estimates hearings last week was that over 50 per cent of the quarterly returns from small businesses to the tax office were done by the businesses themselves, not with the assistance of an accountant. That says that a lot of people have been making their personal effort and getting on with the job. I am sure in the next quarterly return early next year, at the end of January and in February, we will see a much lower complaint rate, we will see a much lower error rate, and we will get a good result. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>19910</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Anybody who was listening to the broadcast this afternoon or reads the speeches of two very honourable and learned senators on the other side, Watson and Gibson, who lectured us on the basic niceties of this new scheme, would be confused that we have this new super-duper scheme that is `simple, fairer and more equitable'. If you think about it, Madam Deputy President, and you read the correspondence that you may have received in your role as a senator from New South Wales, you would come to the same conclusion that I and many other people in the community have come to: this system is not simpler or fairer but is far more complex and is indeed unfair, and in particular unfair to small business.</para></talk.start><para>I subscribe to a magazine called the <inline font-style="italic">Owner//Driver</inline>. Unlike, I imagine, a number of other senators in this place, in my previous occupation for nearly 17 years I represented the interests of small businesses through the lorry owner-drivers in the TWU. So I might be expected to know a little bit about how they manage and operate their businesses. In this month's edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Owner//Driver</inline>, in one of their regular columns Mrs Pam McMillan writes about the difficulties with the business activity statement. I might add that I would not think Mrs McMillan, whom I think I may have met over the years, would generally be a supporter of some of the positions I would take. She asks, rhetorically I suppose, at the beginning of her article:</para><quote><para>How are you all going with the figures for your Business Activity Statement?</para></quote><para>She goes on:</para><quote><para>I don't have a problem with the theory of it ...</para></quote><para>So we have in this article a person writing about the GST and the business activity statement who is in general supporting the coalition. But what Mrs McMillan says is this:</para><quote><para>My really major, major problem has been with recipient created tax invoices and the deductions made by prime contractors.</para><para>If anyone has any advice on how to deal with multiple deductions off an individual RCTI and then a lump sum deduction off the payment as well I would be really grateful.</para><para>I have spent literally hours and hours trying to get the figure right in my program, the programmers have not answered my emails, faxes or phone calls and the Tax Office says they don't know and they don't believe the computer people have it worked out either.</para></quote><para>She then goes on:</para><quote><para>I realise that I am just a little fish in a very big sea, but my protestations fell on deaf ears when all of this was being set up with governments, the Tax Office and our learned friends in Canberra.</para></quote><para>She concludes in this part of the article:</para><quote><para>And I would really love to know just how many of our decision makers were in actual fact subcontractors, who just like prime contractors have to balance their books and be accountable.</para></quote><para>That is Mrs McMillan, a person who says she supports in theory the practice of what the government has done. As you well know, Madam Deputy President, since this scheme was introduced small businesses have had to go from filling out one statement a year to five. You know as well as I do that big businesses are much more advantaged in this scheme; they have a bevy of accountants and lawyers to assist them in assessing their books. They are overwhelmingly advantaged in this scheme. The firm Morgan and Banks conducted a survey, last month I think it was, and they reported that when they surveyed small business 92 per cent of them said their profitability was down because they were redirecting their activities from being involved in services and sales to making sure they filled out the taxation forms correctly. And rightly so, I imagine, considering that you will be stung with a $10 million fine if you are a small business and you have not filled it out correctly. But I challenge the government to go after any of the big business mates they have if they do not fill out their forms correctly, because the system favours them overwhelmingly. You know as well as I do, Madam Deputy President, that this Prime Minister said that he would reduce paperwork and get rid of red tape. That has not happened as a result of the introduction of this scheme. It is now more cumbersome and more unfair on small business. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detention of Children</title><page.no>19911</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>19911</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today, relating to the numbers of children in immigration detention centres.</para></motion><para>The question and the response by the Minister for Justice and Customs concerned Australia's policy of mandatory detention, particularly in relation to the number of children that are contained and confined in detention centres throughout Australia at the moment. As the minister herself confirmed in her answer, that number of children runs into many hundreds. Many of those are there for extended periods of time. The minister stated that, particularly with children, attempts are made to process claims as quickly as possible. I do not dispute the government's statement in that regard, but what needs to be said is that there is still a significant length of time involved in many cases with these children. It is an indefinite length of time, particularly if their claim is linked to a family member, as it often is. It is not automatic that, if one member of a family is given a protection visa, the others also get that protection visa. In many cases, the length of time that is involved will be linked to the time that the whole family take to have their claims assessed, not just the assessment of the claim of the child in question.</para><para>Last week a lot of attention was drawn to one particular allegation—a very serious allegation—of child sexual abuse involving a 12-year-old child, from memory, in the Woomera detention centre. Whilst it is appropriate that the government investigate that, and the Democrats support that, we do believe that trying to insist that this is a one-off single incident or one-off single allegation is most misleading. There are any number of allegations of ill-treatment, not just of children but of others in detention centres too. They have been raised frequently by staff and former staff of those centres, particularly nurses, as well as by agencies that deal with people when they have been found to be refugees, particularly after they are released from detention centres. </para><para>To suggest that this is only one allegation and that everything is fine is simply misleading. Again we need to particularly look at the issue of children. The Democrats have been on the record for many years as being opposed to the policy of mandatory detention, but it nonetheless is one that this government, and the Labor opposition as well, maintain their support for. In that context, I think the least we can do, particularly in the light of recent allegations, is to reconsider whether this is the best place for a child. The suggestion that the minister made that it is best to keep them with their family is a furphy. Of course it is best for a child to be with their family, assuming the family is not abusing them in some way, as has been alleged in one or two particular cases. But is it best for a child to be kept with their family in a detention centre for an indefinite length of time, surrounded by people some of whom the minister himself, Minister Ruddock, makes a great habit of trying to imply are of dubious reputation? He besmirches their reputation, yet he is quite happy for children to be locked up in the same detention centre as the people that he suggests may be of dubious character and of a sufficient threat to Australia that we cannot possibly consider releasing them into the general community. Yet we are quite happy for children to stay for indefinite periods of time with these same people in detention centres rather than in the Australian community, surrounded by support from welfare organisations and, in many cases, relatives or others from the relevant ethnic community who are not only quite willing but keen to provide assistance and support to people in need such as these children.</para><para>It is completely misleading to suggest that somehow it would be not in the child's interests for them to be out of detention centres just because it would require them to be separated from their parents. You do not have to separate them from their parents; it is just that the government insists on maintaining the support for mandatory detention at all costs at all times except in very extenuating circumstances. This is not a last resort where we have to keep people locked up only if there is a danger to the community. It is a deliberate ongoing policy, and the minister has implied more than once that it is a deliberate infliction of punishment as a deterrent for people so that they do not come here in an unauthorised way. It is inflicting a punishment on people, many of whom at the end of the day are determined by our own system to be legitimate refugees fleeing persecution. Somehow or other, we think it is okay for them to be punished further in the process when they have committed no crime. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT,The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

font-weight="bold">Introduction</inline></para><para>The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill is the most significant development in the area of privacy law in Australia since the passage of the Privacy Act in 1988.</para><para>Based on industry benchmarks—and over twelve months of intensive consultation with Australian business, consumers and privacy advocates—the Bill establishes national standards for the handling of personal information by the private sector.</para><para>For the first time, Australians can be confident that information held about them by private sector organisations will be stored, used and disclosed in a fair and appropriate way.</para><para>For the first time, Australians will have a right to gain access to that information and a right to correct it if it is wrong.</para><para>This Bill is about confidence building.</para><para>It is about giving consumers confidence in Australian business practices.</para><para>It is about giving business confidence in a more level playing field.</para><para>It is about giving the international community confidence that personal information sent to Australia will be stored safely and handled properly.</para><para>While some businesses in Australia are leading the way by putting in place codes of practice which commit them to handling personal information in a fair and responsible way, these good business practices are not consistent.  The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill, with its co-regulatory approach, provides a national, consistent and clear set of standards to encourage and support good privacy practices.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Electronic Commerce</inline></para><para>The Bill is one element of the Government's strategy to ensure that full advantage is taken of the opportunities presented by electronic commerce and the information economy for Australian business and Australian consumers.</para><para>While more and more people are recognising the advantages of using information technology, it is also clear that they are increasingly concerned about privacy issues.</para><para>This concern, if not addressed, has the potential to significantly influence consumer choices about whether or not to participate in electronic commerce. </para><para>The Bill provides a framework within which Australian business will be able to address these concerns effectively and efficiently.</para><para>There is no doubt in my mind that businesses that demonstrate a commitment to protecting the privacy of their customers will gain a competitive advantage.</para><para>Addressing privacy concerns is clearly smart business.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">International Framework</inline></para><para>It is smart business domestically but it is also smart business internationally.</para><para>Increasingly, important trading partners are requiring an assurance that information will be given appropriate protection.</para><para>This Bill will ensure that Australia is in a position to meet international obligations and concerns and that we are not disadvantaged in the global information market.</para><para>The Bill draws on the 1980 OECD Guidelines for the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which represent a consensus among our major trading partners on the basic principles that ought to be built into privacy regulation.</para><para>It will also implement certain obligations under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</para><para>The Bill is intended to facilitate trade in information between Australian and foreign organisations.</para><para>Without such legislative measures, this trade may be adversely affected.  The 1995 `European Union Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data' restricts the transfer of personal information from member countries to other countries unless adequate privacy safeguards are in place.</para><para>I am confident that this Bill will provide adequate privacy safeguards to facilitate future trade with EU members.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Consultative Process</inline></para><para>The real strength of this legislation stems from the highly interactive way in which it has been developed.</para><para>The standards in the Bill are based on the National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information, which were developed by the Privacy Commissioner following extensive consultation with business, consumers and other stakeholders.</para><para>The National Principles are a set of guidelines for the collection, holding, use, disclosure and transfer of personal information.</para><para>The Government's commitment to a fully consultative process continued following the announcement in December 1998 that we would legislate.</para><para>A Core Consultative Group was established with a membership drawn from peak business, consumer and privacy groups.</para><para>The States and Territories were also represented.</para><para>The Group provided an invaluable arena in which to test and develop various legislative models and to examine how each model would operate in practice.</para><para>In addition, the Privacy Commissioner was asked to consult with health stakeholders as to how the National Privacy Principles should be modified to deal with health information.</para><para>An information paper issued in September last year, followed by a successful series of public consultation meetings in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, and draft key provisions made public in December attracted a large number of submissions.</para><para>Drawing on this input and feedback has allowed us to draft a Bill which, I believe, will establish the best possible scheme for the Australian context.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Amend Existing Privacy Act</inline></para><para>The Bill will amend the existing Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988, which currently regulates the handling of personal information by the public sector.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Broad Outline of Provisions</inline></para><para>The Bill will require organisations to comply with minimum standards in relation to how they handle personal information.</para><para>The standards for handling personal information are contained in ten principles, known as the National Privacy Principles, or NPPs.</para><para>The NPPs regulate the collection; use and disclosure; and transfer overseas of personal information.</para><para>They require organisations to ensure that the personal information they hold is accurate, up-to-date and complete; and secure.</para><para>Organisations are also required to be open about how they manage personal information; provide access and correction rights to individuals; and allow people to deal with them anonymously, if that is legal and practical.</para><para>The NPPs also regulate the adoption, use and disclosure of Commonwealth Government identifiers by private sector organisations. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Privacy codes</inline></para><para>A key feature of the co-regulatory approach in the Bill is that it enables organisations to develop their own privacy codes.</para><para>These codes must be approved by the Privacy Commissioner.</para><para>Before approving a code, the Commissioner must be satisfied that it  provides at least as much privacy protection as the NPPs.</para><para>Private sector organisations are, however, free to adopt higher standards.</para><para>The NPPs in the Bill will operate where an organisation chooses not to adopt its own privacy code or does not have a code that has been approved by the Privacy Commissioner.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Complaint handling</inline></para><para>The complaint-handling process in the Bill will enable people to have their complaints dealt with simply, quickly, at low cost and without red tape. </para><para>It is designed to ensure that most complaints can be resolved through conciliation and mediation, rather than through an adversarial court process.</para><para>In the first instance, complaints are to be directed to the organisation concerned.</para><para>If matters are not able to be resolved at that level, then an independent person may investigate the complaint. </para><para>Where the organisation has a privacy code and a mechanism for handling complaints, the independent investigator will be an adjudicator nominated under the code.</para><para>In those instances where an organisation does not have a complaint mechanism, the Privacy Commissioner will handle the complaint.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Review of decisions</inline></para><para>If an individual and organisation are unable to reach a satisfactory outcome through mediation or conciliation, the Privacy Commissioner or a code adjudicator may make a determination.</para><para>In both cases, the decision making process may be judicially reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</para><para>A determination made by the Privacy Commissioner or a code adjudicator may be enforced in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Service.  While the Bill puts in place a scheme that is intended to support self- regulation, there will be a level of judicial oversight to ensure compliance with decisions of code adjudicators and the Privacy Commissioner.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Health</inline></para><para>The Government recognises that Australians consider their personal health information to be particularly sensitive and that they expect all those who come into contact with it to handle it fairly and appropriately.</para><para>Following consultation with health stakeholders, it was agreed that the NPPs be modified to accommodate the particular sensitivities surrounding the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information.</para><para>The modified Principles are designed to ensure an appropriate balance between privacy interests and other important public interests, such as the promotion of research and the effective planning and delivery of health services.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Research</inline></para><para>The balance between the interests of privacy and the need to facilitate medical research was an issue that the Privacy Commissioner and the Government looked at closely.</para><para>The Bill provides that where information is collected for research purposes it must be collected with consent or, where this is not practicable, in accordance with strict safeguards set out in the Bill.</para><para>In addition, researchers must take reasonable steps to de-identify personal information before the results of research can be disclosed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Access</inline></para><para>It is a fundamental principle of fair information handling that individuals be able to access and correct information about them.</para><para>The Bill provides for access to health information, except where legitimate and justifiable grounds exist for refusing access.</para><para>Such grounds include situations where providing an individual with access to their health information would pose a serious threat to the life or health of that or any other person.</para><para>In providing this right to health consumers, the Bill supports what is already good practice among many health professionals.</para><para>The Government acknowledges that the health profession already has a strong respect for the confidentiality of health information about individuals and maintains sound privacy practices in that respect.</para><para>The Bill is not intended to interfere with those professional values and standards.</para></quote><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Outsourcing</inline></para><para>Another area where special issues arise is where Government services involving personal information are outsourced to the private sector.</para><para>In these circumstances, it is important to ensure that personal information is given the same level of protection it would receive if it was held by Government and that, in specified circumstances, the contracting Government agency remains ultimately responsible for the acts and practices of its contractors.</para><para>Where an organisation provides services under contract to the Commonwealth Government, the legislation makes clear that the contract will be the primary source of a contractor's privacy obligations in respect of the personal information collected or held for the purpose of performing the contract.</para><para>The NPPs, or an approved code, will only apply to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the contract.</para><para>As an extra safeguard, the Bill provides that a contractor may not use or disclose personal information for direct marketing purposes unless this is required by the contract.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">State/Territory Instrumentalities</inline></para><para>The Bill is not intended to cover State and Territory public sector agencies, as this is a matter for the States and Territories themselves.</para><para>The Bill recognises that State and Territory Government Business Enterprises, or GBEs, take many forms and that the dividing line between the public and private sectors is not always clear.</para><para>In order to ensure certainty, the Bill provides that GBEs that are incorporated under the Corporations Law will automatically be covered by the Bill, unless they are prescribed otherwise by regulation.</para><para>Those GBEs not incorporated under the Corporations Law, such as  statutory corporations, will not be covered by the Bill.</para><para>To meet the varying requirements of State and Territory Governments, however, the Bill also provides a flexible opt in/opt out mechanism for prescribing State or Territory instrumentalities.</para><para>This will be achieved by regulation and will only be done at the request of the State or Territory Government.</para><para>The policy behind this mechanism is to ensure that State and Territory Government functions can continue unaffected by the Bill, whilst allowing for  State and Territory GBEs that are performing substantially commercial functions to be treated on a level playing field with other private sector organisations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">State/Territory Law</inline></para><para>By introducing this Bill, the Commonwealth intends to establish a single comprehensive national scheme for the protection of personal information by the private sector.</para><para>However, State and Territory laws will continue to operate to the extent that they are not directly inconsistent with the terms of the Bill.</para><para>The NPPs recognise the operation of State and Territory legislation and the common law.</para><para>For example, while the Principles provide for a right of access to personal information held about an individual, they also contemplate a situation in which that access may be denied if this denial is required or authorised by law.</para><para>While there may be some situations of direct inconsistency, I expect that, in the majority of cases, existing State and Territory laws will continue unaffected by this Bill.</para><para>The existing law will simply be supplemented by the standards contained in the NPPs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Exemptions</inline></para><para>It is widely acknowledged that the right to privacy is not an absolute right.  Like all rights, the individual's right to privacy must be balanced against a range of other community and public interests.</para><para>The objects clause of the Bill highlights this need for a balanced approach.  The structure and principles underlying the legislation, as well as a limited range of express exemptions, ensures there is an appropriate and workable balance.</para><para>The Bill does not apply, for example, to information collected for personal, family or household affairs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Small Business</inline></para><para>Similarly, while protecting privacy is an important goal, it must be balanced against the need to avoid unnecessary costs on small business.</para><para>For this reason, only small businesses that pose a high risk to privacy will be required to comply with the legislation.</para><para>Small business is defined in the legislation.</para><para>A business is a small business if its annual turnover for the previous financial year was $3 million or less.</para><para>Such businesses will be exempt unless they hold personal health information and provide a health service; trade in personal information; are a Commonwealth contracted service provider; are related to a business that is not a small business; or are prescribed by regulation. </para><para>The power to prescribe small businesses, or particular acts or practices of small businesses, provides a flexible way to ensure that other risks to privacy can be brought within the legislation where that is necessary and in the public interest.</para><para>In considering whether the circumstances justify bringing small businesses within the regulatory scheme, the Privacy Commissioner must be consulted.</para><para>I also intend to consult with the minister responsible for small business before making a decision on such a regulation.</para><para>While the Government is saying that small business generally does not have to comply with the legislation, it is not saying that a small business cannot or should not comply.</para><para>With increasing demands from consumers and larger business partners for greater respect for privacy, more small businesses are recognising that good privacy practices are good business practices.</para><para>The Bill provides a mechanism whereby small businesses can choose to voluntarily opt-in to the privacy regime. </para><para>This will allow them to capitalise on the increased consumer and business confidence that results from sound privacy practices.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Employee Records</inline></para><para>The Bill also includes an exemption for employee records.</para><para>An "employee record" is defined to capture the types of personal information about employees typically held by employers on personnel and other similar files.</para><para>While this type of personal information is deserving of privacy protection, it is the Government's view that such protection is more properly a matter for workplace relations legislation.</para><para>It should be noted, however, that the exemption is limited to collection, use or disclosure of employee records where this directly relates to the employment relationship.</para><para>This is designed to preclude an employer selling personal information contained in an employee record to a direct marketer, for example.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Media</inline></para><para>The media in Australia have a unique and important role in keeping the Australian public informed.</para><para>In developing the Bill the Government has sought to achieve a balance between the public interest in allowing a free flow of information to the public through the media and the individual's right to privacy.</para><para>In order to achieve this balance, the Bill does not apply to acts and practices of media organisations in the course of journalism where the media organisation has publicly committed itself to observing published standards that deal with privacy in a media context.</para><para>A range of other provisions in the Bill also recognise the important role of the media in facilitating the free flow of information to the public.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Political Parties</inline></para><para>The Bill also includes an exemption for political representatives where acts or practices are related to participation in the political process including referendums and elections at the local, State or Federal level.</para><para>Freedom of political communication is vitally important to the democratic process in Australia.</para><para>This exemption is designed to encourage that freedom and enhance the operation of the electoral and political process in Australia.</para><para>I am confident that it will not unduly impede the effective operation of the legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Transitional Arrangements</inline></para><para>In order to allow time for the private sector to develop codes, revise existing codes and put appropriate practices in place, the Bill will only come into operation 12 months after it receives Royal Assent.</para><para>In addition, most small businesses will not be subject to the legislation for a further period of 12 months after it comes into force.</para><para>The Government appreciates that small business needs to focus on implementing the new tax system.</para><para>The extra time given to small business will provide opportunity for them to implement the changes to the tax system before turning to how they will handle personal information.</para><para>Small businesses that involve the provision of health services will not, however, receive the benefit of the additional 12 month period.</para><para>This is because the Government recognises that information held by health service providers is particularly sensitive and in this situation it is important to have privacy protection in place as soon as possible for the community.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Review by the Privacy Commissioner</inline></para><para>This Bill establishes a new approach to the protection and handling of personal information in the private sector.</para><para>Because our approach is unique, the Government is committed to assessing the operation of the legislation, to ensure that it is achieving all our goals. </para><para>I propose that the Privacy Commissioner conduct a formal review of the operation of the legislation, and of all the exemptions, in consultation with key stakeholders after it has been in operation for two years.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>In developing this legislation the Government has drawn extensively on consultation and feedback provided by Australian business, consumers and privacy advocates.</para><para>As a result, the Bill will establish a scheme that is responsive to both business and consumer needs and that implements privacy protection in a realistic, balanced and workable way.</para><para>It represents the very best of Australian policy development and law making and will help to ensure that Australian business and Australian consumers are in a position to take full and confident advantage of the future in the fast developing information economy.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>)

It is the children of Australia who stand to lose under this government's proposals. We have this proposition today which suggests that the government refuses the Senate's request. It has refused to give more money to schoolchildren with a disability. I remind the Senate that government schools educate 80 per cent of all the disabled children in Australia. Some 85,000 disabled students in Australia go to government schools. There are some 13,000 students with disabilities in non-government schools, 8,000 of whom are in the Catholic sector. Under Labor's plan, as carried by this Senate and sent through as a request to the government in the House of Representatives, we were seeking to increase fourfold the funding for students with disabilities in government schools and to double the amount going to students in non-government schools who have disabilities.</para><para>Frankly, I find it difficult to understand why the government is doing what it is doing. Quite honestly, I find it difficult to understand how some ministers in this government can actually sleep at night. I just cannot understand how Dr Kemp and his colleagues can face the people of Australia and tell them that, no, the government is not prepared to take this amount of money away from these category 1 private schools—the $145 million that it is giving to these schools—and redirect these funds to children who need them most; that is, children with disabilities in both sectors. As far as I can see, this is straightforward callousness by this government. </para><para>I can understand how some people might put the view that the vast increase, the largesse, that this government is heaping on category 1 schools is a result of some unintended consequence, an accident if you like. I can understand how some people might say that surely the government did not intend to heap all of this money on these schools, which already have such lavish facilities and which already cater for the needs of families who can afford up to $14,000 per year per child. I can understand why some people might say that surely Dr Kemp did not intend this with his new SES model. The problem is that Dr Kemp himself says that the aim of this bill is to provide extra funds to the neediest non-government schools. </para><para>Perhaps it is just an accident, but in reality what happens under this bill is that it is not the neediest schools but the most elite, most powerful and most wealthy schools in this country which get the most out of it. We are entitled to ask why these measures have in fact occurred because, if it is just an accident, surely it is now up to the government itself to move to address the clear injustices that have been exposed through the processes of this parliament. Surely it is up to the government itself to acknowledge that it has made a mistake and that the funds that are going to the most privileged in our educational communities would be better directed to those in greater need. Surely it would do that.</para><para>Then again, perhaps it is the case that this government, under Dr Kemp's administration of the education department, has meant to do exactly what it has actually done. Maybe it is the case that the government is refusing to shift these funds away from the richest to the most needy schools because it had intended, right from the very start, to produce such unequal and unjust outcomes. Maybe it is the case that this government has simply acted callously and, as some would say, immorally.</para><para>The Labor Party take a different view on these questions: we sincerely believe that education should be funded on the basis of need. That principle ought to extend to both the government sector and the non-government sector. As far as we are concerned, Labor's policies on funding for the neediest non-government schools are clearly stated and have been spelt out on numerous occasions. While we were in office, we did redirect money to those particular communities. Labor have said that there are basic principles involved in the funding of educational options for Australia's children. If people wish to send their children to Catholic, Jewish or Islamic schools or to any others of different religious groups, and if those schools are poorly equipped, poorly staffed and their buildings are rundown, the government has a responsibility to provide assistance. That is, schools have a right, an entitlement, to minimum community standards.</para><para>What we have seen of course is that under this government there has been a widening of the gap between the educational haves and have-nots and that, in my judgment, the Commonwealth has overseen an extension of those inequalities. We have some 7,000 government schools in Australia and they have suffered dramatically under this government's policies. In fact, we have seen this government shift the priorities away from genuine need, and it has produced this artificial and inflated measure that will see millions of dollars go to those that are already privileged. We argue, and I think the overwhelming majority of Australians share this view, that we have an obligation in this country to ensure that there is a strong public sector, a very high quality public sector. What we have seen is this government's constant denigration of the public sector. We believe that it is a government's responsibility to ensure that every child has access to a decent education in a government school. This is not a view shared by the government. In government Labor will be committed to providing for all Australian kids and their families, and our priorities will be on public education. That goes not just for schools but for universities, the vocational educational system and our TAFE colleges. On the other hand, this government has no commitment to the provision of a strong public sector.</para><para>Under this government, we have seen a shift in the amount of money going to government schools: from 43 per cent of total Commonwealth funding in 1996 down to 34 per cent by the year 2004. We have seen proposals by this government to provide $700 million in extra funding for the four years—that is way beyond indexation—to private schools and, in particular, to the wealthier schools within that group. There is no matching increase for the 70 per cent of students in this country that attend government schools. We also see that quite extraordinary measures are being taken in other areas by this government—take, for instance, the enrolment benchmark adjustment and the breathtaking inequality that is implicit in that arrangement. We can see quite clearly a deeply irrational and very unfair measure being taken by this government in trying to impose that. Our amendments will abolish the EBA. </para><para>What is quite clear in all of this is that there is an enormous groundswell within the community. There is enormous awareness now of just how unfair, unjust and divisive the government's policies are. It is to the government's electoral peril that they do not accept the proposals that the Senate has put to them, because these are issues that we will be pursuing. The government have made it clear that they do not at this point intend to accept the Labor Party's amendments and requests from the Senate. We will be seeking that the government be given an opportunity to reconsider their position. There is an opportunity here today for the Senate to say to the government, `Come to your senses on these matters and reconsider the position you have taken,' because we will be recommending to the Senate that these requests be pressed. We will be voting against the government's motion today. While there are a few other things I need to say, I understand that other senators here need to make comment on this matter as well, so I will return to this in a moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>19923</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate that the Democrats will be voting against the government's motion today. The Democrats reluctantly supported the ALP's amendment to divert the $57 million or so from category 1 schools to special education funding, and our reluctance stemmed from the failure of the ALP to do more than tinker with the edges of this unfair SES formula. I remind the Senate that most of the Democrats amendments would have produced a much fairer model, and our preferred amendment would have seen a 12-month extension of the current arrangements so that a proper debate could be conducted and so that we could look at not only a fairer model but what is actually required to fund a decent level of education across the board. As an outcome of that review, we would have understood that the $6,000 or so which is currently spent on every student in government schools is hopelessly inadequate. Of course, private schools understand this, and that is why in some cases the fees in such schools are even twice that amount. If you top that up with both federal and state funding and other income to the school, you are looking at many schools spending almost three times as much on their students as we spend on students in government schools. </para></talk.start><para>However, to get back to the motion of the government today, special education is an area of enormous need. There is far more that the federal government could be doing, and so we support the extra injection of funding. It is a disgrace, for instance, that the strategic assistance per capita grants have been broadbanded into literacy and numeracy funding. It will make it just that much harder to identify from year to year how money is being spent and on what. Special needs encompass far more than literacy and numeracy. No doubt it gives Dr Kemp some pleasure to boast that his government is spending more than ever on literacy and numeracy, but a fair amount of this so-called new money is really just old money being recycled. It is also disgraceful that Dr Kemp's promise to non-government schools that they would be no worse off was not extended to special needs students in government schools. I think that it is simply cheap and miserable of this government to reduce the per capita rates for secondary students from $126 to $102. I see that this amount has been increased to $110, but it is still a very small amount and it is still not enough.</para><para>This government still refuses to address the resourcing issues raised by learning disabilities and difficulties. There is no national strategy on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder four years after the National Health and Medical Research Council recommended a federal policy to tackle this very alarming issue. It does not seem to faze Dr Kemp that hundreds of children are being medicated for ADD and ADHD. Medication is supposed to be a last resort, but for most families it is the only resort because testing and multimodal treatment are prohibitively expensive. I would like to see some of this extra $50 million or so go towards formulating an appropriate response to these realities. Under this legislation, non-government special schools will be funded at 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost, which, as I said earlier, is just over $6,000. This seems a meaningless, arbitrary figure when you consider how labour and resource intensive it is to deliver quality education to many children with disabilities. Under this legislation, most special schools will be getting funding increases of around $40,000 a year, with the biggest increase being $180,000. </para><para>It seems only fair to support an amendment which will quadruple the per capita amount for special needs students in government schools and double the amount going to non-government schools. However, what bothers me about this legislation is the fact that, although it will be easier for non-government schools to take in students with special needs, there is still no requirement for them to do so, even in return for the extra cash. Parents of children with disabilities say that money is often not the primary issue here. Resources are often cited by non-government schools as an obstacle to taking children with disabilities, but they say schools are often reluctant to take on students with intellectual disabilities in particular because they do not want to complicate things or to sully the institution's reputation for academic prestige.</para><para>The Democrats would be very interested to know how many students with disabilities attend the category 1, 2 and 3 schools that are getting so much out of this formula. Not one has come out publicly to say that they will take on more students with special needs. I suspect they are usually shunted off to underresourced government sector schools. I wonder how many parents Dr Kemp spoke to about this issue. One group, Queensland Parents of People with a Disability, say that if Dr Kemp really did consult with the community, are they not part of it—because he did not consult with them. The fact is that for most parents of children with special needs there is no such thing as choice. For all Dr Kemp's rhetoric about choice, these families will not gain much, if anything. Eighty per cent of children with disabilities are educated in the government system. Some non-government schools, I am told, accept special needs children if they already have siblings at the school and their parents are in a position to make a financial contribution. Other parents with strong religious beliefs are unable to place their child in a school that would inculcate these values. In the government system, they are continually under pressure from departments to put their children into underresourced special schools or to withdraw them altogether from schooling.</para><para>I am hearing of children who travel far more than they should because education departments will not inject funds to make schools, especially in rural areas, wheelchair accessible, for instance, at least not without a fight for which the parents have no time or energy in most cases. In northern Queensland, one child has been told he can attend school only two hours a week because that is the total time available for him to be assisted by an integration aid. Children with autism spectrum disorder displaying challenging behaviour are not getting the supervision they need or that their classmates need in order for their education not to be disrupted. Many of these children are intellectually quite advanced and are not suited to the curriculum at a special school. I have heard of one 14-year-old who has not attended school in three years because there is no money for a professional to be brought in to manage his behaviour. Another child has had his aid completely removed and is at home full time.</para><para>As I travel around speaking with parents of children with disabilities, these stories keep being brought up. It is clear that neither state nor federal governments have addressed this problem with any seriousness. When you contrast the circumstances of such children with the resources available to students in schools which are so generously taken care of by this legislation, we can see pretty stark differences in terms of the priorities of this government. The Democrats will not support the government's motion. We think this is not ideal but it is an amendment which we did support at the time, and we will continue to support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>19925</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens will not be supporting the government motion.

That is not what we should be standing for. I do not expect anything different from this government.

That is not how it works at all. Many people want to send their children to schools which have a greater income and greater wealth. That is a matter for them to pay for, to do so. To deprive public schools, under the formula that we have before us in this legislation, whereby four times as much will go to a student going into a private school as goes to a student going into a public school, is simply not on as far as the Greens are concerned.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While that argument has been addressed time and time again in here, what concerns me is the outcome we are facing in the next seven days. I am very concerned that the government is going to get its way because the Labor Party is going to allow the government to have its way. That is the problem. I do not accept this view that it can be left to the ballot box. The ballot box put us in here to act on behalf of the constituency that we now represent and not to try to find some electoral favour out of allowing the government to do the wrong thing by that constituency. It is our job to stand up for the constituency that put us here. It is my job as a Green to do that, and it is the Democrats' job and the Labor Party's job. If we work together for the majority of people who voted, for the constituency on this side of the chamber, we will rectify the wrong that is in this legislation. But if the Labor Party does as it has indicated publicly and in the end says, `Oh, well, the government can have its way,' that will actually serve against the interests of the Labor Party constituency.  </para><para>Let us make no mistake about this. Let us have this abundantly clear. Whether the government gets away with this or not is up to the Labor Party. The Labor Party has to change tack. At the moment it is simply going through political motions which have the end result of the formula of Minister Kemp being implemented. That does not have to happen. This Senate has equal powers. This Senate is able to say, `Here's a different formula for next year.' This Senate is able to stare the government down as much as it is able to stare us down. This government cannot and will not allow schools to go without funding next year. We know that. But it takes a bit of political gumption to make sure that we stand up for what we believe in, and the Labor Party should have to make the stand as well. I think the electorate is expecting the Labor Party to make sure that it has some points of differentiation from the government in an election year, not by making promises about what it might do further down line but by what it does in this term of office. Here is the opportunity for the Labor Party to show how different it is from the government: that it has not lost equality as a staple part of its philosophy, that it does stand up for the public school system which the majority of Australian children attend, that it is able to use political clout for the right policy when the opportunity arises, that it is not in the Senate to just make idealistic sounding speeches but is actually prepared to use its vote to stand up against the iniquity of this bill. </para><para>I am going to stand with Labor and the Democrats as far as this motion is concerned; that is, reject the government bouncing back to us the amendment which Labor proposed. But is Labor going to stand firm on that? We have amendments coming down the line next. What we are dealing with now is a request to the government in the House of Representatives to change the funding formula. The government has said no. It has come back here to the Senate and has said no. The public needs to understand that the very hard-edge amendments to the legislation are coming next. If we read what is right in front of our faces, the government is going to say no to those amendments when they go to the House of Representatives. That is when we will be put to the test. That is when we have to stand firm. That is when the Labor Party is going to be tested in here. If it stands firm with the Greens and the Democrats the right thing will be done by the education system. If it does not, then the wrong thing will be done and Labor will go to the next election saying, `But if we are in power we will do the right thing.' Labor is in power now in the Senate. We have the numbers to stand up for the public school system. We are tested now. Putting it off to some other day will not help the public school system. I want to make it abundantly clear that, while the issue has been canvassed and we know that the wrong thing is being done by the government, the real test in here in the coming days is going to be the fibre of the opposition in standing up for this important principle in which it believes. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>19926</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue before the Senate at the moment is the government's response to the Senate's requests with respect to the <inline ref="R1128">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000</inline>. It is quite clear that there are growing numbers of Australians who are deeply distressed and highly offended by what this government is doing and by the policies that this government is presenting with regard to its unequal and divisive funding of elite schools in this country. Therefore, I suggest the attention ought be on the government as to the direction of funding of schools. This is a government bill, after all. Senator Brown made some comments as to what the Labor Party's responsibilities are in this chamber. I do not think it can be seriously and properly argued that the Labor Party does not take its responsibilities extremely seriously. I do not believe it can be reasonably put that Labor senators have not considered this bill very carefully and measured its claims against the realities very thoroughly. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown, I appreciate your interest in these matters, but I am sure you would have noticed, through the Senate estimates processes and the Senate legislation committee processes, just how much attention has been paid to this bill by Labor Party senators. In fact, I put it to you, Senator Brown, that, if it had not been for the activities of the Labor Party on these issues, the public would not know what this government's proposals were really all about. I would suggest to you, Senator Brown, that the public is outraged by what is happening because they now understand, and it is more broadly appreciated, what this government is all about. I must say, Senator Brown, that I did not see you at any of those committees. I understand that you are very busy in other areas, but it is important to appreciate just what work is undertaken. </para><para>Labor bring a different philosophy from that of the Greens and the Democrats to the operations of the Senate. We are an alternative government; we are not purely a Senate party. In that context, we do not claim to run government from the opposition benches in the Senate, and we never have. Money bills are initiated by the government. We respond to them, and we make suggestions and requests to the government to amend its bill. We are deadly serious about that, Senator Brown. It is important to appreciate just how this has developed. The government announced its funding system 18 months before it introduced the bill. It tried to keep the bill under wraps. It is effectively trying to hold Australia's children to ransom. In the few weeks left before funding runs out under the old legislation, the government has suggested that we must pass the bill here and now and as quickly as possible. Frankly, we will not fall into the government's trap.</para><para>We say that we do not believe that children should be used as political pawns, as they are by this government. To the government—and this is what this motion will do if we defeat the government's proposition—we say that we want to give it another opportunity to reconsider its position because, frankly, the government's position must be reconsidered. In our judgment, it should accept our requests and amendments. After all, it is a $22 billion bill. It provides funding for all children at schools in this country. It has to be seen in that context. There is no rational reason why the government should reject the request for the amendments to be made through this process.</para><para>The government claims that the non-government funding is fair, simple and transparent. We have said, and we will keep saying, that that is simply untrue. It is far from fair. It gives the biggest increases to the richest schools—the ones with the Olympic swimming pools, the dozens of hockey courts, the many ovals, the luxurious gymnasiums and the lavish libraries. Those are the schools that can afford the lavish trips to France, the new ceramic centres and the equestrian centres. Those are the sorts of education communities that this government thinks are entitled to millions more dollars. At the same time, the government is saying to the poorest non-government schools that there is very little extra funding for them in this bill, and next to nothing for government schools, over and above the normal indexation arrangements.</para><para>The government also says the system is supposed to be more simple. Under Labor, there were 12 funding categories. Under this, there are 65. Less than 20 per cent of the school system is funded under this new model. If the system is so fair, why is it that 80 per cent are outside of it? That is the fact of the matter. The Catholic education system—65 per cent of the system—is opting out and about 15 per cent of schools will have their funding maintained. What you have, therefore, is a system that does not actually apply to most schools. However, the fact remains that this bill covers the funding arrangements for all schools in the coming four years.</para><para>We have pointed to numerous examples of how unfair the system is. It is clearly not objective. The situation in the Australian Capital Territory was covered in the last estimates. There are 38 non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory, and only one, Canberra Boys Grammar School, will get an increase. The rest are funding maintained. It demonstrates that the Australian Capital Territory socially does not mix very well with this model. Canberra's suburbs have developed quite deliberately—quite rightly in my opinion—to be mixed class suburbs. You do not have the concentrations of deprivation in the same way you do in other parts of the country. That is not to say that Canberrans are necessarily significantly better off than people in the rest of the country; it is just that deliberate policies have been taken to spread out social advantage, and people from different backgrounds live close by one another. This model will not pick up the disparities in wealth so, quite clearly, it does not fit with the social circumstances of a place like Canberra. </para><para>We have been told that this is a more transparent model—but it does not really apply in a case such as Canberra. Senator Brown rightly asked what we are going to do about it. We are going to press these requests. We are going to press these amendments. We are also making a few commitments. Senator Brown asked what the differential on this issue is between the parties looking to govern this country. We say that Labor's approach has been spelt out very clearly. We are determined to press these amendments, and we will wait and see what the government's response is. The pressure ought to be on the government. Senator Brown, you ought to be saying to people, `If you want these changes, go to the government. Seek the government's agreement to these changes.' That is where the action is in terms of the initiative in these particular matters.</para><para>Mr Kim Beazley outlined Labor's position in the House last night. He said that we want to see a fairer funding system. He said that one of the first acts of a Beazley Labor government will be to redirect the money currently going to the category 1 schools to other areas of greater need. We will abolish the EBA and we will return the $30 million taken from government schools. We are going to reverse the Howard government's bias against government schools and turn around the trend, which is growing so rapidly, of the Commonwealth share of funding going to non-government schools. </para><para>Senator Brown, I accept what you said: people are very angry. I say to Senator Ellison: government members know, too, how angry people are. They too are getting the phone calls and the emails that all our offices have been inundated with. I am sure they are having trouble responding to the correspondence and the emails protesting about this bill. They know that this is very damaging for the government electorally. </para><para>The Labor Party is particularly angry with the government. Senator Brown, I would ask you to think about that for a moment. Where should your anger be directed? It should be directed at the people who initiated this callous, unjust and divisive policy. Attention ought to go back onto the government. For those who are concerned and say that we should stop the bill right here and now, think for a moment of the consequences, and turn to the people who are responsible for the policies that are being pursued. As far as we are concerned, we have an obligation to pursue a mature approach to school funding—one that is suited to our society and to the real needs of our communities. We ought to be funding schools on the basis of real need. We ought to be guaranteeing access for all to a decent, inclusive, excellent public education system. Therefore, we urge the Senate to agree to press these requests and call on the government to reconsider its unfair and discriminatory actions. We ask the government to agree to the 23 amendments that the Senate has passed and to the two requests that have been made. Quite clearly, those amendments have not been considered by this government up to this point. The government must do so.</para><para>The government ought to govern for all Australians, not just for the elite and the privileged few.

What I do not accept is the strategy from there on. Senator Carr has said that the opposition will be pursuing these issues at the government's peril and that the opposition is determined to press the amendments. But I do not hear in that sentence that the opposition is determined to accept nothing less than the amendments. The opposition says that I should be saying to people, `If you want these changes, go to the government.' I am not. I am saying, `If you want these changes, go to the opposition,' because the government is philosophically opposed to the majority of Australians who want the public school system to get a fair go. But the opposition is philosophically in favour of the public schools getting a fair go. The opposition has the power to stand up to the government on this matter, and that is where the test comes in. I am saying to the opposition, `You are the elected people to stand in defence of your policy and in defence of funding for public schools. And the time to do it is now.' </para></talk.start><para>I do not go along for a minute with this manufacturing of anger. Sure, there are going to be many voters out there who will be angry with the government if this legislation goes through. The opposition is therefore tactically able to say at the next election, `We are better on education. Give your votes to us and your anger will be assuaged.' But I wonder if you can dinkum say that to an electorate when the opposition—the opposition which is seeking government—has the power in the Senate to make that stand for education now and fails to do so. I do not want to see education ransomed by the ALP manufacturing, for a political advantage, an angry electorate which then puts it into office. What is first and foremost here is doing the right thing by education, not doing the right thing for a political manoeuvre to help get votes at the next election. This is the education of children, and I think the opposition's best tactic is to stand up for education. I think it will get a lot more votes through doing that than through manufacturing anger and failing to do so.</para><para>That said, we are in the position to give the government extra time, as the opposition said, to reconsider its position. But we know that the government is not going to. It has got an incentive to not change its position, because it is being told by Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition—and Mr Lee, the shadow education minister—that the opposition is not going to stand on this matter. That has let the government off the hook. The government knows that it has just got to wait out the Senate. On the eve of Christmas, this legislation will go through. The opposition is going to cave in and the public school system is going to lose out. I do not like the politics of that.

I feel that some generosity is required, because on this side we need to have the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens standing firm, not saying, `We can't pass these amendments or stand by them because the Senate shouldn't do that.' I might remind the Democrats that Senator Kernot, their former leader, pursued me hotly at the last elections in Tasmania because I would not commit myself to turning my back on Senate powers over money matters. I would not, and at one stage it looked as though I would lose election over it. But I was not going to sign on with the Democrats to a statement that said, `The Senate should forgo its constitutional powers on this matter.' If the people change those constitutional powers I will fall in line. But they have not done so, and so, as a Green, I stand here in defence of the public school system, knowing that those powers are there and knowing that we should be using them. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>19930</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Simply for the record, the government believes that the requests should not be pressed and that the bill we are dealing with that these requests relate to simplifies administrative arrangements for funding for students with disabilities. It removes the current arbitrary differences in funding for primary and secondary students and it removes the inequitable differences in allocations under current arrangements where the most disadvantaged non-government schools receive no additional funds for students with disabilities. The amendments require additional funding, which Labor proposes to obtain by taking out of the general recurrent grants for some non-government schools. The government cannot accept any amendment that will remove funding from schools. There is no cut in funding for students with disabilities in government secondary schools. State governments will receive the same amount of special education funding as they do now. The bill resolves the inequitable differences in allocations under the current arrangements for the most disadvantaged non-government schools that receive no additional funds for students with disabilities. Under the former ERI system, category 12 schools with students with a disability did not get one additional dollar. By providing a flat per capita rate to all schools, this bill will grant an extra $527 for each student in such non-government schools.</para></talk.start><para>The proposal in the legislation for the creation of a list of schools which were excluded from the SES funding arrangements could mean that, in future, other schools, not necessarily category 1 schools, could be added to this list with little or no justification. The opposition cannot stand behind these amendments on the basis that certain schools should be categorised according to a blatantly broken ERI system while others can access the new SES arrangements. The anomaly of the opposition's position is that former category 1 schools such as Mentone Grammar School in Victoria, with an SES score of 110, would have its funding frozen. However, former category 2 schools such as Meriden School in New South Wales, with an SES score of 110, would receive a $3 million increase. The Penbank School, a former category 6 school with an SES of 110, would receive an extra $418 per student in 2004.</para><para>We have here a situation where the government has outlined legislation that it believes provides a fairer form of funding. But, importantly, we do have a time problem with the passage of this legislation. I can say that, by pressing these requests, this legislation could be held up. We need to pass this legislation as soon as possible so that agreements can be put in place in relation to funding. The government has received an overwhelming amount of correspondence, communication and lobbying in relation to the passage of this bill—that it be passed.

These amendments have been carried by the House of Representatives and reflect the negotiations that have taken place between the government and the opposition. I must say that it gives me some pleasure to indicate to the chamber that there are occasions when we can reach agreement with the government on important issues—and this is one such agreement, which is especially important, given the topic that we are considering here. </para></talk.start><para>The educational wellbeing of indigenous students is something that all of us ought to be very concerned about. The need to improve outcomes for indigenous students is something I would argue could not be treated more seriously by this parliament. The facts of the matter are that indigenous students in this country are not being given the support that they deserve and, as a consequence, we are seeing across a whole range of indicators that indigenous students are doing far worse than other Australian students. To me that is a matter we have all got to face and have a responsibility for as Australians. It is not a situation in which one should seek political advantage. It is a collective responsibility and, as far as I am concerned, not something that ought to be used as political football in debate. We ought not to be playing politics with the future of indigenous students. I do not believe the opposition has—and, may I put on the record, to its credit, neither has the government. </para><para>The amendments agreed to go to the provision of information to the public and to the parliament on matters connected with indigenous education. The issue here has not been the quantum as such—which is another argument entirely—but about accountability. Our concern has been that there has not been sufficient accountability, particularly in the states, for the expenditure of Commonwealth moneys in this regard. During the examination of the bill in the second reading stage, we detailed our concerns about that, in particular the fact that some territories and state authorities have been taking a disproportionate share of moneys, allegedly for administrative purposes. On one occasion up to 48 per cent of Commonwealth money was allegedly for administrative purposes. Frankly, that is an outrage and has to be stopped. </para><para>Our amendments essentially go to the issue of requiring information about the nature of the agreements that have been struck between the Commonwealth government and the educational providers, and we are seeking to have those agreements published. That was the import of what we said to the government. They have acknowledged that and have agreed to those agreements being published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>. The second amendment requires an annual report to parliament providing information about the outcomes for indigenous students in compulsory and post-compulsory education and training. There was some concern in the government that this could best be done through the annual report on schooling. Clearly, this measure is inadequate because, while the 2000 year data will be available in that forum, the fact remains that the first report under this act will provide details in respect of 2001. Our concern is that the report on schooling has traditionally been very late and the information contained in it inadequate in terms of getting a clear picture. It is of course subject to agreement with the states, which in itself is an interesting process when it comes to accurately reporting on what is occurring within the systems. </para><para>We are seeking to ensure that the appropriations of money are appropriate and are spent appropriately—broken down by sector and state. The opposition has been concerned to ensure that there is meaningful information available to the parliament on the progress of indigenous students relative to other students' progress, that we acknowledge the special needs of indigenous students in that process and that, given our particular responsibilities as part of the reconciliation process, we ensure that members of this parliament do all they can to improve the education and training outcomes for indigenous people. </para><para>We believe there needs to be a process whereby the product of agreements between the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers is available in a manner that will provide that information. I am very concerned that any attempt to allow that to occur simply through the annual national report is fraught with difficulty, given that changes can be made to that report without reference to the Commonwealth parliament. We argue that the parliament and the people of this country need a separate source of information about how well the education and training system is actually meeting the needs of indigenous people. I am very pleased that the government has now been able to come to an agreement on the matter. While I appreciate there will be additional work for the department, I think the long-term product of that process will be an opportunity to discuss issues and to hold people accountable for the spending of moneys in these vital areas. </para><para>I note that other matters dealt with in our original amendments are the subject of agreement for information to be provided through the Senate estimates process. I anticipate that the minister will be able to make a statement on that matter and I look forward to that. The bill as it is amended is, in my judgment, strengthened in a number of quite important ways. It will result in a much clearer picture of the state of play in educational terms for indigenous students. It will enable us as members of this parliament and through us the public at large to see just how well we are doing by indigenous people in regard to the provision of education and training. It will assist us in deciding how to move forward together with the indigenous communities and to ensure that there is a serious contribution to the reconciliation process through actually improving the lives of indigenous people in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>19932</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can confirm the comments of the opposition in relation to the negotiation that has gone on between the government and the opposition.

I echo the sentiments of Senator Carr in relation to what I think is generally a feeling across the political spectrum that indigenous education merits serious attention and is a challenge which faces all concerned for the future. The amendments that we have here are, first, providing for the gazettal of details of agreements made with education providers and, second, providing for the tabling of an annual report containing certain financial and performance information. Whilst the subject matter of the amendments does not go necessarily to the programs themselves in relation to indigenous education, they deal with an important aspect of accountability. </para></talk.start><para>In addition to these amendments, the government will endeavour to provide members with access to draft indigenous education agreements, finalised agreements upon request, and details of where funding has been reduced to an education provider except where the reduction was due to normal parameter changes such as a decrease in enrolments or finalisation of a one-off project. That echoes the statement made by the minister for education, Dr Kemp, in the other place and places on record the government's undertaking in relation to the requests made by the opposition. I commend to the Senate the legislation which is the subject of these amendments.

There is of course an argument which has not been resolved about the way in which this calculation is made; but, while there may be an argument about the formula for allocating payments or whether all South Australian dairy farmers are being treated equally, there should be no argument about the right of dairy farmers to test their case through the proper appeal processes. That is the problem that we are trying to deal with today—an amendment tabled by the minister subsequent to the original passing of the legislation now prevents those dairy farmers progressing, or at least makes it much more difficult for them to progress, their appeal. It seems to me that this is a very arbitrary and unfair tactic by the government to prevent such an appeal taking place. I am arguing that, whether or not the issue itself is one that we can agree on, surely we can agree on the right of these dairy farmers to have access to a proper appeal process and not to have that access hindered by an amendment tabled in this way by the government.</para><para>I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to the debate in this place which was conducted some months ago, during the original tabling of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program itself. The parliamentary secretary will remember that that legislation was introduced at the very last possible moment and that we could not debate the legislation itself at any great length or properly. I recall in the middle of the debate being interrupted by the Liberal whip and told to hurry up because, unless we finished the debate by a particular hour of the day on which the debate was being conducted, we would lose the opportunity. I remind the parliamentary secretary of that and of the assurances that were given at the time about a number of outstanding issues about which, if I recall correctly, Senator Len Harris, Labor itself and the Democrats had concerns. There were assurances given by the parliamentary secretary at the time that there would be an appeal process which would deal with these outstanding issues. </para><para>That is why I am concerned about what has happened subsequent to the debate, which was very truncated, and was cut off, I believe, with the cooperation of all parties in this chamber. We believed that there would be a subsequent opportunity for those who had outstanding grievances to have the grievances addressed. That is why I believe the amendments which were subsequently moved as an order—not through an amending bill, but as an order by the minister—are both unfair and unjust. They make it very difficult for dairy farmers who have these outstanding issues to progress their appeals through the proper tribunals.</para><para>In speaking to this disallowance motion, I note that there is different numbering in the motion to the original legislation. I intend to refer to the numbering in the original legislation, but I can assure the Senate that the numbers, although different, do correspond. I want to deal with the issue of whether or not dairy farmers in south-east South Australia have been treated equitably as well as with the issue of whether they have an ability to progress their appeal. I do not believe they have. I must apologise to the chamber that some of what I am going to say is quite technical, but it is the only way we can put down in the chamber the technical aspect of the debate. I want to argue that those farmers have been treated inequitably. In doing this, I give thanks to Ron Purvis and other farmers who have kept me very much informed on this issue, and also to Tim Hall, the lawyer for the farmers, who provided very helpful briefings over the last few weeks. </para><para>I turn to the issue itself. I want to put down some of the reasons why I believe these farmers should be allowed to progress their appeal. The Dairy Structural Adjustment Program scheme was formulated pursuant to section 10 of the Dairy Industry Adjustment Act 2000. The Dairy Structural Adjustment Program Scheme Amendment 2000 (No. 3) was introduced by the Hon. Warren Truss, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, acting under sections 10 and 35 of the act. Amendment No. 3 varied the scheme by introducing subsection (3A) in section 30 of the scheme. </para><para>The purported effect of subsection (3A) was to exclude, for the purposes of subsection (3) of section 30, market milk deliveries not covered by state pooling arrangements pursuant to the South Australian milk marketing and equalisation agreement. Section 30 of the scheme is headed `Abnormal Milk Market Pool Distributions' and applies where one or more dairy farm enterprises in a jurisdiction did not receive payment at the market milk rate for the same proportion of their milk deliveries as other dairy farm enterprises. This is the crux of the debate—that there is an inequitable distribution of payments from the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program depending on which particular farm you are on in an area.</para><para>It is generally accepted that section 30 applies to South Australia as a pooling jurisdiction. Subsection (3) provides that, if section 30 applies, the Dairy Adjustment Authority must determine for each dairy farm enterprise in relation to which claims for payment rights have been received the amount of market milk and manufacturing milk that the enterprise would have delivered if it had received payment at the market milk and manufacturing milk rates for the same portion of its eligible milk deliveries during the base year as other dairy farm enterprises in the jurisdiction. That is a very technical way of saying that there is a difference between dairy farms in this area depending on where their particular milk was delivered to, even though people may be living side by side. Dairy farmers located in the south-east region of South Australia have been advised that their proportion of market milk was 19 per cent, whereas other dairy farmers in South Australia were advised that their proportion of market milk was 29 to 32 per cent. This is where the inequity has come about.</para><para>The anomaly arose out of differences in the definition of market milk for the purposes of the scheme and the South Australian equalisation. The difference concerns UHT and flavoured milk on which DMS levies were paid pursuant to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act. UHT and flavoured milk on which DMS levy was paid was treated as manufacturing milk and paid for as a percentage of the market milk price. The fundamental premise on which this anomaly is sought to be justified is an incorrect assumption that a dairy farm enterprise which paid, or had paid on its behalf, a DMS levy on UHT and flavoured milk received higher payments for that milk, for which greater adjustment was required. Comparative figures between all South Australian dairy farmers clearly show that this was not the case and that, notwithstanding DMS levies or payments, all dairy farm enterprises in South Australia were receiving similar net returns for total milk supplied. </para><para>It is the south-east dairy farmers who have lost the benefits of the South Australian equalisation who will suffer to a greater extent than other South Australian dairy farmers following deregulation of the Australian dairy industry. Following complaints by dairy farmers based in the south-east of South Australia to the DAA and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the minister, presumably on advice from his department, introduced subsection (3A) as part of amendment (3). It would appear that the effect of subsection (3A) is to remove UHT and flavoured milk from consideration by DAA in making a determination pursuant to section 30 and hence the opportunity for south-east dairy farmers to seek a determination by DAA pursuant to section 30 of the scheme. As an administrative function, any such determination by DAA would have been capable of further review by appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. What the amendment does is make it much more difficult for farmers to use that section of the act to pursue their appeal for a judgment under the section. </para><para>There are a whole lot of issues that could be dealt with. Some of the objectors to the disallowance motion, particularly in the industry itself, have said that this will open the floodgates on many other issues. But, despite requests for details of what these issues are, south-east dairy farmers have not had any reply to their questions about what such issues might be. In terms of whether this is a federal or a state issue, it has been suggested that this matter is a state based issue and should not be dealt with at a federal level. Unfortunately, the amendment to the legislation and the original legislation are federal matters. That is why we are seeking to remove the obstruction which now exists at a federal level. </para><para>I understand that farmers in Western Australia, who have had a similar problem, were able to resolve this matter through the Western Australian government, but that is not now open to farmers in the south-east of South Australia. In any event, irrespective of how the dairy adjustment package is distributed amongst South Australian dairy farmers, the amount available under the scheme remains the same—that is, at 29 per cent of the market milk share. The net effect of the anomaly is that south-east dairy farmers will receive a decrease in the market milk share from 29 per cent to 19 per cent, and other South Australian dairy farmers will receive an increase from 29 per cent to 32 per cent. Because the market milk share is lower, that means that their total payment from the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program scheme will also be lower. If section 30 were applied on equitable terms based on the identified effects of deregulation, the same pool of funds would be available for distribution amongst South Australian dairy farmers. Accordingly, whilst it is arguably a state based issue, it can be resolved by determination by the DAA, between South Australian dairy farmers and pursuant to section 30 without any effect on the adjustment package under the scheme or on any other dairy farmer in Australia.</para><para>In summary, the fundamental premise that dairy farmers who paid the DMS levy must have been receiving higher prices for such milk rather than justifying higher payments under the DSAP scheme is unsustainable and not supported by the facts. Amendment (3) is an inappropriate use of a minister's legislative power in that it effectively limits the ability of the DAA to make a determination under section 30 of the scheme and removes any right to seek a judicial review of such a decision. Despite submissions to the contrary, the disallowance of subsection (3A) will have little or no effect on the balance of the scheme or on other dairy farmers outside South Australia.</para><para>To finish, let me give you one example. One supplier received, in the base year—that is, in 1998-99—75 per cent of the farm gate price for UHT milk. In other words, the farm gate price was 51c a litre and three-quarters of that is 38c per litre. But in the package that farmer now receives 46.23c a litre for market milk—that is, 8.23c a litre more than they ever received for that portion of milk in their monthly payments. The government is not only returning their levy but handing them a bonus. For the equivalent percentage of milk, two-thirds of the south-east suppliers have been advised that they are to receive 8.96c a litre—that is, 37.27c a litre less than they should have received.</para><para>That is the issue. The appeal that I make is that this particular disallowance be supported so that the amendment which was made by the minister in an order of the parliament can be struck down. That will allow these particular farmers to pursue their case and to put it before appropriate tribunals such as the DAA and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Then we can test, in an independent way, whether or not what they claim as inequitable treatment is true or not. That is the only way to resolve this issue, not by an amendment which takes away their ability to pursue that appeal in a proper way. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>19936</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I should make a few comments in respect of the opposition's position. We will not be supporting this disallowance motion from Senator Woodley, which relates to the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. Senator Woodley indicated that the matter is a complex one, and I think anybody who has listened to the debate, whether on a broadcast or indeed in this building, would recognise that fact from the detail that Senator Woodley went through. Those of us who are members of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee and who participated in the long inquiry and debate surrounding deregulation in the milk industry recognise, firstly, that there are some complexities and, secondly, that inevitably some problems are going to arise. </para></talk.start><para>I think a few points need to be made. I apologise in advance if I am going to make it sound a bit more complex than even Senator Woodley did. Firstly, under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program farmers are paid 46.23c for every litre of market milk and 8.98c for every litre of manufacturing milk delivered in 1998-99, that year being the base year for the scheme. Because of the differing arrangements which operated in each state regarding such things as, in some areas, quotas and pooling, it was necessary to find a common method for determining what is to be regarded as market milk and what is to be treated as manufacturing milk for the purposes of calculating the specific entitlement or payment under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. The definitions that were adopted for the program were those used for the Commonwealth Domestic Market Support Scheme. Therefore, milk which attracted a DMS levy of 1.9c a litre is considered market milk and milk which attracted a DMS payment to the producer is considered manufacturing milk. </para><para>As we apprehend it, the problem that has been referred to in Senator Woodley's case is because South Australian governments previously never formally included UHT and flavoured milk within the market milk pool. Most South Australian dairy farmers—there are currently around 600—will receive payments under the DSAP on the basis that they supplied milk to the market milk pool, and the figure of 19 per cent is applicable there, plus milk for UHT and flavoured milk, around 13 per cent. Thus their entitlement under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, DSAP, is calculated on the basis of 19 per cent plus 13 per cent, a total of 32 per cent. It is that 32 per cent which will attract the higher rate. </para><para>Some farmers, and these are the farmers that Senator Woodley has referred to, in the south-eastern region of the state—there are about 80 of them, I understand—will receive the DSAP payment at the higher rate on 19 per cent of the milk they supplied. This comes about, we are advised, because milk supplied by South Australian producers to South Australian processors which was ultimately used to produce UHT and flavoured milk attracted a Commonwealth DMS levy, and so for the purposes of the DSAP it is treated as market milk. What is significant about the 80 farmers in the south-east of South Australia is that they supplied milk to the Victorian processors. Those farmers paid a DMS levy on only seven per cent of milk delivered and received a DMS payment on the rest.</para><para>If this disallowance motion were to succeed, DSAP payments for all South Australian dairy farming families would be reduced and further delays in payments would occur. We are already conscious of the fact that there are many dairy farmers still awaiting their first payment. That was advised to the estimates committee only last week. Further, the 80 farmers in the south-east—those that had a different calculation applied because of the fact that they were supplying milk to the Victorian processors—would not necessarily have their entitlements increased but other farmers certainly would see theirs fall. We are advised that the south-eastern farmers that Senator Woodley is speaking on behalf of are being treated the same as others who supplied the Victorian market. Senator Woodley also referred to the situation in Western Australia. We are advised further that, when a similar anomaly arose in that state, the Western Australian government acknowledged that it was a state problem and provided the appropriate compensation. </para><para>Finally, we indicate that the advice to the opposition is that none of the dairy industry organisations, particularly in South Australia, support this disallowance motion. As this scheme was ultimately one driven by industry, and that was an important factor in the decisions taken by the committee and subsequently the parliament in supporting the legislation, we are unable, for that reason and each of the other reasons I have detailed, to support this disallowance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>19937</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government obviously will not be supporting Senator Woodley's motion to disallow item 19 of schedule 1 of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program Scheme Amendment 2000 (No. 3). There are a couple comments I would like to make on Senator Woodley's remarks. Firstly, I cannot imagine how Senator Woodley imagines that the appeal rights of dairy farmers have become affected since the passage of the legislation. The appeal rights of dairy farmers to the Dairy Adjustment Authority are totally unaffected, and under section 49 all dairy farmers have the right to have their decisions reconsidered and reviewed by the Dairy Adjustment Authority and then by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendment does not affect that right.</para></talk.start><para>I will not go over section 49, but it remains the same. An entity who is affected under the scheme may, by notice given to the Dairy Adjustment Authority within 28 days after the decision comes to its attention, ask the Dairy Adjustment Authority to reconsider its decision. A request is taken to be a request under that subsection for reconsideration of all the decisions that involved or depended on the allocation of those components. A request must set out the reasons for making the request and, if the Dairy Adjustment Authority receives that request, it must reconsider each decision to which the request relates as soon as practicable after receiving the request. It may confirm the decision, it may revoke the decision or it may vary the decision in whatever way the authority thinks fit. Senator Woodley, nothing has changed. Indeed, for a moment, when I heard your opening remarks, I began to think that perhaps I was in the wrong debate and that this was part of your disallowance motion that had not been really considered by anyone. So I assure you that the appeal rights of dairy farmers are unaffected and that they have not changed since that part of the legislation was put through the Senate earlier this year.</para><para>I would also echo Senator Forshaw's remarks that, if the Western Australian government can deal with the special circumstances of Western Australian farmers, then indeed the South Australian government should also be able to take similar action, and state governments do have that facility if they so consider it. Also, the government has not heard from any of the dairy industry organisations on this matter. The industry organisations are excellent at representing their constituents and I can assure you that, if this were an issue, they would have made a case for putting this matter before us. That has not happened.</para><para>Under the regulations and the bill that was passed earlier this year in the Senate, these farmers are being treated in the same way as all other dairy farmers in Australia. Their entitlements are determined on the basis of 1998-99 milk deliveries payable at the considered rates, and the definitions of marketing and manufacturing milk were based on the former Domestic Market Support Scheme. Again, as has been pointed out, under those definitions those deliveries on which the Domestic Market Support levy was paid will attract a market milk entitlement, while those deliveries on which a DMS payment was received will attract a manufacturing milk entitlement.</para><para>The claims by the south-east South Australian producers that those definitions used for market and manufacturing milk do not take into account their particular state based circumstances relate essentially to their treatment under the previous state arrangements. Those producers, as has been remarked, supplied milk to processors in Victoria and did not have access to the UHT and flavoured milk market in South Australia. Their perceived disadvantage relates to the way that their businesses operated under South Australian state government pool arrangements, not the Commonwealth package. The Commonwealth government is not able to address these concerns because to do so would be inconsistent with the basic rationale of the package—that is, to provide higher payments to producers of market milk who face by far the greatest adjustment pressure from deregulation. </para><para>The South Australian farmers argue—incorrectly—that section 30 as originally drafted provided them with a mechanism to achieve a higher proportion of market milk entitlements under the DSAP scheme. The purpose of section 30 is to ensure that anyone participating in a market milk pool has the same proportional access to the market milk entitlement of the DSAP as their fellow participants. Section 30 does not—I repeat, does not—apply to market milk deliveries that are outside a state pooling arrangement. In that case, those are the deliveries of UHT and flavoured milk. Section 30 is to address situations where actual market milk sales were at variance with the allocated pool percentages. So this difference in entitlements is not inconsistent, nor is it inequitable, and it does not reflect an anomaly.</para><para>The advice provided by the Australian Government Solicitor indicated that an amendment to section 30 was necessary to correct a drafting error whereby all South Australian producers would have been excluded from higher payment entitlements than those accrued from UHT and flavoured milk deliveries outside the pooling arrangement but on which they paid DMS levy and for which they should therefore have been entitled to the market milk benefit under the package. The changes to section 30 were incorporated into the instrument, the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program Scheme Amendment 2000 (No. 3), tabled on 28 August 2000. Senator Woodley, I hope you are listening to this.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—I am taking note, Parliamentary Secretary.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name></talker><para>—In relation to the entitlements of South Australian farmers, the Australian Government Solicitor's advice indicates that a successful disallowance would mean that all South Australian farmers would receive a lower entitlement. Farmers from around 80 south-east South Australian farms would not have their entitlements to market milk shares increased but farmers from around 600 other South Australian dairy farms would suffer a reduction in entitlements from 32 per cent to 19 per cent. As well, we should also take into account that the disallowance of the amended section is likely to create serious inequities in entitlements and delays in payment within South Australia because claims processed prior to disallowance will be assessed under criteria different from those processed after disallowance. The government will not be supporting this motion and I am very pleased that apparently the opposition will not be supporting it either.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>19938</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a few brief comments in relation to this matter. One of the most telling comments that the minister has made is that the passage of this motion to disallow regulations would further delay payments under this scheme to dairy farmers around the country. The appallingly slow process of processing claims, approving them and paying money—in which we see that only about 9,000 out of about 29,000 producers who would have an entitlement under this scheme have been paid, in a timetable which is going a long way beyond that which the government suggested it could meet—indicates that any further delays in making payments are unacceptable. That is even more clearly seen to be the case when one looks at the potential impact of the acceptance of this disallowance. I am advised that, for 600 of the approximately 680 dairy farms in South Australia with an entitlement under the scheme, the impact would be to reduce payments of the higher amount for market milk from approximately 29 to 32 per cent of their production down to 19 per cent of their production. There really has been a terrible delay in processing payments, which has to be sheeted home to the fact that this government was so tardy in proceeding towards addressing the needs of this industry and the wishes of the industry leaders. It is because of that that we are now faced with a proposition which is totally untenable. </para></talk.start><para>As to the 80 producers, I will not go into the specific arrangements in South Australia—they are complex and Senator Woodley, Senator Forshaw and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Troeth, addressed those issues before I did. But one telling point is that, under the previous Domestic Market Support Scheme arrangements, the dairy farmers paid a levy on milk supplied as market milk and received payments from the Domestic Market Support Scheme in relation to the remainder. In Victoria that proportion was seven per cent where payments were made, obviously averaging 93 per cent in return. The situation in South Australia is about a 30-70 split. But these particular farmers were effectively operating in circumstances somewhat akin to those of the farmers across the border in Victoria supplying milk to Victorian processors. What they are apparently asking of Senator Woodley, and what the intent is behind this disallowance motion, is that they not be treated in the same way as those Victorian farmers but that they be treated in some other way so that they get the best of both worlds and get the higher percentage payments on a proportion of the milk on which they did not make DMS payments. In other words, they want the best of both worlds. Having avoided making DMS payments on a higher proportion of their milk, they want to now get the higher adjustment payment on that higher proportion of milk. That seems to me to be more inequitable than the situation suggested by Senator Woodley.</para><para>Coupling those factors—the inequity of the comparison of the DMS versus the DAA scheme in relation to these people; that is, that they want it both ways—with the effect that the disallowance would have on the remaining dairy farmers in South Australia, combined with the consequent delays which would be occasioned in processing this and with further disputation—which would be disastrous in terms of getting the money out to processors and letting them get on with whatever they intend to do with the money to adjust their enterprises—it would be unconscionable for the Senate to support the disallowance motion put forward by Senator Woodley. I accept that Senator Woodley approaches this matter with good intentions, but I think that on reflection he would, in dealing with this matter, reasonably come to the view that it is not such a bad thing that this disallowance motion is not going to get up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>19939</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a few very brief comments to make. I agree with Senator O'Brien and particularly with his statement about the disastrous slowness of the payments. That has really been quite a scandal, and I think it needs to be addressed in another debate at some time. Really, the arguments are not so much between us but between lawyers. The legal advice that I have received—obviously through the south-east South Australian farmers—is that this disallowance would not affect other farmers and need not affect other farmers. If it did, then it would be possible for the government to bring subsequent amendments which would solve that problem. The advice I have got is contrary to what the government and the opposition are saying, but at the end of the day I guess that it is simply a legal debate between lawyers and I do not think we can resolve it here. </para></talk.start><para>One of the issues that the south-east South Australian farmers brought to my attention is that, if you compare payments over a number of years between farmers in South Australia, you will find that the average payments were exactly the same. Whether we are talking about the farmers in south-east South Australia or whether we are talking about other dairy farmers in South Australia, the average payments over a period of time were exactly the same. There was, at that point, equity between them, but certainly the payments from the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program are not the same, and that is where the inequity occurs. I understand the debate we are having and I understand how the numbers are, so I will not delay the Senate any longer. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>19940</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to provide the Senate with information that appeared in a recent press release and to answer Senator O'Brien.

It will require the secretary to the department to establish a national panel of people with the necessary experience and background to be administrators or advisers. I am advised by the department that something similar operates on an informal basis. This has certainly been sought widely in the industry as being a worthwhile development. When a provider is required to appoint an administrator or adviser by the department as a result of sanctions, they will be given a list of the approved administrators or advisers to choose from. Under our proposal, they would then have two days to identify a person on the relevant list who is immediately available to act as either an administrator or an adviser and then one further day to appoint that person. Our amendment also attempts to better define the role and powers of administrators and advisers, who currently have no powers under the Aged Care Act. This amendment arises out of our concern about the way departmental and ministerial interventions into substandard nursing homes have been occurring. We have been concerned that the concentration seems to have been on the question of financial sanctions against the provider as a means of bringing their behaviour into line, but that does not necessarily deal immediately with the question of the care of residents at that nursing home. </para><para>Our main concern, as I expressed in the second reading debate last night, is to ensure that, when a problem is notified, residents immediately receive proper care. If the agency or anyone else has found that the residents of a nursing home are at severe risk to their health, then clearly the priority for the minister, the department and the parliament is to ensure that proper care is provided—that they are removed from that risk—by someone in whom the minister and the department have faith to provide that care. That is why we are moving this amendment today.</para><para>I am pleased to see that the government are moving amendments to our amendment which seem to be accepting that principle. I am pleased about that. My intention is to get the best possible result, to provide the aged care minister with the power to make proper interventions and to protect residents. It is a job I hope to have one day, so I am very keen to make sure that the minister has those powers and is not left without the wherewithal to protect residents. I am interested to hear what the government have to say about why they are making changes to our amendment. We will come to that debate, but my primary concern is to get the best possible provisions into the Aged Care Act and to empower the minister and the department to protect the residents. While I have no problem with sanctions against providers, I regard it as a secondary issue in the sense that, as it may take some time, one can fight with the provider almost at one's leisure, providing residents are being cared for in the meantime.</para><para>We do not think that, under the government's system, there is the power to ensure that an administrator or an adviser is appointed immediately after serious risks are identified—and a range of cases have proven that point in recent years. The current system takes too long to appoint administrators and advisers. Under the existing arrangements, the provider is given 14 days to nominate someone for a position, the secretary has 14 days to approve that nomination and another seven days to inform the provider of the decision, and the provider then has seven days to appoint the person—and that is a best case scenario. If the secretary refuses to approve the nominee, the provider can appeal that decision to the AAT. </para><para>For all that time the residents are left in the care of the provider who has proven to be not providing proper care and to be posing a serious risk to the health of those residents. That is just unacceptable. While there may be questions of process to be followed, we have to ensure that the care of those residents is immediately secured and that their best interests are immediately put at the centre of the system. Under this system we believe residents are left in substandard care while the provider and the department engage in this bureaucratic exchange. I think it is important to note that the current timetable for the appointment of an administrator or an adviser starts only when sanctions are imposed, which may well be some weeks after the serious risks to residents were first identified. In the case of Thames Street, the sanction to appoint an adviser was opposed more than six weeks after the serious risks were found. There may well be special reasons for that, but it again highlights the opposition's concerns.  </para><para>Under the current system, once an administrator or adviser has been appointed, they have no formal power to actually ensure that improvements are implemented. They must negotiate any changes in care with the provider, who may have a long record of noncompliance with the standards. Advisers and administrators have indicated to us the difficulties they face in the absence of any real power under the Aged Care Act. We want to make sure they can do their job properly. If we empower them to go in there to ensure the care of the residents, we must make sure they have the tools to do that job properly. Our amendment would effectively force the provider to recognise the right of an administrator to actually manage the day-to-day operations of the facilities. Under the current system it can be a minimum of three weeks before we are able to effectively provide proper care. With our amendment, we are proposing that we bring it down to three days. We think that is a much more acceptable timetable. We accept it might be used only in the most serious of cases, when the need arises, but we do want to make sure that the minister has the power to act quickly and to ensure care quickly.</para><para>I notice in the amendments circulated that the government is looking to push out those time frames again. I will be interested to hear what the minister has to say about that. My first reaction is that I am not convinced. I am going to want to be convinced as to why we ought to keep pushing out the time frames. I know there is always a good bureaucratic answer for taking longer—due process, appeal rights and all those sorts of things—but this is a situation where we are dealing with the minister's own department identifying serious risks to the health and care of elderly residents. It seems to me that we have to have the shortest possible timetable to make sure that their standard of care and their health are protected. I will need to be convinced that the government's amendments are not just allowing an unduly lengthy bureaucratic process which puts at risk those residents who may, in fact, have been at risk for some time. By the time you discover the problem and do the review audit, they may have already been at risk for some time. As I say, we want to argue for the shortest possible time frame. I will be interested to hear what the minister has to say when he speaks to his amendments. </para><para>I am pleased that there seems to be some willingness on the government's part to endorse the idea. We have been talking to the Democrats about endorsing this sort of approach. I know it is consistent with the sort of thing they have been talking about in terms of flying squads and a recognition more generally in aged care that we need to have a quicker response aimed particularly at providing care in the small number of nursing homes that are not providing care, not playing the game and not meeting the standards. Obviously the Democrats and the government will speak for themselves, but I just thought I would say that in passing. </para><para>I want to make it perfectly clear—Minister, I do not think you had entered the chamber when I first made these remarks—that, despite the occasional point scoring that goes on on these things, we are actually interested in making sure that we get the best possible result out of this bill. We are concerned to get the shortest possible timetable. I will be interested to hear your remarks. We want to get a bill that allows any minister to be effective in protecting the care of the residents. That is our prime concern. I do not care who owns the amendment, whether it is in the Democrats' name, our name or the government's name; I am just concerned that we get the best possible advice and powers for the minister and that we ensure that the Minister for Family and Community Services and any of her successors can do their job properly in this most important area. I understand there are Democrats and government amendments to our amendment. I am not sure at this stage which ones are being proceeded with, so I will perhaps speak on those amendments when the situation is clearer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—The question is that opposition amendment No. 1 be agreed to.

There are a number of things we wish to do. One is to include a medical practitioner on the advisory panel. The reason for this is that we believe there is the likelihood that sanctions being imposed on nursing homes will come about as a result of health related matters. In fact, we have already seen that in the Riverside situation. So if issues have been identified such that it is necessary to appoint an administrator or an adviser, we think it is likely that resident health matters have also been overlooked.</para><para>In a recent assessment of an aged care facility on which sanctions were imposed, it was noted that all residents had at least one undiagnosed medical condition. We do not accept that the health of residents can be placed at risk under any circumstances, so our amendment includes a medical practitioner or medical practitioners on the administration and adviser panels. That is based on our concern for residents. It is not envisaged that that medical practitioner would treat residents, as the choice of doctor remains that of the individual. However, a medical practitioner will be able to advise and direct appropriate referral where it is clear that the health of residents is affected. The opposition amendment as it now stands does not provide for a statement of reasons for the secretary to terminate a person's appointment to the panel.

My understanding of the current system is that an administrator or a nurse adviser is appointed to the home to provide care and to take over, in part, the role of the provider of making sure care is provided. The panel suggestion is that a group of people are available for that role, but it is not a suggestion that a group of people—a doctor, a nurse and an administrator—will do that. It is one person. While I do not have any trouble with the fact that one, two or others on the panel might well be doctors, the skills that we are generally looking for are either that of an administrator or a nurse adviser. I would be interested in Senator Herron's view on this. It is not as if we would be sending in three people, including a doctor. I do not have any great objection if a qualified doctor is on the list—that is fine—but my understanding of the proposition is different. Adding the doctor does not mean you add a doctor to the team; what you are doing is putting a doctor's name on a list from which one person will be selected. Therefore, I do not think it will meet the objectives that the Democrats have set out for it. If push comes to shove, I would vote for it because I do not think it does any harm, but I do not think it does what Senator Allison thinks it does. I may be wrong on that—I am happy to be corrected if I am—but I would be interested in the minister's view.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think we should leave the debate thinking that, by passing the amendment, we have added another person to the function. What we have done is to put a doctor's name on the list, who may or may not be chosen. Even if, as Senator Allison rightly said, there were severe medical issues, as there often are, about lack of treatment et cetera, I am not sure that you would put the doctor in; I think you would put the administrator in to make sure that proper medical attention was brought in as one of the resources. As I said, I am not really opposing it; I am seeking clarification. I do not think it achieves quite what Senator Allison thinks it will, but it is really up to the government to explain that position. I am interested in what Senator Herron has to say. I do not have any problem with putting the person on. Maybe I misunderstood, but my understanding is that it will not achieve the result that Senator Allison thinks it will achieve. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>19945</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure what Senator Evans thinks I assumed this meant.

Maybe the minister can provide some advice. As I understand it, the person on the panel has no function. There is a list of names—that is what the panel is—and they are only used if they are appointed as an administrator or a nurse adviser. The doctor obviously will not be appointed as a nurse adviser, so the question is whether they are appointed as an administrator. My understanding of how it works is that they have no role unless they are appointed as the administrator of the nursing home. The panel does not have any other wide consultation role—they either get appointed as the administrator, or they do not. That is where I think we may be at cross-purposes, but I may be wrong. I hope the minister can clarify this, because he does have the advantage of the best legal minds the health department can provide.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>19945</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My understanding is that it is an extra person, as the Democrats have said.

As I said earlier, the current arrangements are very lengthy, and I think the government found that in Riverside and other cases. Because of the 14-day and seven-day notifications and so on, it took a long time to get to the point they wanted to get to. Our amendments are directed at solving that problem. We came up with a proposition of two-day and one-day because of our concern about the need for urgency in providing care. We were saying, `We have got a 72-hour response versus a three-week response.' The government wants to push that out for eight days. I am the first to admit that there is no magic about my two and one, other than that they were, I thought, the shortest possible time frames we could go for. I do not understand why it now takes three days to appoint somebody. I never understood why it took seven; I do not understand why it takes three. The government, until today, was defending the 14 and seven timetables. They are now proposing five and three, refuting two and one. I just want to understand on what basis that is made, what the logic is. As I said, I am open to be persuaded but, from what the minister has said so far, I still do not understand that rationale. I think it is important that we understand why they can go from 14 to five but not from 14 to two, and why they can go from seven to three but not to one.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>19947</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand Senator Evans's concern that it appears that action would be taken immediately to revoke the approved provider under the present act so you do need to allow a reasonable time for appointments to be made. All of us would like to see the time shortened but, as I mentioned previously, while any time frame is arbitrary, a period of five working days is considered acceptable. As Senator Evans said, in principle it is much shorter than the current 14 days and longer than the proposal of two working days. Likewise, the one-day time limit for the provider to appoint the adviser or administrator, once approved, is just too short. As the actual appointment of a person to work for a provider will be subject to commercial terms, it will be necessary for providers and advisers to complete agreements or contracts, and they should be given a reasonable time to do this. It is thought that three working days is considered more appropriate. I think the essential and crucial point is that the provider status would be revoked under the present agreement.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>19947</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to indicate that we also thought that 14 days was too long a period in which to provide for the appointment of an administrator. We also thought that Labor's proposal of two days was too short a period. That is based on discussions we have had with various people in the industry. I think that five days is arbitrary, just as 14 is arbitrary. But there may be circumstances in which a panel member is decided upon and then there may be subsequent advice about a conflict of interest, or it may be a whole range of issues which might make turning the situation around in two days quite difficult. It was pointed out to me that, particularly in rural areas, finding an appropriate administrator might be a key difficulty and that would be a problem. I think the fact that a sanction comes to bear if this is not done within a two-day period means that it is incumbent on us to consider even those extraordinary situations where two days would be inadequate.</para></talk.start><para>For that reason, the Democrats will support the government amendments. They are a compromise, and I think they are, at the end of the day, quite a reasonable period. We would all hope that an appointment would be made in a very short time frame—and maybe two days will be the norm; however, there are some circumstances where we could imagine that two days would be unnecessarily tight. As I said, the implications of not meeting that appointment requirement within that time are very severe. For that reason, we think that five days is probably a lot better than 14 and that two would probably be problematic. As I have already indicated, we think that one day is adequate for the next phase to take place. We do not agree with the government's request that it be three working days, because that would add up to eight working days, which is very close to 14. So we think that five and one are appropriate periods of time. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>19948</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am disappointed. I do not think the case has been made out. I know that most of these things are arbitrary, and I accept that. But I think we have to ask whether, on balance, we are more concerned about the administrative processes or whether we are more concerned about the care. It seems to me that we are all more concerned about the care, but I think in the government's proposition we give too much consideration to the needs of the bureaucracy. Senator Allison, that is the point I am trying to make. In his answer the minister made the point about working days, but his key point about the loss of the provider status applies whenever we do it, whatever the time frame. I think that is right. If we are going to do what we are going to do, the end result for the provider is the same: it is the question of how long they have in between time. If that is not right, I would be happy to hear.</para></talk.start><para>The reason Labor initiated these amendments was to ensure that we move much more quickly to provide care. When the department and the agency have said there is a severe risk to the health of the residents, to then have this genteel debate about the needs of the bureaucracy and the needs of administrators takes the urgency out of it. There is often a delay from the time the department and the agency get to hear about the complaint. There is already a huge bureaucratic process going on before the agency actually does that risk assessment. I just do not see the need for us to have a lengthy delay. As Senator Allison quite rightly says, the government's proposal of coming back to eight working days is effectively 10 days time, including the intervening weekend. Again, I think that is too long for us to act on the question of the care of residents. We do know from recent history that there are a number of providers that have been totally recalcitrant. They are not interested in providing care. They are not interested in providing proper standards. They are not interested in playing the game. They are a very small minority but they have proved to be totally recalcitrant, and I am sure that departmental officers would testify to that. It seems to me that we need to move much more quickly.</para><para>Unless the minister has more to say on this, I am not convinced as to why we should go for the longer delay. I know the Democrats look like taking the middle road. If that is where the numbers fall, that is where the numbers fall. But I would urge them to think about the length of time involved and to make the priority in this our ability—the minister's and the department's—to get proper care to those residents. Quite frankly, I think the bureaucratic hitches that we have talked about are very unimportant in the scheme of things. The industry has certainly said to the minister and to us, to everybody, that it is prepared to make sure that the panel works, that the big providers, the good providers—and there are a whole range of people of goodwill in the industry—are prepared to put themselves forward to be there to assist in making this work. There is a lot of goodwill about that proposition, so I think that we could get enough people of goodwill on the list to make sure that we can overcome regional issues. I am just not convinced by what the minister has said so far that we should again go to an eight-day time frame which, in effect, will be 10 days. I think the argument for the urgent intervention is far stronger than some of these bureaucratic arguments in favour of a longer time frame.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>19948</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a bit unfair of Senator Evans to suggest that we are worrying about bureaucracy and not worrying about the care of residents. That is clearly a nonsense. We are interested in getting a smooth operation so that administration can be properly effected so that residents are protected. It is not going to protect any residents if a suitable panel member cannot be appointed within a particular time frame. Senator Evans calls it `bureaucratic problems', but they may be real problems and I do not think that we can dismiss them as readily as that because the sanctions being imposed, if not complied with within two days, as the ALP have proposed in their amendments, are pretty severe.  </para></talk.start><para>I think Senator Evans would agree that we also do not want to see residents tipped out of nursing homes prematurely. So this is trying to find a way that is reasonable rather than giving in to some sort of bureaucratic fiddling. We are talking here about trying to find a process which works—not one which just appeases some bureaucrats somewhere. So, Senator Evans, we all have the interests of the residents at heart. I remind the Senate that we are talking here about a maximum number of days and that these appointments can be done much more quickly than that too. So it is not necessarily the case that they will go the full term, as it were. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>19949</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to reinforce what Senator Allison said. I know one could be forgiven for having that view from opposition, but when you are on the government side you welcome and appreciate the efforts of the bureaucracy. As I see it, most mistakes are made when the advice of the bureaucracy is ignored—when in government, that is—because it is their responsibility to make sure that due process is carried out. In this case, if a private provider does not appoint an adviser-administrator after one day, that immediately brings in the sanctions—no `by your leave', thank you very much; it is `good-bye'; it is done—and that means relocation of residents. </para></talk.start><para>I think it is not unreasonable to lengthen that process to five working days. It is for that reason, with the interests of the people who are being cared for predominantly in mind, that this proposal has been put forward. We have accepted, as I said, pulling it back a bit from 14 days to five days. That seems an acceptable outcome insofar as it does put a pretty severe sanction on the provider. They know that within that one working week they have to appoint an adviser-administrator, or else. But 24 hours, I would suggest to Senator Evans, is very difficult. It would be very difficult to get a tradesman in 24 hours and, in this case, you are asking somebody who is providing care for an aged person to get a suitably qualified adviser or administrator appointed within 24 hours—otherwise, it is `bang' and you are done.

I share the concern the Democrats are expressing about the way the government has gone about this issue of dealing with key personnel who are of unsound mind, bankrupt or regarded as undesirable persons. There were a lot of submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the bill which raised concern about how all this would work—concern about discrimination issues and administration issues. Labor has suggested an approach which seeks to put this issue into what apparently are called the principles—I did get advice from the Clerk Assistant that `regulations' was the right word, but I am happy to go with `principles'. Effectively making that a principle would mean that the government would have to consult about the whole mechanism of this provision. If it is put into the principles it would also be a disallowable instrument so that if, following that consultation process, there was concern as to how this was to work, the Senate would have the chance to review it.</para></talk.start><para>The advisers to the government when briefing me on the bill did say they were going to have this consultation process about how all of this was going to work. There is a great deal of concern out there in the industry about that—about the practicalities of it and about the difficulties of it. Our approach was to say no-one wants to argue that people of unsound mind ought to be key personnel in nursing homes. I think even Senator Herron would accept I would not argue that! But nevertheless we have to do that in a fair way and an administratively proper way. We propose as an alternative in our later amendment to provide for it to become a principle and for it therefore to be a disallowable instrument. I am not sure whether in that event there is a need to support the Democrat amendment. I think this is getting into the detail of the problem which has been identified and about which I share concern, but to which I am not sure we are in a position to properly contribute today. I think it does need a consultation process with industry. It does need agreement about how it is all to operate. In a sense, I almost got the feeling that this amendment was the first step down in trying to solve the problem that we have identified. We are looking at an alternative approach which basically says we do not need to get into trying to do it in the Senate here and now.</para><para>So my inclination is not to support that amendment, in favour of the alternative approach. But I am interested to hear from the government. I understand they are now looking to amend that, which I assume means they are going to support the general approach. If that is the case, I would be inclined not to support the Democrat amendment unless I heard reasons why we need both approaches. At the moment I would have thought that deals with the whole issue in another way, but I am open to argument on it. </para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Ross (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Sen-ator Lightfoot)</inline>—We are now dealing with opposition amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 1969.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>19951</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—By way of preface, if the minister is going to vote for these amendments, I think he ought to tell me, and then I won't bother arguing the case.

The amendments to this regime are, I understand, supported by the industry and provide for necessary improvements which have come to light in the course of setting up the administrative framework for the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, ACIS. The bill is the result of a long and hard fought campaign by industry, supported by the Labor opposition, led by a former shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, Mr Crean, to provide assistance to this industry. The bill is in broad alignment with the thrust of the ALP's position on tariffs and helping to improve Australian industry competitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy. Labor will not be opposing the legislation; however, we have one amendment, which I will speak about shortly. </para></talk.start><para>The bill does not provide for the necessary review of the effect that tariff reductions may have on Australia's automotive industry. This Liberal-National government, it seems, is content to leave the industry in the lurch for the next few years. It will reduce certainty to the industry. It could provide much needed certainty by giving the industry an opportunity to put its case prior to 1 January 2005. </para><para>This situation has parallels with the public inquiry into the Liberal-National proposal to sell off one of Australia's most valuable and profitable government enterprises, Telstra. Until the internal dissent between the Liberal and National parties—the National Party, of course, being the doormat of this coalition—was publicly aired recently, and seen to be a threat to the government, which relies on the National Party for its majority, there would have been no Besley inquiry. The coalition would have just gone on full steam ahead with its ideologically driven commitment to privatise the remainder of Telstra, regardless of both the cost to the people in rural and regional Australia and the cost to budget. There is no doubt, even amongst the National Party, the much trampled on junior member of the coalition, that the Besley inquiry and its important findings would not have eventuated without, at least in part, National Party agitation and the concerns expressed by the Labor Party. Surely this parliament will not trust this government to have an inquiry just because it says that it will or it can. The Australian public is rightly suspicious of this government's promise, and the parliament should be too.</para><para>The only way to ensure that an independent public inquiry will occur is for it to be included within the provisions of this bill, and that is why the Labor opposition will be moving a second reading amendment to the legislation this evening. Labor is moving the amendment to address what we regard as the unworkable circumstance created by the Liberal-National government. The government has proposed an inquiry into the automotive industry and the possible impact of a tariff reduction some time in 2005. That is too late. The tariff reduction will have already occurred on 1 January 2005. The government position on this has been made very clear by the cabinet from the outset. At the third dot point of a joint statement dated 5 June 1997, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the then minister for industry said, `There will be a review in 2005.'</para><para>What we have been saying from the outset of this proposed scheme is that it is inappropriate to have the review so late. Commonsense dictates that the review must occur before the tariff cuts take place. When Labor raised this point in the House of Representatives, the government gave an entirely unsatisfactory response. It said that it did not need an amendment about an inquiry because it might have an inquiry anyway. That is not good enough. There is no certainty in this approach. It is simply a sign of either laziness or incompetent administration by the Liberal-National government. Under such an approach we do not actually know that the government will ever hold an inquiry. Therefore, there is almost no certainty about an inquiry occurring at all. Further, there is no guarantee that parliament would ever receive a report from any inquiry that did occur. </para><para>The government's attitude is simply to refuse to allow the industry and the community in general to offer their opinion on the question of automotive tariffs. Under the current scheme there is no guarantee that the public would ever get a chance to make submissions, that the inquiry would be held publicly in an open and transparent way, or that a report flowing from the inquiry would be released. Similarly, there is no guarantee that the affected communities from this very important, regionally based industry would get a chance to make submissions. I include there state governments, particularly those of South Australia and Victoria. </para><para>This is why Labor thinks that a more reasonable approach is to legislate for a formal inquiry to be incorporated in the bill being debated before the Senate this evening. We will seek to amend the bill to the extent that it requires that an inquiry be held at a time before the tariff changes take place. This will allow all participants in the car industry to be certain they will have the opportunity to put their views to parliament before a decision is made on any subsequent tariff changes. If this does not happen, it is simply not possible to know what is going to follow these transitional arrangements, and, if change does occur, precisely how the transitional arrangements are going to operate beyond the year 2005.</para><para>We do not want $2 billion of support to potentially become, after just five years, zero support—and that is exactly what the government are asking parliament to vote for at the moment. That is an unreasonable proposition. The amendment we are proposing is one that the government could accept, but they are being particularly pig-headed. Their negative response to our proposed amendment in the past has been simply a symptom of their `if we didn't write it, then we are not going to accept it' attitude. The government are hoping that everyone will forget that ACIS was not an initiative of the current minister but is an overhang from an initiative announced by the former minister in response to a long, active and ultimately successful campaign by the industry, with the support of the Labor Party.</para><para>Simply because the Labor Party are proposing this very reasonable amendment, the government are now saying, `We do not need anything in this bill about an inquiry. The government might have one, we might not, but either way we will tell you about it at the time. The form of it, if we do have one, will be a form that we will decide on when we are good and ready.' This is a dangerous attitude for the government to take. I might also point out that the Labor Party, if we win government at the end of next year, will also be bound by this provision. That is important to note as well.</para><para>Let me make this point in closing: when, at the next election, there is a change of government, there will be an inquiry into this issue and it will be a public inquiry. The parliament, and in particular senators in this place, will have the opportunity during this debate to ensure that, irrespective of whether there is a change of government or not, that inquiry takes place for the good of Australia's automotive industry and for the people who work within it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>19953</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, or ACIS, bills came to the Senate in October last year. On that occasion, the Australian Democrats welcomed the <inline ref="S266">ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 </inline>and the ensuing five-year scheme to assist our domestic automotive industry to become more internationally competitive by encouraging production, investment, and research and development. The scheme has come about as a result of at least the last three years of consultation with industry. The timing of the passage of this legislation is particularly welcomed in a global car industry environment of mergers, acquisitions and spectacular losses. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries have indicated their full support for the bill and believe that any refinements that may be necessary can be achieved in the regulations.</para></talk.start><para>Nevertheless, last year I did raise a number of concerns. The main concern was that the government continues to label the proposed new scheme as `transitional'. It is clear that the question will arise as to whether the scheme itself should continue beyond the end of the year 2005. This is particularly important because, to achieve the APEC target of free trade by the year 2010, the tariff wind-down program for the automobile industry initiative must surely continue beyond 2005 and up to 2010. While the government has given a commitment to review the ACIS bills in 2005, there must be pressure expected from the industry to extend the assistance program as a trade-off for further tariff cuts. </para><para>On that matter I understand, as Senator Sherry has already indicated, that the opposition will again move an amendment, the effect of which will be to require that the review commence by 1 July 2003, which will, amongst other things, consider the appropriate rates of customs duty to apply from 1 January 2005. As I said last year, the Australian Democrats could see sense in the approach being proposed by the ALP and we were happy to give support to that amendment. More than one year later, with a new scheme about to commence in a little over a month's time, the important issue now is to seek a commitment from the government that it will in fact undertake a review at an appropriate time to ensure, as Senator Minchin would no doubt put it, that certainty and security are provided to our automotive industry; that the industry, which has been consulted, is satisfied that a review will occur; and that Australian consumers receive the flow-on benefits of a productive, world competitive and viable automotive industry.</para><para>Senator Sherry would no doubt agree that, in essence, the reforms are largely the result of the Button plan, and they have been about improving the overall competitiveness of the automotive industry by focusing on the reduction of tariffs, improving productivity, increasing total vehicle sales, increasing exports and increasing our market access in overseas destinations. What is also essential in the reform process is to ensure that the outlook for the industry allows future investment, that it provides home-grown jobs, that research and development initiatives are put in place and supported, and that there is local support for local industry.</para><para>I met yesterday with Mr Peter Sturrock of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. It is clear that, while there have been difficulties in adjusting to a tariff wind-down regime, they are supportive of this bill. Industry agreed plans for this matter include support for the tariff reduction regime falling to 10 per cent in 2005; commercial vehicles remaining at the current five per cent duty; the Export Facilitation Scheme ceasing this year; ACIS running from 2001 to 2005, with $2 billion being available to industry to reward investment and research and development; support for the strategy to pursue market access overseas; and, more significantly, a next car plan review being done in 2002 or perhaps 2003 for the post-2005 period.</para><para>The question of the review is clearly essential from the point of view of the FCAI. What is in dispute is whether a review should be given as a legislative guarantee, or by regulation or administrative policy. The FCAI have strongly indicated their preference for the latter so as not to disturb the agreed outcome. They are further satisfied that a review at an appropriate time is inevitable, pending further discussions and negotiations between industry and the government of the day. So I am satisfied that a review will inevitably occur at an appropriate time prior to the end of ACIS in 2005.</para><para>Given the need for this scheme to commence on 1 January next year, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the opposition's amendment on this second occasion. However, I do foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment calling upon the government to give an undertaking that a review of ACIS will be conducted within a reasonable time frame but not less than 12 months before ACIS ceases in 2005.</para><para>It is certainly the Democrats' hope that the passage of the ACIS bill will enable Australian automotive manufacturers to build upon success stories so far, and I think they do need to be put on the record. There are success stories such as the export of 100,000 Toyota Camrys to the Gulf and Middle East region from the Altona plant in Victoria. General Motors-Holden have also identified the Middle East as an export market suitable for expansion and have exported 30,000 Commodores there in the past year alone. Mitsubishi have exported 15,000 vehicles to the USA over the past 12 months, which it claims are worth some half a billion dollars in exports. That provides much needed employment in its two Adelaide plants and of course the many Australian component manufacturers in both South Australia and Victoria. I am told that the decision to proceed with the production of Toyota's new Avalon range in Australia was made partly in anticipation of the introduction of this legislation and that overall it is anticipated that new investment in the order of $4 billion may be realised by 2005 under the scheme. </para><para>The latest range of Australian built cars offer extraordinarily good value for money, and it will hopefully not be too long before the rest of the world realises this and we secure a healthy future for the industry in Australia. I think it is also important that we continue to design and build vehicles suited to Australian conditions. Our vehicles are currently being built to cope with a range of conditions that make them suitable for export to virtually every continent, and our workers are acknowledged as being capable of producing cars with exceptional build quality and value for money. There is no denying that the build quality of Australian vehicles has improved considerably in the past few years and that we are capable of manufacturing some truly world-class vehicles that offer exceptional value for money. Australian technology has been showcased with international exhibitions of our capabilities—concept cars such as aXessaustralia, although I acknowledge the recent announcements about that particular company being taken over by a multinational. The Ecommodore is another example. It is to be hoped that the further development of such concept cars will extend to the production stage. This has been a project that Australians can be very proud of.</para><para>It seems far more sensible to me that we go down the path of developing vehicles with the sort of performance consumers need, rather than have the motoring press herald the arrival of 250 or 300 kilowatt V8 supercars that the average motorist will never fully utilise legally. From the Democrats' perspective, car manufacturers are sitting on the answer to fuel efficiency, and it is to be hoped that fuel cell powered, hydrogen powered and other alternatively powered vehicles will be developed, built and exported from Australia around the world. Australian industry should be leading the way in the development of such vehicles. There is no doubt that if clean green cars can be built and sold at the right price, people will choose to buy and drive them. It is to be hoped that this legislation will aid in the birth of such `new age' cars and componentry as part of the Australian manufacturing industry.</para><para>The Australian Democrats support the bill and trust that Australian car manufacturers will see the future, grasp the opportunity and develop a worldwide reputation for building innovative, fuel efficient vehicles domestically and, more importantly, for export. Finally, the second reading amendment on sheet 2047 has been circulated in my name and I ask that it be dealt with at the appropriate time. I move:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>		"but the Senate calls on the Government to give an undertaking that a review of the ACIS Scheme will be conducted within a reasonable timeframe, but not less than 12 months, before the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme ceases in 2005".</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>19955</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I briefly respond by thanking the opposition and the Democrats for their support for the <inline ref="S266">ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000</inline>, which I regret it was necessary to bring on, but we did uncover a technical amendment that needed to be made to ensure the integrity of the scheme and its proper and effective delivery. I regret it because it has meant that we have revived what I think is a quite silly and semantic debate which we had over a year ago where the proposition being advanced by the ALP again tonight was debated and defeated. I think it is really quite silly and churlish to do it all over again on the eve of the scheme coming into effect. We said then that of course we had already committed to a review. To get into a semantic argument about the timing of the review seemed quite silly.  </para></talk.start><para>I think it is critical that the industry has the certainty of knowing that the tariff will remain at 15 per cent for the next five years but that it will drop to 10 per cent in 2005. The government has said from the outset that the basis for taxpayers and the government forgoing revenue of some $2 billion over the next five years to ensure that this industry does invest in the latest technology and R&amp;D is to make sure that it is ready to be as competitive as will be required when the tariff drops to 10 per cent. Others have spoken about the tremendous improvement in the quality of Australian cars, and I add my name to that. But the industry admitted that is clearly a function of the fact that tariffs have dropped, initiated by the opposition when it was in government, and for the industry to have to be more competitive and to produce more competitive and better built automobiles. They have responded to the challenge and done it very well. </para><para>The trouble with where the opposition in particular is coming from is that it leaves open the possibility that somehow that tariff commitment of 10 per cent in 2005 may not happen. I think that is the worst signal to send. The scheme is premised on helping the industry to prepare for that tariff cut in 2005. There will be a question for the government of the day to decide whether or not there is a case for this particular scheme or a variant of it continuing beyond 2005. We have indicated that there should be a review to determine that question, and that will be a matter for the government of the day. What I find extraordinary about the ALP's position is that it is so defeatist and so admitting of the probability that they are not going to be in government that they want to enshrine it in legislation. We are happy to accept their view that we are more than likely to be still in government at that time, but it does seem to me quite defeatist and really quite silly to be putting something like a review into legislation.</para><para>But I am very appreciative of the Democrats agreeing that what is necessary is to ensure that there is no hold-up in this scheme coming into effect and that they are prepared to move their proposition as a second reading amendment and not seek to amend the bill itself.

I know the time of the year and the pressures on the program. I just want to make a couple of points before we move to a vote on this matter. Firstly, I refer to the Democrat second reading amendment. The reason why we are pursuing our amendment and did not support the Australian Democrat amendment moved by Senator Ridgeway is that using words like `calls on', `to give an undertaking' and `reasonable timeframe' is not giving a level of surety as to the timetable and conduct of an inquiry that we would require. </para><para>In my second reading debate contribution, I have touched on Labor's reasons for wanting included in the legislation a number of issues in relation to the conduct of the inquiry. Obviously, in respect of an independent public inquiry, a clear time frame is needed, which is included in subclause (1). It must be an `independent' inquiry. The terms of reference are laid out in subclause (2). In subclause (3) is the need for public hearings and the calling of submissions. Fourthly, there is the calling of evidence in private `on matters that are commercially sensitive'—for obvious reasons. Fifthly, there is the delivery of the report to the minister before 31 March 2004. Finally, there is a requirement that a copy of the report `be laid before each House of the Parliament as soon as practicable' after it is received by the minister, whoever that will be.</para><para>I note the minister's comments about the result of the next election. Certainly, Minister, the Labor Party are not so arrogant as to assume that we will win the next election. I believe we will win it but that we will have to work very, very hard. I will not touch on the policy issues that we will have to work hard on. I still believe that we will win the next election; you believe you will win it. It is up to the people to decide. There is no concession and no admission, and we will work hard to make sure that, when we do consider this legislation next year, you will be sitting over here considering it in whatever detail is required.</para><para>The reasons for having the inquiry are as I have outlined. Very briefly, the resolution passed earlier is not binding on the government, and we wanted a clear, specific timetable before the year 2005. We believe at least in part that the government is not accepting our position because it emanates from the Labor Party. I do not think that is a particularly positive approach. We believe there should be certainty that there will be an inquiry: circumstances may change in the industry and in the market and people involved in the industry and others who have quite legitimate concerns, such as state governments, are entitled to know that an inquiry will take place and what the parameters of that inquiry will be. There is some $2 billion in moneys involved here. We believe it is perfectly appropriate that there be considerable public scrutiny of, amongst other issues, the $2 billion in moneys that are being committed to this. We do not believe that is an unreasonable proposition.</para><para>It is a matter of regret to me that the Australian Democrats have indicated they will not be supporting our amendment. We believe that, regardless of who is in government—and I certainly hope that it will be the Labor Party—we should be ensuring that a commitment is given here and now in the legislation that that inquiry will take place. As I indicated earlier, it is the time of year when we have a difficult program to get through. The Democrats have indicated their position. I have put our remarks on the record and the reason why we have continued to pursue this matter. I will conclude my remarks there. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>19958</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicated in my second reading speech that the government opposed this amendment for very good reasons.

As you just said, Madam Chair, this situation is less than satisfactory. That is not a criticism. I recognise that there are circumstances that could lead to any of us bringing things in at the last second—I would not want to criticise others because I am sure at some stage in the future I will be in that situation myself—even though we obviously try to avoid dropping things in at the last minute. As we have said many times before, particularly with respect to social security legislation, it really does present a difficulty if we are unsure about what we are doing and in what order we are doing it. It is technical legislation. It is a technical act. This particular bill, the <inline ref="R1096">Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Debt Recovery) Bill 2000</inline>, deals with some specifically technical matters. I think it would be desirable to move to report progress, but I am not going to do so unless there is some indication that the government is fine with bringing on the next item. I personally think it would be helpful to move to report progress, but I think that would be better for the government or perhaps the opposition to do because they would need to be sure that they could move on to another item. </para></talk.start><para>As I think all of us have said at different times in this place, it is dangerous to deal with amendments on the run and when we are unsure about the order. As I read things, without anticipating debate and statements people are going to make on this legislation, this is not a situation where everybody knows how everyone is going to vote on everything. It is yet to be unfolded what amendments, if any, will be agreed to. In such a dynamic situation, if you like, it is particularly dangerous to be flying blind. To do so would probably mean that we would stuff it up somewhere along the way and have to come back and fix it up anyway. So it would take more time in the long run. Unless everything has become clear in the last minute, I would suggest that it may be highly desirable to report progress, look at all things and come back clear and fresh at 9.30 in the morning. We could probably sail through it reasonably quickly. It is certainly not the Democrats' intention to take a lot of time on this bill. I have about 35 amendments circulated in my name on behalf of the Democrats, and some of those are in groups. Whilst the amendments are technical, the issues are not overly complex and it should not take a lot of time. It would probably take us twice as long if we dealt with the amendments now, and possibly twice as long again because we would probably stuff it up, because we would have to figure out what we are doing as we go along. That is always undesirable.  </para><para>As I have also said in this place many times before, it is important to keep reminding ourselves that, apart from being parliamentarians, we are also legislators. We are making laws. This is a law making process. The laws affect the Australian community, particularly if you are talking about social security laws. This particular bill potentially affects hundreds of thousands of people in the Australian community each year. We want to make sure that we know what we are doing and that the will of the Senate and the parliament prevails. I think the best way to do that would be to be totally clear about what is going on rather than to do it by the seat of our pants. Having said that, I do know that the government has to find other legislation to be brought on. If nothing else, my outlining this situation a little bit more clearly might have provided a bit more time to decide the best way to go. My personal preference would be that we report progress and move on to something else. But, clearly, that is a decision for the chamber as a whole. I would rather take the government's lead on where to go in that regard. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Without a running sheet, I have no way of knowing what is crossing over one another.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>19960</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think we are all in the same boat.

I will then briefly refer to the second reading amendment that the opposition has circulated and will speak to in due course.</para></talk.start><para>This bill, in a different form, first came to the House around this time late last year as the <inline ref="R969">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline>. At that stage, both the government and the opposition regarded the bill as relatively non-contentious, and there was not major opposition to the passage of the majority of the content of the bill. Some time immediately prior to the bill being introduced into the House, there were some further negotiations—with Senator Alston on behalf of the government, and Mr Smith on behalf of the opposition. In those discussions, the opposition put it to the government that a section of the <inline ref="R969">Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999</inline> should be deleted and considered in the New Year when the parliament resumed. Labor put it to the government that, on the provision of international communications, the appropriate minister—whether it be the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts or the Minister for Foreign Affairs—should be granted power under the act to appropriate licences or, as we put it, matters of substance worthy of serious and considered deliberation. My understanding was the government was not overly happy at that stage to separate those particular provisions in the bill but agreed to do so in the negotiation process. </para><para>When parliament resumed earlier this year, the matter was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for consideration of the content of the outstanding matters. Senators Hogg and Schacht are members of that committee on behalf of the opposition, and they attended the hearings and participated in the deliberations. They made a brief additional statement at the conclusion of the report of the committee—which was lengthy; some 20-odd pages—and they made the point, by way of introduction, that the opposition members of the committee agreed with the report of the committee insofar as it goes. There was only one issue on which opposition members could not agree with other members of the committee—those other members being government members—and that was the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para><para>A significant number of submissions were made to the Senate inquiry, and they are listed in Appendix 1. I will not bother to read them. They did raise an issue of some consequence, a matter which the opposition has held to at that time. That question, reduced to basics, was whether it was appropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the minister for communications to decide whether a particular international broadcasting service, or an application for an international broadcasting service, was contrary to the national interest in respect of international relations. So the two key areas are: who should have control of this agenda in Australia—the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the minister for communications; secondly—the guiding test, if you like—whether considerations of national interest were paramount in the issuing of a licence, the withdrawal of a licence or attaching conditions to the issuance of a licence.</para><para>As I recall the discussions at the committee and the position of the government and the department as given in evidence before the committee—and I understand it is their position now—it is without precedent for a government minister with essentially domestic responsibilities, that is, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to be involved in consideration of international or foreign affairs matters which are part and parcel of the issuing or withdrawing of licences to broadcast into and out of this country. The government held steadfastly to that position. They were of the view that it was appropriately reserved for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </para><para>The opposition have given this matter some consideration, and we hold to our arguments; that is, it is appropriate for the minister for communications to be the decision maker in this light. I suppose that if a contentious matter came across the desk of the relevant minister, he or she would, as a matter of caution and a matter of courtesy, consult with his or her colleagues as to the desired outcome. But in the government's preferred model, whilst it would be unprofessional not to consult with colleagues on a contentious matter, the government's final decision maker in this matter is the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The opposition is of the view that there should be a two-stage process: firstly, that the minister for communications is required to consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and, secondly, that the final decision is made by the minister for communications. In that context, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs were concerned about a particular international broadcast, he or she could take the initiative and advise the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to take appropriate action.  </para><para>We take the view that, in this contentious area—and we only have to examine the amount of involvement the current government has had to have in trade, defence and foreign affairs matters, particularly in the last two years—it is not to be unexpected that any range of foreign governments might take the opportunity, in the course of negotiations, to attempt to put pressure on, or bring about a particular result from, the Minister for Foreign Affairs which does not reflect the broader, long-term national interests of this country. In that respect, the opposition is of the view that that decision, as it relates to broadcasting in and out of this country, is appropriately made by the minister for communications.</para><para>It is our view that if decisions in respect of the national interest under the Broadcasting Services Act were the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, it would place the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a better position to handle pressure which might be applied in particular circumstances by foreign governments. That is the rationale for our overall policy approach in this area. This is primarily and substantially a broadcasting matter. It relates to broadcasts in and out of Australia to both commercial and government enterprises. We are of the view that it is appropriate for the government minister of the day to consult with cabinet colleagues when a particularly contentious matter arises for a decision. But because the application relates to broadcasting, it is appropriately within the purview of the minister for communications. In no way do we want this to be portrayed as an attack on the current government or on the carrying out of these sorts of affairs of state by either the current Minister for Foreign Affairs or the current minister for communications. We offer no criticism, at this stage, of the conduct of those portfolios; we simply draw attention to the changing nature of the region and the increasing pressures in trade, defence and diplomatic areas. </para><para>We think it is appropriate, upon mature consideration, for an essentially domestic issue to be reserved for the minister for communications. We will move amendments in due course to give effect to that. They will require that the minister for communications consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that the power for the issuing of licences be given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para><para>We will also be moving a second reading amendment in due course. That second reading amendment will state that, whilst not declining to give this bill a second reading, the Senate, recognising the key role played by Radio Australia as our public international broadcaster in explaining Australia's national values to the world, and in particular encouraging closer ties with our Asian and South Pacific neighbours, as well as serving the needs of Australians abroad: (1) notes that the Howard government's funding cuts to our national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, have caused significant adverse funding cuts to Radio Australia; (2) notes that these adverse cuts have only been partially restored by the government's recent decision to provide Radio Australia with an additional $9 million over three years; (3) notes that the Howard government's decision to lease the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility has resulted in a severe diminution of Radio Australia's transmission capacity and ability to reach audiences in Asia; (4) notes that this capacity will only be partially restored even if Radio Australia can successfully negotiate transmission capacity from the Cox Peninsula transmitter facility from the current leaseholders; (5) condemns the Howard government for this reduction in public funding and transmission capacity for Radio Australia; and (6) calls upon the government to maximise Radio Australia's capacity to communicate with our Asian and South Pacific neighbours and for the enhancement of its international broadcasting capacity; (7) expresses its concern that the bill makes the Minister for Foreign Affairs and not the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts responsible for deciding whether an application for an international broadcasting licence or whether an international broadcasting service is contrary to the national interest; and (8) calls upon the government to amend the bill to provide for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advise the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on whether an application for an international broadcasting service is contrary to the national interest. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Shayne (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Murphy)</inline>—Before you proceed further, Senator Bishop, the amendment that I have before me contains only six clauses.

This amendment really does transverse an issue that has been the subject of some discussion in this chamber and in the House of Representatives for the best part of the last three or four years. It addresses an issue that has been the subject of widespread alarm in the community and it addresses an issue which has been the subject of copious amounts of correspondence—certainly to my office and, I presume, to the offices of other senators, particularly those involved in this debate. It goes to the role of the transmitter facility on Cox Peninsula in Australia and to the desire and the ability of our country to broadcast messages into East Asia, South Asia and across to the Pacific Islands. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition takes a very simple view on this issue. We take the view that we are a major player in this region. We have a long tradition of arguing for democracy and human rights and for the establishment and maintenance of market based economies. We say, without reservation, that they are positive things. In this area there are lots of regimes known to us which do not subscribe to those sorts of values or to the integrities inherent in those sorts of values to the extent that governments of either major party in this country do. We say that those values are absolutes and are worthy of discussion, are worthy of persuasion and are worthy of articulation in the community of East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific Islands. We say that a well-funded Radio Australia, preferably with access to its own facilities, but, if not with access to its own facilities, with access to sufficient finance to arrange its own facilities, is something that is of critical importance to the future of this country. We have repeatedly said that in the House. I recall that within the last month or so there was a rather lengthy debate in this chamber one Thursday afternoon on the future of Radio Australia.</para><para>We have had no cause to revise our criticisms of the government over the last few years on this issue. We think it was a poor step, a retrograde step, and a step taken without adequate planning for the future when the budget of Radio Australia was cut. Again it was a poor step and a step taken without adequate foresight when the Cox facility was sold off to another competitor broadcaster. We think both of those decisions of government were poor and, in due course, if we are elected into government next year, we intend to remedy both of those deficiencies. </para><para>I recall last week at estimates questioning the ABC representatives on the future of Radio Australia and the recently concluded negotiations whereby the ABC was given an extra $9 million or $11 million for three years to try to overcome some of the difficulties that organisation had come into consequent upon, and relating to, the cuts inflicted on its funding by the current government. The representatives of the ABC were trying to avoid the issue but, when pinned down, they made the point that even with the extra $9 million or $11 million over three years they went nowhere close to restoring the funding position they had when the cuts were first visited upon them, that their range of programs had diminished as a consequence and would not be restored to the levels that were extant when the cuts were imposed upon that organisation and that the volume of broadcasting hours, whilst it would be increased—and that was a welcome step—would not again be restored to the levels that were present when those cuts were imposed upon ABC by the current government. </para><para>We do, as I said, take the view that, in this rapidly changing world where there are great pressures being imposed upon this country for access to our markets, where there are indeed great pressures being placed upon this government—and possibly ourselves in the future—to adopt attitudes that are more compliant to the dictates of major powers in this area, it is incumbent upon the Australian government of the day to act responsibly, to have regard to the long-term interests of this country and, in carrying out that obligation which governments freely choose to adopt, to have regard to those earlier features of our system of government that operates in this country. We are strongly of the view that a government should have the ability to send out its message on issues in the region, whether it be on East Timor, on Bougainville, on developments in Vietnam or on developments in the Pacific Islands, in particular Fiji, to neighbouring countries and their citizens. Our government does, and should have, a perspective on those issues. Radio Australia is critical to putting those views out into the wider community of nations that are to the north of our continent. Radio Australia, while certainly not an arm of government—it is an independent agency but is funded by the state—does have that critical role to present the views of this country and the government of the day.

The bill provides for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether the granting of an international broadcasting licence is in the national interest. Importantly, the bill provides an exemption for services broadcast by the two national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. Radio Australia is included in this framework. There has been no regulatory regime for international broadcasts in the past because governments have never seen a need for the introduction of such a regulatory regime. The two international broadcasts from Australia into the region and other parts of the world were both ABC broadcasts, delivered via short-wave radio on Radio Australia and via television on Australian Television International which, of course, has most recently been operated by Channel 7. We know that the government is currently assessing submissions for the granting of a licence to continue the Australia Television service to the Asia-Pacific region and is seeking an editorially independent Australian television presence in the region projecting accurate images and perceptions of Australia. </para></talk.start><para>To provide this service the government is also considering providing funding assistance for both programming and transmission. I make this point because of the absurdity that the government is considering subsidising a commercial broadcast service into the region when it has cut the same size subsidy from the ABC. Funding cuts forced the ABC to cut back drastically on the funding of all its services, its international broadcasting services included. It is a pity the government was not so generous when the ABC ran the Australia Television service. In accordance with its act and with other legislation, the ABC provided editorially independent news and current affairs, and a general programming service. But of course anything run by ABC or operated by the ABC is, in the eyes of this government, inherently unworthy.</para><para>This is not to say that other providers of an Australian television service cannot provide a good service. Imparja Television is just one tenderer. But I do believe that the loss of the ABC operated Australia Television service was a huge loss to Australia and to the region. The government's vicious cuts to the ABC in the 1996-97 budget substantially weakened the ABC's ability to provide the high level and full range of international broadcasting services that it once did. At the time that Mr Mansfield recommended the cessation of the ABC's international broadcasting services, all of them—not that he was asked to recommend whether they should keep going or not but he did recommend that anyway—the government mothballed the state-of-the-art short-wave transmission facility at Cox Peninsula. There has never been an adequate explanation for the closure of that facility. That can only lead us to conclude that it was merely to save the government money. I have heard a couple of amounts of how much it would have cost to keep Cox Peninsula operating: $1.6 million per annum is one figure, the one I have heard most. That $1.6 million per annum would be the cost to have the Cox Peninsula transmitter fully operational again and for Radio Australia to regain its full voice to the region. In some areas of Sydney, of course, $1.6 million would not even buy you a house. For this relatively ridiculous amount of money, the government refused to reopen the Cox Peninsula facility, at least for Radio Australia. They were happy for it to be sold off and to be operated by somebody else, but Radio Australia could not have that facility.</para><para>Recently the government announced that it had leased the land and sold the equipment to an international broadcaster unlicensed in Australia. This is partially the reason for this legislation, of course. Having sold this desperately needed equipment to a foreign broadcaster, it had to somehow provide a proper regime under which the sale could be justified and the broadcaster allowed to operate from Australia. The Democrats understand the price the government received from the sale of the Cox Peninsula transmitter—and this is only a rumour, I have to say; nobody has said what the sale amounts to but it is rumoured—to be about $2 million. I noticed that one of the opposition speakers in the other place nominated an amount of $2½ million. I hope it is that little bit more, laughable amount as it is. I recall that the last upgrade to the transmitter was something like $20 million. To sell it for that amount truly has to be the worst case of economic mismanagement of public funds that anybody has ever seen. This figure is even worse if you take into account the depreciation of the asset. Such a valuable asset sold off so cheaply—valuable both in terms of need for having the service into the region and in terms of money!</para><para>I would like to comment briefly on the definition of `the national interest' in the bill. The Senate committee, which I was on, heard that it is not possible to define precisely what sort of broadcast would be in the national interest or would be likely to be contrary to the national interest. However, some broadcasting services are more likely to be contrary than others. For example, hostile broadcasters promoting communal violence or terrorism on a foreign state or inciting or promoting or encouraging armed hostilities or the violent overthrow of an established government would likely be viewed as contrary to Australia's national interests. Likewise, broadcasts which demean persons or groups on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual preference, religion, or mental or physical disability would also be likely to be unacceptable. Of course there are issues for the minister to take into consideration, but it would be unlikely that a potential broadcaster would make it clear that this was going to be the content or the intent of its broadcast content. Some content may be less than obvious and much more insidious. </para><para>Thankfully, the government has agreed to amend the bill in accordance with the concerns voiced by the Senate committee and, as Senator Bishop said, that was all members of the Senate committee including the government ones. The minister will now table the reasons given for not providing an international broadcasting licence to an international broadcasting licence aspirant, and the applicant can appeal the decision. To a point at least, this provides some transparency in the process. I am also pleased that ABC and SBS services delivered in accordance with their charters will be exempt from having to apply for an international broadcasting licence. On the issue of the opposition's second reading amendment, I can indicate now that we will be supporting that amendment, particularly because it is so strong on the funding and importance of Radio Australia. I hope that the strong language of support used by the opposition in this motion about Radio Australia means that they will be willing to support my `must carry' amendment which I am going to be moving in the committee stage.</para><para>While I am on my feet, I will just say a few things about that amendment. The amendment would mean that an international broadcaster with the capacity to broadcast more than three short-wave signals at once would be required to provide space to the ABC for the purposes of Radio Australia broadcasts. The amendment also provides that the licence holder would be paid an appropriate fee. Of course, we do not want to fall foul of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, so that would cover us for that. The passing of the proposed amendment would ensure that Radio Australia would be broadcast from the Cox Peninsula transmission facility, going at least some way to restoring the service lost following the budget cuts of four years ago. We should not forget, as well, that international broadcasting services covered by this bill may not be Australian services; Australian broadcasters may not provide the content.</para><para>In closing, I indicate that the Democrats are supporting this bill because we believe that the provision of an international broadcasting service from Australia into the region should be licensed and should be approved in order that such broadcasts are not contrary to the national interest. The Democrats are concerned that such services used to be provided by the ABC without fear of their ever contravening the national interest and in the knowledge that such services were provided most economically. We continue to be concerned that these services may not deliver the same level or type of content as the past ABC services. That would be a huge loss to Australia, and we continue to urge the government to properly fund the ABC, not just for their domestic service but for their international service, a service that has been acknowledged around the world and particularly in our region as being one of the best in the world, and a service that this government has consistently tried to get rid of.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>19966</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Senator Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendment moved by Senator Bishop is known in the trade as a pious amendment—in this case, it is incredibly pious. What the amendment is doing is condemning the government for taking a range of decisions based on Radio Australia and particularly the Cox Peninsula. I think it is important to understand that, when cuts to government expenditure had to be made four years ago when the coalition government was elected, the Australian Labor Party did not support one of those cuts. They opposed, tooth and nail, every single cut to government expenditure that has been made by the coalition government. They are in some sort of denial about the deficits they left. The $10 billion deficit that was left in the final financial year by the Keating-Beazley government gained a lot of prominence—we talked about the black hole that was called Beazley's bankcard, and it got a lot of publicity at the time. But what a lot of people do not understand is that the $10 billion in the last year was only one of about five deficits of that order in as many years and that they ran serial deficits of more than $10 billion. </para></talk.start><para>Why I relate this to Radio Australia and the Cox Peninsula is that it is very easy when you are the opposition to criticise a government that is trying to take a budget out of serial serious deficits—$10 billion a year, year on year on year—which are forcing the Commonwealth to borrow. But it is the taxpayers of today and of tomorrow who have to pay back the interest—and we were paying to the banks, foreign lenders, something like $10 billion a year just in interest, close to the entire defence budget, close to the entire education budget in Australia. This government made a decision that you cannot maintain your independence in the world, you cannot maintain living standards for the citizens of Australia if your fundamental economy is based on borrowing $10 billion every year, if you are basically spending $10 billion a year more than you are earning. So we had to go about making a whole range of cuts. It is easy for an opposition, especially an opposition that has run such a loose economy, that has mismanaged the economy, that has run interest rates that have been up to 30 per cent for small businesses at times, that has had unemployment rates that are high, inflation rates that are high—basically a range of economic policies that have destroyed the lives of so many individuals, such as one million unemployed people. You remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, that at times there were massive interest rates. But for the government to make these cuts it has to look seriously at every angle, every part of Commonwealth expenditure. </para><para>Of course you can say, `You didn't have to cut this, you didn't have to cut that. You didn't really have to make these savings.' But all of us know that if you are trying to make your own household budget balance at the end of the month you have to look at all areas of expenditure. It is the same when you are running a national economy; it is no different. You can always say, `Gee, we would really like that, and we would really like this. We would like to go out to Hungry Jack's again this week. We would like to go to the movies.' Of course you would, but there are some things you just cannot do. Ultimately you have to balance the budget, unless you want to keep running a fiscally irresponsible ship. The people who suffer most when you do that at the national level in Australia are the battlers who are on average weekly earnings. When the interest rates went up to 17 per cent—as they did often under Labor; 30 per cent for many small business—and you went to AGC or a number of secondary lenders in those days, you used to have to pay 30, 31 or 32 per cent effective interest rates on small business lending, development finance and so forth. It is very hard if you are a householder with a mortgage in the suburbs of any of our capital cities, you are raising some children, you have a car in the driveway, you are paying lease payments on your car, and you are paying mortgage payments on your house, when these people opposite spend all the money, live outside their means, act irresponsibly—as they are doing now, quite frankly, because they are irresponsible as an opposition. You cannot say, `We are a new Labor Party, we are going to be economically responsible, we are going to balance the budget', but then, when the government proposes expenditure restraint, take the populist route, which is to say, `Well, we oppose that.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator Mark Bishop</name></talker><para>—You don't spend your surplus now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Senator Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—You never had the problem of spending a surplus because you have never had one. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—That's wrong.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Senator Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—No, sorry, that is wrong.

I discussed them in some detail in my contribution to the second reading debate. I will not bother to go into them again at length; I simply place on the record that the opposition is of the strong view that the power to make decisions in the broadcast area as to issuance of licences for broadcasting of material out of this country should be vested in the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, not in the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We do say without reservation that it is appropriate for the minister for communications to consult with his ministerial or cabinet colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on matters that are relevant to that minister's domain. Obviously that could affect trade matters, diplomatic matters and defence matters relating to material that is broadcast by broadcasters out of this country and the licences issued to that particular entity. However, we do take the view that, for a range of reasons, principally that the matter relates to domestic issues, that final decision should be a matter for the minister for communications. As I said at the outset, I am not going to go into those reasons at length. I simply refer to the additional statement prepared by Senators Schacht and Hogg for the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee inquiry into this bill and their reasons for the recommendation in supporting our argument tonight.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>19971</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats believe that this is more a matter of the power to determine what is in the national interest than a broadcasting matter.

I am just trying to remember back, but it was the information that I quoted in my speech in the second reading debate a little while ago. Therefore, we would rather that the Minister for Foreign Affairs retained that power as it is in the original bill. We will be voting against all of these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>19971</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak in support of the amendments moved by my colleague Senator Bishop on behalf of the opposition. In his remarks he quite rightly drew attention to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee report on the bill. There was a minority report signed by Senator Hogg and me, representing the opposition on this committee, making a major recommendation on the issue of which minister should have the power in the national interest to allow or disallow the licence. I am disappointed to hear my colleague Senator Bourne from the Democrats disagreeing with the opposition on this issue. Usually she is absolutely reliable on these sorts of issues of broadcasting and foreign affairs. I do not think that we have too often disagreed on these sorts of issues, Senator Bourne.</para></talk.start><para>Before I talk to the amendments we are moving, I want to put on the record a couple of the points that came out of the inquiry, and the background to this bill. One should remember that the reason this bill is before the parliament is fundamentally that the government wanted to close down the Cox Peninsula transmitter and sell it off to the highest bidder in the private sector, whether it is a national or an international consortium, to broadcast some message other than what the ABC, a statutory authority established by this parliament, had done through Radio Australia for so many years, and very successfully so.</para><para>Before this government moved to allow this facility to be closed down, the previous government had spent nearly $30 million over a number of years to upgrade it to a high quality transmitter, putting a strong signal on behalf of Radio Australia into practically all of Asia. It was a signal that was respected and that had credibility equal to that of the BBC's Overseas Service in that it was listened to by people throughout Asia, who knew that this was a factual service, providing decent information on what was going on in the world and in the region. Only we and the BBC had that credibility. This government, in a narrow-minded fund saving measure, closed it down. It is an extravagant waste of taxpayers' money for which no justification has been given other than the ideological obsession of this government to get at the ABC.</para><para>When they appointed Mr Mansfield to do a review, they did not realise that he would recommend that the only way to maintain the ABC to enable it to continue all its domestic services with a $50 million cut was to cut the overseas service. So the government were stuck with a decision which has been roundly condemned by various parliamentary committees on a bipartisan basis—signed up to by government members, as well as by Democrat and Labor Party members. It has been condemned by any knowledgeable group of interest in the international community in Australia and by many countries overseas which recognise the service that Radio Australia provided. When the signal was reduced, it was received with incredulity in many parts of Asia by governments and, above all else, by populations. </para><para>When the government wanted to sell it they found that some of the bids coming in were from organisations about which the foreign affairs department said, `Hang on, Minister Alston, it may not be in the national interest having a non-Australian organisation broadcasting from Cox Peninsula a signal into Asia that may upset our relations with various Asian countries.' </para><para>We do not believe that we should have a signal that automatically kowtows to what one-party governments in various parts of Asia may wish to hear or not hear. We think Radio Australia quite rightly and proudly re-cei-ved criticism from authoritarian governments in Asia in particular when the truth was broadcast. But the organisations that were going to bid for this licence may not nec-essarily have the interests of Australia at heart. </para><para>The foreign affairs department delayed the sale of this magnificent asset at Cox Peninsula because they kept saying that that organ-is-ation and its bid may not be in the national in-terest of Australia. An example was given at the hearings. What would we do if an organ-isation that got the licence to put a signal into Asia was proselytising against the Islamic religion—and just to the north of us is the most populous Islamic country in the world, Indonesia—and in favour of another rel-igion? That is not impossible because we know around the world that there are religious groups that would like the opportunity, us-ing their own theology, to do such broadcasts. Or what if we had an organisation from another country that was putting propagan-da out in favour of their own country and attacking another country or another country's policy? As I say, we have no objection to Radio Australia doing that because that is our organisation, established by this parliament, with a public charter to provide factual information and services. </para><para>Out of this mess started by the government's stupid decision to sell Cox Peninsula they then had to look at drafting a set of rules on how you would grant licences not just for Cox Peninsula but if someone else might want to do it elsewhere. We have now opened a Pandora's box of people wanting to come into Australia. If they do not want to bid for Cox Peninsula, they may want to build their own transmitter and transmit another signal. We have now gone through what has been a tortuous process. We have had this bill before the parliament, and the debate about it, for well over a year in one form or another. And finally the government's legislation says that the foreign affairs minister should have the power in the national interest. </para><para>In the committee hearings that took place, Senator Hogg and I took the view that it would be better in the national interest to separate the position of the foreign affairs minister from the communications minister, and that the communications minister should have the power in the national interest to make the decision—obviously on cabinet advice—and he or she should be the one who signs the order to oppose the sale. We did this because we believe it is important, in the subtleties and complexities of international relations, not to have the foreign affairs minister having to go as the responsible minister to various countries where we might have refused a local company the right to have the licence. We think it is better for him or her to be able to say, `I have made representations to the communications minister outlining the international consequences. I put my view about it, but the communications minister took a different decision.' It is quite an acceptable arrangement that the foreign affairs minister is one step removed from making the actual decision. </para><para>Let me give an example. If an organisation with an Islamic background wanted to get a licence to broadcast from Australia, and we found that unfortunately that group might have some antisocial features at an international level—I will not say terrorist connections, but features about it that are unsavoury and are not in accordance with our views on international relations and international human rights—we may wish to say, `No, you can't get the licence.' The company may well come from an Islamic country in the Middle East where that signal would go. I know what would happen. The foreign affairs minister would be lobbied, if he were the one making the decision, to change the decision. What we propose here is an opportunity for him to say, `I have passed your representations on to the minister for communications, but it is his decision, not mine.' Therefore, if the decision did go against such an application, the foreign affairs minister would be one step removed and would be able to say, `It is not my signature on the refusal but that of the minister for communications. It is properly his decision.'  </para><para>I have to say to my colleague Senator Bourne, who has a great and knowledgeable inter-est in foreign affairs, that I find it strange that anyone would think that it would be better not to have the communications minister with the power to make decisions. The foreign minister should have the discretion not to be responsible and to be able to stay one step back from that. We have to recog-nise that international relations are subtle and complex and we should not hamstring the foreign affairs minister by making him face the music when he goes to some internat-ional forum or engages in bilateral discussions.</para><para>The real reason that this bill is before us, and let us not get away from it, is the mess the government have made in closing down Cox Peninsula and then wanting to sell it but running the risk of finding that they might have sold it to somebody who would be unfavourable to Australia's national interest. If Cox Peninsula had not been closed, if Radio Australia had not been gutted, this bill would not be before us today. That is the shame of this bill: that it is totally the result of Senator Alston and this government's mad ideological obsession with destroying the ABC. What better proof than the events in the last week when we find that the biggest complainer about so-called ABC bias happens to be the federal director of the Liberal Party. He has sent 70 letters since 1996 to the ABC complaining about bias. I think the organisation with the next biggest number of complaints had two. Lynton Crosby must spend all his time listening to every ABC show across Australia and then writing a letter. But that is the obsession this government has about the ABC—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—The Nats like the ABC.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—I was waiting for you to interject, Senator McGauran. I knew you could not help yourself. I want to acknowledge that the National Party apparently have not been in league with Mr Crosby to complain about bias in the ABC. And the National Party would be nuts to complain about bias in the ABC, because when you get out to regional Australia and travel around you could never say that the National Party do not get a big run on regional ABC radio on any issue they wish to talk about, no matter what it is and on what program. They understand that they get a very good run. It is just a couple of ideologically obsessed Liberals, led by the Prime Minister, who have led this attack on the ABC, which has had the domino effect of our having this bill before us so that we can find a way in which we can sell Cox Peninsula without affecting the national interest. Again, the government has picked the wrong person. Although Senator Alston has clearly been found guilty of trying to wreck the ABC, he is still a better person to make that decision in the national interest, on advice from and in consultation with the foreign minister and others. Therefore, we strongly commend the amendments to the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>19973</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 22, page 14 (line 31), at the end of subsection 121FF(1), add:</para><para>	; or (d)	if the international broadcasting lic-en-ce applies to a transmission facility with the capacity to broadcast sim-ultaneously on more than three short-wave frequencies—the licensee must, at all times, make one shortwave signal on appropriate frequencies and bearings available to the ABC for the exclusive use of Radio Australia.</para><para> (2)	Schedule 1, item 22, page 15 (after line 5), after section 121FF, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">121FFA  Compensation—constitutional safety net</inline></para><para>	(1)	If:</para><para>	(a)	apart from this section, the operation of this Division would result in the ac-quisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms; and </para><para>	(b)	the acquisition would be invalid be-cause of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution;</para></quote><para>the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation of a reasonable amount to the person in respect of the acquisition.</para><quote><para>	(2)	If the Commonwealth and the person do not agree on the amount of the compensation, the person may institute proceedings in the Federal Court for the recovery from the Commonwealth of such reasonable amount of compensation as the court determines.</para><para>	(3)	In this section:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">acquisition of property</inline> has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">just terms</inline> has the same meaning as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.</para></quote><para>The amendments that the Democrats are moving today would require that, in the case of any international broadcasting licence when it applies to a transmission facility—and this would include Cox Peninsula and any other transmission facility that was built in Australia to these specifications—that has a capacity to broadcast simultaneously on more than three short-wave frequencies, the licensee `must, at all times, make one short-wave signal on appropriate frequencies and bearings available to the ABC for the exclusive use of Radio Australia'. I think at Cox Peninsula they have the capacity to broadcast on five; they used to broadcast on four and they left one as a standby in case one of the others went down, so they do have that capacity. In moving these amendments, I would like to quote Sir Robert Menzies.

He was so proud of it, and it is such a tragedy. What has happened to what was one of his great legacies is such a dishonour to the memory of Sir Robert Menzies.

This government did try to destroy it. I remember that plan A was: no more Radio Australia; it has gone. Plan B was: it can go out on satellite—and of course that was just ridiculous. Plan C: it can go out on short wave but not ours, somebody else's; we will give you a bit of money and you can go and try to find someone who will transmit it on short wave. They did find someone in Taiwan and, I think, in Singapore for some time. But of course it was not adequate: the number of languages that went out was not anywhere near the number it used to be when the service went out from Cox Peninsula. Now we are up to plan D, which is: we will give you a little bit of money because we have actually decided that it is an important service and you can do a bit with it. As to that bit that the ABC and Radio Aust-ralia want to do with it, one of the things in-volved will be transmitting from Cox Peninsula.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I should say that I have spoken to the new owners of Cox Peninsula and they are more than happy to put out Radio Australia on one of their bandwiths, one of their appropriate frequencies and bearings, for an appropriate price. I am sure they would be quite happy to live with these amendments. They would have no problem with them. There is a possibility that another broadcaster will be building a facility in northern Australia—not an Australian company, I understand—and I have been contacted by them as well. They are also happy with this. If they do decide to put in their transmission facility and they get an international broadcasting licence, they would also be more than happy to abide by what would happen if these amendments went through. </para><para>These are important amendments. As I said, they would mean that as long as the transmission facility at Cox Peninsula was available Radio Australia would always be able to go out from that facility, even if somebody else bought the facility or whether it was still the people who have bought it now. There is no problem according to the people who currently own the facility and there would be no problem according to a representative of the company who are considering building a similar facility also in northern Australia.</para><para>The really important thing about these amendments is that they would mean that Radio Australia could not be cut out of at least the Cox Peninsula facility as long as they had the money to pay an appropriate amount to get the signal on air. There is no problem with the people who currently own that facility. If they decide to sell that facility to someone else and new arrangements are made and if these amendments have gone through, those new arrangements would have to include the ability of the new licensee to put Radio Australia on air from Cox Peninsula. It is absolutely essential that Radio Australia has that capacity and has the certainty that they will always have available to them from Cox Peninsula, as long as the capacity is there to put out more than three signals, the ability to say, `We require that we are able to put out a short-wave signal on appropriate frequencies and bearings from this facility'—a facility that should never have been sold and taken away from Radio Australia. They are having to claw it back, and I think it is so important that they are able to use that facility. As I said, the current owners are more than happy for them to use it and they are currently negotiating, I understand, for that to happen. The important thing would be that every owner in the future would know that they would have to do the same negotiation with the ABC to put Radio Australia into the region that our parliament and our government believe is so important, so that the great legacy that Sir Robert Menzies started, to put this service from Australia into the region, would continue. I commend these to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>19975</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has been indicated, the opposition will not support these amendments although we have some sympathy, in principle, with what the Democrat amendments are trying to achieve. We believe that there are a number of practical aspects about contractual arrangements that may or may not be compromised by such amendments. I want to take this opportunity to further point out some of the difficulties that we are going to have in this licensing regime beyond the national interest. I point out that, as has been mentioned by Senator Bourne, the Cox Peninsula transmitter has been sold to a Christian broadcasting group, which I believe gave quite reasonable evidence to our committee. The question was put to them of how, as a Christian organisation, they would handle broadcasting messages into Asia, into countries that have an overwhelmingly non-Christian background and that follow religions such as Islam, variations of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism and other various subgroups of those major religious and/or cultural beliefs. There is no doubt that in some of those countries supporters of those religions would find what we would consider the most innocuous message in favour of Christianity somewhat offensive.</para></talk.start><para>As a supporter of free speech, I defend the right of the Christian group to give their mes-sage, but I also point out that some people in these countries with different cultural and religious backgrounds do not automatically accept the right of different religions to pro-mote their views, no matter how benign they may be. Appendix 3 of the report goes to the principles of transborder satellite television broadcasting in the Asia region as en-dor-sed by the Australian government. I under-stand from the note in the report from the gov-ernment that these would effectively be a code of practice for broadcasters such as the Christian group that has bought Cox Peninsula. In their own way, they cannot be argued with; they sound very reasonable to Australians in the Australian political culture. However, I am not sure that they would sound reasonable to some of the people with a zealot-like approach to supporting their religion.  </para><para>In recent times in Indonesia, we have unfortunately seen communal strife between different religious groups leading to people being killed in riots. We also know the unfortunate example of the Indian subcontinent where there is, from time to time, communal violence between different religious groups. I draw attention to the second dot point of these principles, which sounds very good:</para><quote><para>... recognising the global nature of transborder sat-ellite television broadcasting and acknowled-g-ing that transborder broadcasting has a purpose for the public good and the betterment of societies, offering benefits to communities through entertainment, information and education ...</para></quote><para>It sounds pretty innocuous to me, but I am not sure that we will not hear complaints against a religious broadcaster of any type from Australia acting under those guidelines. Others in our region might find them offensive. The third dot point goes on to say: </para><quote><para>... including safeguarding national cultures and traditional values from potential adverse effects ...</para></quote><para>At times Radio Australia was criticised, and TV Australia, when it was run by the ABC, was criticised for putting news and current affairs programs on air and broadcasting comments about which some countries in Asia complained, saying that they offended their national culture and traditional values. I have no doubt that even a benign and non-proselytising Christian program could be seen as offensive to other religious groups within Asia although they meet these guidelines, which have been apparently signed off in the Asia-Pacific region. I think that we have seen another outcome of the government's policy faults in this area. The problems are not going to be solved by this legislation; rather, we are going to have further difficulties. </para><para>I will watch with interest how many organisations from other countries with a different cultural background from Australia will make application to have a transmitter service from Australia, knowing that Australia, with our stable political and economic environment, is the best place to put such a transmitter. For example, I ask: would we let the American government, with its broadcasting services—which makes no bones about the fact that they proselytise a particular view; Radio Free America, for example, or variations thereof—broadcast from Australia? If the British government—a former colonial power in the region—wanted to have the BBC Overseas Service broadcast from Australia, would we allow it? If the German overseas broadcasting service or the French overseas service—countries with which we have good and friendly relations—wanted to have a licence, would we allow it in the national interest? Sooner or later, I would not be surprised if one of them takes the view that it is safer to build a transmitter in Australia than attempt to negotiate a place for a transmitter in Asia without the same long-term guarantees, security and safeguards. It will be very interesting if the Australian government says, `We have an ANZUS arrangement with America. We will let the Americans have a broadcasting facility for one of the services of the American government.' </para><para>Once we say yes to that, how do we differentiate to say no to the British, the French, the Germans or the Italians, if we want to? Then, if we say yes to the Christian group, do we automatically have to say yes to an Islamic group, a Hindu group or a Buddhist group? Once we say yes to one and no to the other, we are on the treadmill for an endless round of difficulty. The government has not thought this through—the outcome of what they did to Cox Peninsula. What they have sown here over the last couple of years they may not reap in the final 12 months of their government. Unfortunately, I suspect we in government in 12 months time will have some difficulty dealing with this issue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—You wish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—You laugh, Senator Calvert.

We are now left with this unsatisfactory bill, even though Senator Bourne has attempted to make some arrangement to help Radio Australia with the Cox Peninsula transmitter. That is a bit like putting a very small bandaid on the gaping hole in the side of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline>, which is the equivalent of this government's radio broadcasting policy and what they have done to Radio Australia.

Senator Schacht said that the reason the opposition was not agreeing to my amendments was due to two things: commercial arrangements may or may not be compromised by such amendments; and, secondly—I am paraphrasing here with this <inline font-style="italic">Titanic </inline>illusion—it is such a small assistance.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—A bandaid.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name></talker><para>—A bandaid on the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline>, yes—it is such a small assistance that it is not worth doing. A couple of things can be said about that. First of all, the only commercial arrangement it could possibly affect would be the one with the broadcaster who have already bought the equipment at Cox Peninsula, who tell me they want a licence. They are not worried about it. They are leasing the space to Radio Australia anyway and are entering into commercial arrangements with them. It is not a problem. So if that is your problem, it is not one. Extending on that, if another broadcaster, with either the Cox Peninsula facility or another facility which could broadcast simultaneously more than three signals into the region, and another licensee, who does not exist at the moment, were to acquire that licence, then they would know that along with that licence they would have to make available to the ABC the facility to broadcast, on an appropriate frequency and bandwidth, Radio Australia's signal. It is not a problem with the current owner of that equipment. If that is your problem with the amendments, you do not have a problem. There is no problem with the amendments. It does not affect that.

The problem would come in the future, and this would solve the problem in the future. If a future licensee has available to them the capability to put out more than three signals, then they would have to make available to the ABC one of those signal capabilities. It is not a problem at the moment. It makes Cox Peninsula available to Radio Australia forever, as long as it is in this act. I think that is terribly important.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the current licensee is happy to have Radio Australia—it is, in fact, currently communicating with Radio Australia, and I understand they are hoping and intending to come to an arrangement with them where they can put out the signal—then the question is about future licensees. I think it is very important that, when this bill becomes part of the act, it has in it that any future licensee would have to make available to Radio Australia the ability to put out one signal from Cox Peninsula. I think that is very important. That is what this amendment would achieve. Senator Schacht also made the comment about the amendment being a small bandaid. The thing about Radio Australia is that it is not dead. It is amazing that it is not dead. This government has tried so hard to kill it and it is not dead. In 1996 Radio Australia received $13.5 million from the ABC's budget. That was for program production, administration and satellite transmission. It had 144 staff and it produced programs in English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai, Indonesian, French and Tok Pisin or pidgin. A year later, in 1997, it had less than half of that operational budget. It had $6.3 million. Of course, it had to slash everything. The government was desperately trying to get rid of it, and it did not.  </para><para>Radio Australia is a magnificent service. It is a service which has been praised by committee after committee of this parliament: the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and various Senate committees, including the committee which specifically looked into this bill. Senator Schacht and I were members of several of those committees. I will quote from the Senate inquiry which resulted from the attack on Radio Australia and Australia TV. It found that:</para><quote><para>The broad aspects of international broadcasting cannot be valued in dollars and cents. It is about the subtle messages conveyed to the peoples of the region about life in Australia. It is about creating an awareness of Australia, an understanding of our way of life and the multicultural nature of our society. It is also about programming which draws attention to things which relate specifically to trade, business, education, tourism or diplomacy from which Australia might benefit directly as a result of those broadcasts.</para></quote><para>It is so important that Radio Australia goes out into our region. At the moment it goes out into the Pacific. We are sending it out from Shepparton in Victoria and Brandon in Queensland, and it is getting out to most of the Pacific. But it is not getting out to the amount of Asia that it used to, and it will not unless it goes out from Cox Peninsula or unless a lot more money is given to it to boost the signals from other places. It goes out for a couple of hours a day. I do not know if Singapore is finished now or if Taiwan is finished now—it may be. Asia is very underused by Radio Australia, and it should not be. This is a huge part of our region. Radio Australia can be heard in the Pacific, and there are far fewer people in the Pacific. It is not that they are not important—they are. It is important that Radio Australia gets out to those people, that they have a feel for Australia and that they get accurate news and current affairs about what is going on in their region. But it is equally important, if not more important, that Radio Australia also goes out to our Asian neighbours. </para><para>It is absolutely essential that our Asian neighbours get an accurate picture of Australia. During the problems with East Timor it was being reported by Antara, the official Indonesian newsagency, that our soldiers in INTERFET in East Timor were doing absolutely dreadful things, which of course they did not do. But the official Indonesian newsagency was saying that they did. The problem was that at that stage in Jakarta you could not get Radio Australia. Nobody knew what the truth was—it sure wasn't being broadcast from anybody in Indonesia or around there. The only place the truth was going to be broadcast from was Australia, and it was not because it was not getting as far west as that. It is absolutely vital that we do everything we possibly can to get the Radio Australia service into as much of our region as possible, and that has to include Asia. One of the ways to do that is to go from Cox Peninsula. There is no problem with the current owners of the equipment. They are currently negotiating with the ABC. The problem would come with future licensees who may build facilities, and I understand one is looking at that at the moment. That is where the problem will come. We need to say to those people that it is in our law that, if you own a facility in Australia and you have an international broadcasting licence, you are required under that licence to make available one signal to Radio Australia to get out into the region. It is really important that we do that. So I cannot accept either of the reasons that Senator Schacht gave for not agreeing to this amendment. I do not think that they are real reasons, and I do not think that it is the problem he thinks it is.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>19978</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is appropriate that I make it clear to all honourable senators why the government does not support the amendment. I think, in a way, Senator Bourne would agree with us. Firstly—and there is no disagreement over this—the ABC are certainly making arrangements with the new owners of Cox Peninsula, so Senator Bourne would not envisage a problem in the near term. The honourable senator did say that we were giving the ABC only a small amount of money. It is in fact $9 million over three years. When you are in Canberra dealing in billions of dollars, granting $9 million in the budget does not seem like much. But it is a lot of money. If you want to spend $9 million, you have to raise it in taxes. I remind people that, when they start thinking about spending millions of dollars, they should walk through the suburbs of Thornlie, Leederville or anywhere like that and figure out how many doors they would have to knock on—asking the people to contribute their entire annual income tax—to collect $9 million. You would have to visit a lot of houses to collect $9 million in taxes, so we should not say that $9 million is a small amount of money. One of the problems with Canberra is that you write cheques willy-nilly—with gay abandon. </para></talk.start><para>I say that in relation to the Democrat amendment because the government has ensured that the ABC has supplementary funding of $9 million to ensure that Radio Australia can transmit services into Australia. There are technical and legal defects in the amendment—specifically, the way the amendment is framed any future holder of an international broadcast licence would be required to reserve one out of three channels for the ABC. The amendment wrongly assumes that the holder of an international broadcasting licence owns and operates the related transmission facility. There may be a number of international broadcasters using a particular transmission facility, and each such broadcaster would be required to carry the Radio Australia signal and to make a channel available for exclusive use by Radio Australia regardless of whether they had the capacity to do so.</para><para>The other thing that could happen as a result of this amendment is that potential holders of IBLs would arrange their affairs to ensure they got around this legislative requirement—so, instead of having a facility, if they had the potential to broadcast three different signals they would have licences that allowed them to broadcast two as a way of getting around it. We think that the regime that we are putting in place will allow the ABC and Radio Australia to broadcast. As I said in my response to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Bishop, we would welcome hearing what the Australian Labor Party will do to ABC funding. We would welcome a commitment from them. They have made no commitments in relation to what they will do on any matter. They have opposed every expenditure cutting measure this government has made, so one would assume that they would return the budget to deficit almost overnight. They criticise us in relation to ABC funding and decisions on Radio Australia. At least Senator Schacht has had the guts to get up here and say what he thinks about it. Does Senator Schacht speak on behalf of the ALP? Will Senator Schacht indeed make a commitment to the funding of Radio Australia? Will he return it to 1986 levels or to 1990 levels? Will he return it to the levels that it was at before the Keating government started to cut its expenditure? Will the Labor Party make a commitment? They are the reasons I say to my colleague Senator Bourne that we think this amendment, although clearly honourably intentioned in relation to Radio Australia, will adversely affect the potential of international broadcasters basing themselves in Australia.</para><para>Although Senator Schacht makes a range of interesting hypotheses about what could occur—and I think they are legitimate hypotheses about international broadcast space in Australia—and although I am aware of a number of proposals to base the broadcasters out of Australia, I would have thought that, generally speaking, it is a good industry to have based in Australia. I know that in the north of Western Australia, my home state, there are proposals by some proponents to set up transmitting facilities. I would have thought it is a good industry to have based in Australia, and I would have thought an international broadcasting regime would be conducive not only to helping Radio Australia with their efforts into the region but also to a range of other diverse broadcasting operations. This legislation should facilitate that and should be encouraged. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>19980</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to say a few things on this amendment. Bizarrely, I might say, I will reject some of the propositions put by the government but will not support this amendment which has been advanced by the Australian Democrats. It is an awkward position, to be quite frank, because the views expressed by Senator Bourne about Australia's increasing alienation from Asia are absolutely right. She is right on that point. In fact, we are becoming knitted out of the Asian presence—overlooked and forgotten. I say that with some considerable passion because, having been in the region just recently, that point was driven home to me. There is every reason why Australia's presence should be made more manifest, and there is every reason why the national broadcaster should be adequately serviced in order to deliver a quality signal to Asia both in radio and in television and to at least have a presence by virtue of the capacity of the ABC to broadcast Australian culture, Australian sport and Australian drama to the region not to mention the ABC's high quality news service.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bourne is quite right to say all those things, because they are true. We will ultimately pay a massive economic penalty if the current drift in our relationship with Asia continues. It will be a penalty that each of us will have to bear, and the penalty will be alienation from our region. From that point of view, there is considerable sympathy for the aspirations behind the amendment. I do not agree, either, with the zero sum game that the government puts—that a consequence of this amendment, if it were to carry, increases expenditure. You do not have to knock on every door of every house in Thornlie or anywhere else to raise extra revenue; you can make savings in the Commonwealth budget to do so. In comparison with the size of the overall budget allocation, we are not talking about massive amounts.</para><para>One of the problems with making savings is that the Commonwealth budget has been shaved down, and we do have a massive bill in rolling back parts of the GST where we can effectively do that. But there are savings that could be made, and accommodations could be made to find the funding. In any case, that should be one of the targets of a government. But the problem that I see here—and the reason, in part, that we do not support the amendment—is that, in the explanatory terms that have been given to us, as well-motivated as the amendment is, it is fundamentally misdirected in operational terms. What we are hearing in support of the amendment is a cry from the heart, and a genuine one—one in which I join and share—about the way in which this government has allowed the ABC to be run down, the way in which this government has undermined the ABC, and the way in which this government has selected a board—and, through the board, a general manager has been appointed who is committed to marginalising the ABC. So the only question left is: why not privatise it? That is the direction in which things are now going.</para><para>I think that is a lamentable outcome, and I am part of any criticism that makes that point about the government. We need a genuinely independent, properly funded international broadcaster which is able to provide an independent service; which is able to reflect Australian cultural mores; which is able to deliver services across a range of areas; and which is able to reflect our unique national culture in drama, sport, news and in a range of other services.</para><para>The misdirection that I see here is driven by a laudable motive. We are overreaching ourselves, if this amendment were to be adopted, in the technical terms. I say that for several reasons. The first reason is that it is clear, from what we all know and from what has been agreed by all speakers in this chamber, that there have been and are currently talks between the current licence holder and the ABC about fitting together a commercial relationship. Senator Bourne has emphasised in her remarks that the current licence holder has no objections to this and may even welcome that type of presence. I am not in a position to be so bold as to say that, but that is certainly an implication. Indeed, the government says something similar. I think it is appropriate that those negotiations be concluded. Senator Bourne's concerns would then be, `But if at some future time the business is to be sold, then the commitments entered into commercially would not necessarily be transmitted to the new owner.' I do not know if that is true or not. I certainly think that an entity that has taken on an even more commercial hue, like the ABC, would want, in any negotiations, to reflect some longer term stability for itself, to guard against the vicissitudes of commercial life and to negotiate some sort of transmittal provision in its own right in any case.  </para><para>Why would the parliament want to stand between the commercial partners at this point when their processes are inconclusive and while there is still some distance to travel? I do not see that it is appropriate that the parliament should stand between the commercial partners in that respect. One would hope that, given the remarks that have been made and the force of support for those remarks by several speakers in this chamber tonight, there will at least be a ready understanding that there is a predisposition to see such an outcome achieved at a commercial level. </para><para>I think it is appropriate that we not carry this amendment. It is appropriate that we note the current status of the debate, that we note the current processes that are being conducted at a commercial level and that we respect those processes accordingly and hope that they will reach a conclusion. I do not think it is appropriate that we should intervene legislatively in what would be, frankly, a heavy-handed manner and impose on those parties an outcome which, if the government is accurate in reflecting the technical elements of that outcome, may not achieve all of the intentions in the laudable way in which this amendment aspires to achieve them in any case.</para><para>My advice is that the ABC, for their own part, hold the view that they believe that they can successfully renegotiate a commercial contract with the Christian broadcasters for use of the transmission capacity on Cox Peninsula. If that is true—and that is the advice I have, and it is strongly grounded advice—that is another reason to be cautious here. The exercise of this sort of parliamentary prerogative should be rare and should occur only in circumstances that are quite blatant. You would not say that is the situation here. The ABC, speaking for themselves, believe that it is possible to conclude a commercial arrangement. In short, the must-carry amendment that the Democrats have proposed is understandable but, in the circumstances, should not carry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>19981</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would just like to answer some of the things that have been said by the last two speakers. Senator Campbell does tend to get carried away on occasion. He did mention $9 million over three years and, as Senator Cook has just said, `Whose door are you going to knock on,' to get that $3 million a year. If you knock on every Australian door and ask for that $3 million a year from every Australian, the cost would be 16c per person per year. In the greater scheme of the budget, that is extremely small. That is very, very little. That is 16c per person per year. He said that this would take away one in three facilities to broadcast. It would not. It says at least three, so it would be one in four facilities to broadcast. He said that the licensee who is transmitting may not be the licensee who is broadcasting. That is true, but I understood under this bill that the government had accepted the committee's suggestion that there be two different types of licensees: a transmission licensee and a broadcasting licensee. I think it is in there. It is obvious from the amendment that we are only talking about transmission. The amendment states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... if the international broadcasting licence applies to a transmission facility with the capacity to broadcast simultaneously on more than three shortwave frequencies—the licensee must, at all times ...</para></quote><para>That is the transmission licensee, obviously, because we are talking about the transmission facility. So that is not really a problem. Senator Cook went on to say a couple of things. He believes that the ABC can successfully negotiate a commercial arrangement with the current owners of Cox Peninsula. I agree. I think that is exactly right. I do not think that is the problem. As I said, the future is the problem. As Senator Campbell said, there is a possibility at the moment of another licensee building a facility in Western Australia—and I have been told about that as well. That licensee is considering what sort of capacity they will have. If they have a capacity of more than three signals, they are happy to negotiate also with the ABC to make one of the more than three signals available to the ABC for Radio Australia. Senator Cook said that he did not think the parliament should stand between commercial partners—it is not. I do not believe that this is the case at all. I think all that this amendment would do, if it were passed—I still have hopes that it will be passed—is back up what they are doing. It would not stand between anybody. I really do not think there is a problem with that. On the other hand, I can see it is 10 past 10 and there a lot of people who do not really want to be here for very much longer. I still hope that this can be carried, and I look forward to winning this vote. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>19982</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In listening to the various contributions by Senator Bourne from the Democrats and my colleagues from the Labor Party to this debate and the ongoing issue of Radio Australia and its ability to transmit out of this country into our immediate geographic neighbourhood, I and others have had to consider what it is that is so important about Radio Australia and why it is that both the opposition and the Democrats have made lengthy contributions this evening and at other times on what they believe to be a most critical and wrong decision by this government in the area of funding cuts. Radio Australia and its transmission facilities at Cox Peninsula is like any other asset, I suppose. It comprises people, the markets it broadcasts into and the capacity or product it attempts to deliver into that particular region of the world.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, the people are obvious assets. The technicians, producers, various reporters, correspondents and, deriving from them, the various experts they rely on for advice on a range of topical and usually public issues, and the contacts they have developed over time, all add value to their reporting of our immediate area. That probably goes with any broadcasting medium. But in the form of a public broadcaster, which broadcasts into an area of the world that is becoming increasingly difficult for this nation to live and engage in, that corporate knowledge in the organisation, the expertise and the history built up within those people over a period of many years is increasingly invaluable. So it is not just the technical expertise of the technicians, producers and so on—who can be hired, rehired and trained and who can move fairly well within both public and private industry, but the expertise and the value they bring to Radio Australia and the knowledge they bring to their tasks and their job—but their expertise, their history, their contacts, their ability to get into areas that ordinary arms of government or ordinary agents of the government may not be able to get into that adds value to that organisation. We, in the opposition, regard that as being something of real value and worthy of ongoing significant funding to maintain in the public area.</para><para>The second core asset of Radio Australia, after its people and the corporate knowledge they bring, is the markets that organisation broadcasts into. Senator Bourne has outlined in previous debates that it has been broadcasting since some time in the late 1940s or early 1950s. It started out with broadcasts only into Indonesia, which was going through a revolutionary period at that time, and then to Singapore and Malaysia, which I think was its limit. Over the next 40 or 50 years, it developed extra capacity and went further north, and east and west into China and India—both countries impact on Australia in a major way now and will increasingly do so over the next 20 years—and then further east into the Pacific Islands and as far north in the Pacific to Hawaii, a state of the United States. That little geographical run-down has no value in itself; it is the message that is sent by Radio Australia that is important. The elites and governments in those areas hear the values that this nation holds dear and critical. Expatriate Australians who live and do business in those areas are always interested in an Australian perspective that comes from a public broadcaster as opposed to a perspective that might come from a commercial broadcaster seeking to derive profit. I think somewhat more important to the ordinary people, the ordinary citizens, of those countries—most of whom have lived under what can at best be described as rather unpleasant authoritarian regimes for many years—is that the message they have received from their own governments has often been one of lies and misinformation while the messages they have received from broadcasts from the BBC out of the United Kingdom via its relayers and from Radio Australia have allowed them to be well-informed of developments in this part of the world and to perhaps make some sort of comparison or analysis of the messages they receive from broadcasting facilities in their own country. </para><para>The product that is going to those areas is the news, the documentaries, the information about Australia, the views that this country holds and wishes to transmit and broadcast about itself and, more importantly and more critically, the views this country might hold on particular events or discussions or issues or developments that are occurring right throughout the Pacific islands across into East Asia and to South Asia. Instead of just receiving the message of a one-party state or the government of a state, when you receive news or information broadcast from Radio Australia you receive not just the view of the government of the day or the opposition of the day or a particular politician of the moment who might be being broadcast; you receive in totality the diversity of views on a range of issues that comes out of this country. On nearly every issue that is topical or public or in the domain for debate, there are a diversity of views. People have differing views, often dearly held, and that diversity of viewpoint is what is important to put out into Asia for those ordinary people as well as elites in governments to listen to and hear and have regard to. It is worthwhile to put on the public record why the opposition hold dearly to Radio Australia and why we hold dearly to the ability to broadcast in an ongoing well-funded, well-organised way to the countries in our immediate area. It relates back to those things I identified—the people involved in the organisation, the markets that it serves and its capacity to deliver the product that it has.</para><para>Turning to the instant debate and the amendments moved by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats: I do not want to go into them in detail, because Senator Cook has foreshadowed the position of the opposition. We have some sympathy for the aim of the Democrats in this debate but when the vote is called we will oppose the Democrats amendments. We will oppose them for three reasons: firstly, for the reasons stated by the government—we have listened to those reasons and we are attracted to their intrinsic sense; secondly, we do not know the consequences of amendments for commercial arrangements entered into by the government with Christian Broadcasters for Cox Peninsula; and, thirdly, the ABC has advised the opposition that they can successfully negotiate a commercial arrangement with Christian Broadcasters for the use of the transmission facility on Cox Peninsula. It was important to put on the record that that is the thinking of the opposition.</para><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para><para>Amendments (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—proposed:</para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 1 (line 17), omit "This Act", substitute "Subject to this section, this Act".</para><para>(2)	Clause 2, page 1 (after line 18), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	(2)	Schedule 2 commences immediately after the commencement of item 140 of Schedule 1 to the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000</inline>.</para><para>(3)	Clause 3, page 2 (line 2), omit "Each Act", substitute "Subject to section 2, each Act".</para><para>(4)	Page 33 (after line 35), at the end of the Bill, add:</para></quote><para>Schedule 2<inline font-weight="bold">—</inline>Designated teletext services</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1  Paragraph 6(3)(k) of Schedule 4</inline></para><para>Omit all the words after "the purpose", substitute:</para><para>		of the transmission of either or both of the following:</para><para>	(i)	datacasting services provided under, and in accordance with the conditions of, datacasting licences; </para><para>	(ii)	designated teletext services;</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2  Clause 49 of Schedule 6 (note)</inline></para><para>Omit "Note", substitute "Note 1".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">3  At the end of clause 49 of Schedule 6 (after the note)</inline></para><para>Add:</para></quote><para>Note 2:	For exemptions for designated teletext services, see clause 51A.</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">4  Clause 50 of Schedule 6 (note)</inline></para><para>Omit "Note", substitute "Note 1".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">5  At the end of clause 50 of Schedule 6 (after the note)</inline></para><para>Add:</para></quote><para>Note 2:	For exemptions for designated teletext services, see clause 51A.</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">6  After clause 51 of Schedule 6</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">51A</inline><inline font-weight="bold">  Exemption for designated teletext services</inline></para><para>		Clauses 49 and 50 do not apply to the provision of a designated teletext service (within the meaning of Schedule 4).</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Radiocommunications Act 1992</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">7  Section 5</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">designated teletext service</inline> has the same meaning as in Schedule 4 to the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</inline>.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">8  Subsection 102(5)</inline></para><para>Omit all the words after "has no effect", substitute:</para></quote><para>unless:</para><quote><para>	(a)	the licensee holds a BSA datacasting licence authorising the provision of that service; or</para><para>	(b)	the service is a designated teletext service.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">9  Subsection 102(6)</inline></para><para>After "other than a test transmission" (first occurring), insert "or a transmission of a designated teletext service".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">10  Subsection 102A(5)</inline></para><para>Omit all the words after "has no effect", substitute:</para></quote><para>unless:</para><quote><para>	(a)	the licensee holds a BSA datacasting licence authorising the provision of that service; or</para><para>	(b)	the service is a designated teletext service.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">11  Subsection 102A(6)</inline></para><para>After "other than a test transmission" (first occurring), insert "or a transmission of a designated teletext service".</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>19984</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that lengthy explanation of the government amendments!

In fact I thought that they had been fixed up when the bill went through. As far as I know, they relate to Channel 7 being able to keep running its teletext service, not as part of its datacasting service but just running its teletext service as it does. I imagine that that would then metamorphose in some way when the datacasting starts into a datacasting service and that they would do everything they have to under the bill when that happens. This is a service they have been running for years now, and it seemed reasonable to us at the time when the original bill was going through that they should be able to keep running it until they get into their real datacasting service. It seems reasonable to us now. We have had a look through the amendments and they do seem to be the same amendments that we had expected to go through with the bill, so we will be supporting them as well.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para><para>Bill, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>19985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) proposed:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>19985</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to place on the record that the opposition, its amendments having failed, will vote against the third reading but, it being a late hour, will not divide and will not oppose the Senate's message in the House.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>19985</page.no><id.no>S261</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>19985</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 30 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>19985</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>The <inline ref="S261">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline> has been the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The minority report by ALP senators outlines areas of potential concern with the provisions of the bill that were raised during the inquiry process. Criticisms of the bill contained in submissions to the inquiry have been noted by Labor senators. Those criticisms relate to the following issues: (a) the bill does not address the issue of existing domain name registries being monopolies; (b) the bill does nothing to ensure competitive pricing; (c) competitive pressures will adequately regulate domain name allocation and naming policy, and consequently there is no need for this legislation; (d) the existence of the bill's safety net measures might undermine the cooperative self-regulatory process; (e) the role of the ACA in managing electronic addressing and the clarity with which the circumstances for invoking the safety net measures are defined.</para></talk.start><para>I will discuss each of these criticisms in turn but, first, a brief description of the bill's provisions and the context of the bill's introduction is warranted. The bill provides safety net mechanisms for the management of electronic addressing through the Australian Communications Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. These safety net mechanisms are designed to be invoked in the event that attempts at self-regulation prove ineffective in managing electronic addressing. The government has indicated that it favours industry self-regulation for the management of electronic addressing services, which includes domain name allocation. Consultative processes for the formulation of a self-regulatory regime are presently being undertaken by au Domain Administration or auDA, which is an industry self-regulatory body for the au namespace. It formed two panels to investigate self-regulatory approaches to competition issues and naming policy issues through industry and public consultative processes. However, attempts at industry self-regulation over the last few years have consistently broken down or failed for various reasons. The provisions of this bill are intended to operate in the case of continuing failure of self-regulatory processes.</para><para>In response to a question I asked at the public hearing of the committee, Melbourne IT indicated that it has paid auDA $659,000 this financial year, pursuant to an agreement signed on 12 July 2000. auDA has stated that this financial support will enable it to continue to carry out its policy development role, and to continue with the Competition Model Advisory Panel process to introduce competition in the provision of domain names in au. The opposition will continue to observe these processes and their outcomes with interest.</para><para>The safety net mechanisms in this bill have the wide support of industry and government. This was evident from the absence of industry objections to the bill when the inquiry was first advertised and the limited number of concerns expressed when the inquiry was subsequently readvertised and its time frame extended. The bill comprises two schedules which implement the safety net mechanisms. The first schedule specifies circumstances in which the ACCC or the ACA can intervene in the management of electronic addressing. The second schedule establishes an alternative mechanism by which the minister can give the ACA responsibility for managing a specified type of electronic addressing in consultation with the ACCC. This mechanism will only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where direct ACA management is the only viable alternative to management by a self-regulatory body. </para><para>I will turn now to criticism (a) of the bill raised during the committee inquiry. The criticism is that this bill does not overcome existing monopolies of domain name registries. The competition panel of auDA is presently working through competition issues so that they will be addressed by the self-regulatory scheme. It was argued that the legislation will not prevent anticompetitive conduct but that its existence could undermine the self-regulatory processes that ultimately aim to overcome such conduct. The effective monopolies of the existing domain name registries need to be addressed. A means by which there can be multiple registries for each of the domain name spaces needs to be established to allow a number of different companies to compete in the market. The wider competition policy in the United States, for example, allows many stakeholders to enter the market as a competitive domain name system. It was suggested to the committee that the US approach indicates that, at this stage, there are no operational threats to Internet domain name addressing which require—or justify—legislative intervention.</para><para>Turning to issue (b) identified during the inquiry: the criticism was that the bill does not resolve, nor does it seek to address, the issue of competitive pricing of domain names. There is a close connection between competitive pricing and competition between domain name registries. As I have already mentioned, each second-level domain in Australia is an effective monopoly. The committee was advised that competition in pricing is contingent on there being future competition between registries. According to Melbourne IT, the high price of registering domain names in Australia compared to US prices is a result of the complexity of Australian naming policy which requires a lot of manual administration. Thus, the complexity of the regulatory environment in terms of naming policy is determinative of the price to the extent that it impacts upon the cost of providing the service. Consequently, in the United States, where the system is fully automated and there is virtually no policy except that seven particular swearwords are unavailable, the cost ranges from as little as $5.99 into the hundreds of dollars. In Australia, .com.au retail prices are around $140. It is expected that the issue of competitive pricing will, to a large extent, be addressed by the implementation of a means for introducing competition to the provision of domain name services in Australia. The opposition will watch the development of this aspect of the regulatory scheme with interest.</para><para>The third criticism brought to the attention of the inquiry relates to the substance of domain name policies and competition issues. Industry favours the introduction of effective competition into the Australian market over regulatory policy for domain names which reflects that for business names. Ensuring there are multiple issuers of domain names and resultant competitive pressures is, according to industry, the more appropriate regulatory approach for domain names. Any analogy between company registration and domain name registration is considered inappropriate due to the global aspect of domain name policy. Domain name policy is not, however, a matter with which the bill is concerned. It will be an issue that the self-regulatory scheme will address based on the results of the relevant auDA panel investigations. Industry indicated support `for some degree of policy in .com.au' to promote consumer confidence when addressing companies in .com.au. </para><para>Debate interrupted. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>19986</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>19986</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled: </para><quote><para>Australia-Japan Foundation—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Australian Hearing Services (Australian Hearing)—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Australian National Railways Commission (Australia National)—Report for 1999-2000. </para><para>Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited (ARTC)—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Central Land Council—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Civil Aviation Safety Authority—Corporate plan for 2000-2001 to 2002-2003.</para><para>Commonwealth Electoral Act—2000 Redistribution into electoral divisions—Western Australia—Report, together with maps showing proposed boundaries and names and compact disc containing submissions and transcripts of proceedings.</para><para>Employment Advocate—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Health Services Australia Ltd (HSA)—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>National Standards Commission—Report for 1999-2000.</para><para>Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority—Report for 1999-2000.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>19987</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics Act—Proposal No. 16 of 2000.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>19988</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport and Regional Services Portfolio: Agency Boards</title><page.no>19988</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2202)</subtitle><id.no>2202</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>19988</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 4 May 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Do chairpersons of any boards that administer agencies within the Minister's portfolio receive any payments, or other allowances, in addition to those paid to other board members; if so: (a) what is the nature of these additional payments or allowances; and (b) how is the quantum of these additional payments determined.</para><para>	(2) On how many occasions since January 1998 have the above payments been varied, and in each case: (a) what was the reason for the variation; (b) who determined the quantum of the variation; and (c) what was the quantum of the variation.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>19988</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para></talk.start><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) </inline></para><para>	(1)	(a) The Board chairperson receives a higher level of remuneration than is paid to Board members—$51,600 per annum for the Chair, $21,700 per annum for members.

employment participation or engagement in activities which enhance longer term employment prospects for young people in rural and remote locations, and how this is perceived by the young people and their parents; (2) assess the role of specific strategies introduced under Youth Allowance to assist and encourage education, training and employment participation (Rent Assistance to students, Parental and Actual Means Tests, Under 18s measure, Prior Workforce Independence criteria and Flexible activity testing);(3) provide an understanding of the attitudes towards Mutual Obligation and Activity Test measures by Newstart Allowance &amp; Youth Allowance recipients and the general community; and(4) assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of specific aspects of Mutual Obligation and Activity Test measures  (Activity Test arrangements, Work for the Dole, access to employment services assistance, and the extent of activity test exemptions).</para></entry></row><row><entry

Instead Telstra has relied on its contractual right to cancel services which breach service providers' contracts with Telstra.  Service providers promise Telstra in their contracts that they will not provide telephone sex services in breach of Part 9A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.  Through monitoring of advertisements appearing in newspapers and magazines and complaints it received, Telstra considered that some service providers had breached that promise.  Telstra then exercised its contractual rights to cancel those services.  This is to protect Telstra's interests and to prevent illegal conduct.  These services were being provided in an unrestricted way (not on the restricted 1901 number range) thereby making them accessible to children.</para><para>	(2) Telstra advises that Mallesons Stephen Jaques (MSJ) is one of the legal firms that they employ and has been instructed to write to several sex service providers informing them of the action Telstra was taking in relation to the service providers' breach of contract.  In addition, in cases where Telstra had grounds to suspect that the service provider had breached the contract by providing illegal telephone sex services, MSJ was instructed to write to service providers demanding an explanation.  Telstra advises that MSJ was acting on Telstra's behalf in Telstra's interests.</para><para>	(3) No. Telstra advises that the initial letters simply gave details of the numbers in question and the action Telstra proposed to take under the contract.  Some service providers responded by asking for evidence.  Telstra provided them with copies of the contemporaneous notes of the conversations that led to Telstra's view that the relevant services breached the legislation and the service provider's contract.  In addition, in some cases where an initial letter was sent requesting an explanation because Telstra suspected that the services might breach the legislation, Telstra later formed the view that the services did breach the legislation and enclosed the relevant notes of the conversations with a subsequent letter informing the service provider of the cancellation of the relevant service.</para><para>	(4) The definition of a 'telephone sex service' in the legislation requires that both the advertising and the content of a service be taken into account in forming a view as to whether a particular service is a 'telephone sex service' or not.  Telstra has advised that it therefore had to call these services to see whether the providers did, in fact, engage in the sexually explicit conversation suggested by the advertising discovered in Telstra's routine monitoring of newspapers and magazines.  To do this, Telstra did authorise the hiring of persons to call the services suspected of breaching the legislation and contractual obligations to Telstra. </para><para>	The legislation makes Telstra automatically liable to fines of up to $250,000 every time a telephone sex service is made by one of its customers and charged for on one of Telstra's bills.  The only defence is if Telstra can show that it did not know the service was a telephone sex service and had exercised reasonable diligence in finding any telephone sex services that might be provided to its customers.  To exercise reasonable diligence, Telstra monitors magazines and newspapers where advertising for these types of services might appear, it has set up a complaints system and it has negotiated contracts with all service providers in which they must warrant that none of their services breach the legislation and that they will not engage in conduct which breaches the legislation.  In order to exercise reasonable diligence, and avoid exposure to penalties, Telstra must not be involved in those services it considers to be illegal telephone sex services.  But to decide whether a service is a telephone sex service, Telstra must call the service to form a view about the content.</para><para>	(5) The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 generally prohibits the interception of telecommunications, including adult telephone sex services and it applies to telecommunications carriers including Telstra.  However, Telstra considers it has acted within that legislation because no interception of a telephone communication has occurred and no electronic recording was conducted. </para><para>	(6) Not applicable based on the answer to question (5) above. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>People with Disabilities: Case Based Funding Trials</title><page.no>20038</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2880)</subtitle><id.no>2880</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20038</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 31 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to disability employment:</para><para>	(1) Have there been any preliminary reports concerning the Case Based Funding trials.</para><para>	(2) Have the last participants in the More Intensive Flexible Services (MIFS) pilot program completed their programs.</para><para>	(3) Over the years how much was allocated to this program and how much of that was administrative costs.</para><para>	(4) How many people did it assist in total.</para><para>	(5) What was the success rate of the program.</para><para>	(6) What was the average cost of each participant.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20038</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minster for Family and Community Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Since the Case Based Funding Trial commenced in November 1999, regular statistical reports on data from the trial have been posted on the Family and Community Services Internet site.

One criterion is the need for businesses to have a recognised industrial relations/human resource management system in place.  The presentation to interested parties provided a general overview of the industrial relations issues for businesses considering tendering for the project.  The OEA's part of the presentation and advertisement concentrated on those parts of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 for which the OEA has responsibility and where it has expertise, namely, Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) and freedom of association.  However, participants at the seminars were advised of all the options available to them, including awards and certified agreements. While ultimately it is a matter for the individual business to decide, there could be a number of benefits to parties making AWAs (whether on the Darwin-Alice rail project or in many other contexts).  These benefits include the ability to deal individually with employees, flexibility for both employers and employees, and the ability to monitor and reward high quality performance.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Electricity Market</title><page.no>20040</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2891)</subtitle><id.no>2891</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20040</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 31 August 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Is the use of a Net System Load Profile (NSLP) to deem electricity consumption regulated or covered in any way by the National Measurement Act 1960 (the Act); if so, how and with what implications for the use of NSLP.</para><para>	(2) Has the Minister's office been approached by the Victorian Government or any of its agencies in its role as jurisdictional panel member of the National Electricity Market, or otherwise, in relation to the use of net system load profiling for deeming electricity consumption; if so, when and for what purpose.</para><para>	(3) Has the Minister, or the department, had any contacts with the Victorian Government or any of its agencies about the Act in relation to full retail contestability in the gas or electricity markets; if so: (a) when were these contacts; (b) in what form were they; (c) who was involved; and (d) what issues were canvassed.</para><para>	(4) Has the Minister been approached by the National Electricity Market Management Company or the National Electricity Code Administrator about the use of NSLP for full retail contestability for electricity; if so, what issues were raised.</para><para>	(5) (a) What are the alternatives to NSLP for measuring electricity consumption so that full retail contestability can be introduced; (b) do they conform to the Act; and (c) what other advantages and disadvantages do they have.</para><para>	(6) Has anyone sought amendments to the Act in relation to the delivery of electricity or gas: if so, (a) who; (b) when; and (c) what changes did they seek.</para><para>	(7) Has the Minister's office or the Commonwealth Government given any undertakings to any other party about the administration of the Act in relation to the introduction of full retail contestability for electricity and/or gas; if so: (a) what were these undertakings; and (b) to whom and when were they given.</para><para>	(8) (a) How are consumer interests represented in decision-making processes for the national electricity market; (b) what information is available to the consumer; and (c) what resources are provided to enable consumer participation.</para><para>	(9) How is the Act monitored and enforced in the electricity and gas industries.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20041</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Minchin</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Application of the National Measurement Act 1960 to net system load profiling is unclear.

However, cost-effective interval metering solutions are not yet available and may take some time to develop.  Although concerns about cost and cost recovery may be addressed quickly, interval metering development and rollout has the capacity to significantly delay the implementation of full retail contestability.  </para><para>	The alternative approach of profiling involves developing sophisticated algorithms to estimate consumption.  Profiling solutions can range in complexity from net system profiles through to more complex customer class profiles.  Profiles can be developed on the basis of consumption/ load or cost.  Profiling could be implemented quickly and may be a relatively cheap alternative to interval metering.  However, profiling by its nature is less accurate than interval metering and may involve allocative cross-subsidies between users. </para><para>	Interval metering is consistent with the requirements of the National Measurement Act 1960.  Cost profiling is also likely to be consistent with the requirements of the National Measurement Act 1960.  My Department is currently in the process of establishing whether load profiling is consistent with the Act.</para><para>	(6) The Victorian and New South Wales Governments have sought clarification regarding the operation of the National Measurement Act 1960. They informally raised the possibility of amending the Act or developing regulations to clarify the legality of using profiling under the National Measurement Act 1960. At this stage no formal request has been received. </para><para>	(7) No undertakings, beyond a willingness to consider the issue, have been provided by the Commonwealth concerning the interrelationship between the National Measurement Act 1960 and the introduction of full retail competition in the electricity sector.</para><para>	(8) The Energy Action Group has represented consumer interests in relation to implementing full retail contestability through its membership on the National Electricity Market Settlements and Transfer Committee (NEMSAT).  NEMSAT is advising the NSW and Victorian governments on the implementation of full retail contestability, particularly as it relates to the development of systems and processes to facilitate customer choice.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is also an observer on this Committee. </para><para>	Consumer interests are protected in the National Electricity Market by provisions included in the National Electricity Code (Code) as well as licensing requirements in each jurisdiction.  The Code defines the rights and obligations of participants within the National Electricity Market.  All proposed changes to the Code must follow a well-defined Code change process that requires public notification of all proposals, as well as a public consultation process.  Any interested party may submit a proposal for a Code change as well as a submission on any proposed Code change.  Proposals for Code changes are considered by the National Electricity Code Administrator in the first instance and then may be referred to the ACCC for a final determination.  All submissions received through the public consultation process, as well as the final recommendations to the ACCC, are publicly available.  The ACCC considers the recommendations having regard to its previous determinations, the likely competition effects with regard to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the net public benefits of the proposal.</para><para>	The National Electricity Code Administrator launched a review of end-user advocacy in March 2000. Implementation of the recommendations from the review of end-user advocacy are expected in early 2001.  Issues to be covered by the review include:</para><para>	- Potential amendments to the Code to ensure effective opportunity for end-user involvement</para><para>	- Appropriate provision of information and the practices and procedures of NECA and NEMMCO to facilitate end-user advocacy.</para><para>	- Scope for improved organisational and representational arrangements on behalf of end users</para><para>	(9) As for all industries, the electricity industry interacts with the National Measurement Act 1960 through the validation and certification of meters used in the industry.

DETYA has issued for comment an exposure draft of the Code. Under the Code a provider will be able to participate in the provision of a course under an arrangement with a registered provider under sub-clause 8(1)(f) of the ESOS Bill 2000, though under paragraph 12.3 of the Code, only one provider will be permitted to be registered where a course is jointly provided. In the Wesley case, Wesley Mission did not inform the NSW Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Board (VETAB) of its agreement with Vision College before the joint venture began. If it had done so, VETAB would have been able to raise its objection about Vision's lack of Registered Training Organisation status at that stage. Paragraph 12.3 of the Code requires providers to get the approval of the State authority for arrangements to provide courses in association with other providers.</para><para>	Sections 22 and 24 of the ESOS Bill 2000 require registered providers to belong to a Tuition Assurance Scheme and to make payments to the ESOS Assurance Fund, unless regulations exempt them from these requirements. It is in the context of these regulations that the future of the Parent Organisation Guarantee (POG) comes to be considered. DETYA will consult in due course on those regulations, taking into account the fact that the Bill changes the context in which the POG was originally devised, and the experience of the Wesley case.</para><para>	Moreover, the strengthened provisions of the ESOS Bills will clarify responsibilities in situations such as the Wesley Institute/Vision College example, and expose registered providers to clear sanctions for any breaches of the Act or Code, whether committed by themselves or by an agent or sub-contracted provider.  </para><para>	Section 18 of the Bill provides that only the registered provider will be able to receive course money.  (In the Wesley Institute example, the sub-contracted body was accepting payments.) Breaches of this provision (as other provisions of the Bills and the National Code) will be able to be sanctioned. </para><para>	The registered provider will be responsible for compliance with the new ESOS Act and the requirements of the National Code. The National Code holds providers responsible for the activities of their agents, which is defined in the ESOS Bill as a person who represents or acts on behalf of a provider, or purports to do so.</para><para>	The draft National Code includes the requirement that advertising and information provided to prospective students must identify the registered provider and its CRICOS number, and identify any sub-contracting arrangements involved in the student's course. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Importation of New Zealand Apples</title><page.no>20044</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2940)</subtitle><id.no>2940</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20044</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 15 September 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Did the New Zealand application to import apples into Australia lodged in 1998 advise that the cold storage of apples removed the potential for the transfer of fireblight; if so:</para><para>	(a) what assessment of that claim was made by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; and</para><para>	(b) what was the result of any assessment.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20044</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) The New Zealand application included new research on the survival of fireblight on apples in cold storage.</para><para>	(a) AQIS staff specialists assessed these claims in consultation with several Australian fireblight specialists.</para><para>	(b) This research initially promised to show that the viability of bacteria on fruit is reduced by cold storage, but on further assessment it has proved inconclusive.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Sandfly Road, Margate, Tasmania</title><page.no>20044</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2946)</subtitle><id.no>2946</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20044</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 September 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) What was the cost of upgrading the `T' junction at Margate near the end of Sandfly Road in Tasmania.</para><para>	(2) How much did the Commonwealth contribute.</para><para>	(3) Who did the work and how much was each contractor paid.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20044</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) The Channel Highway/Sandfly Road junction was identified as a black spot site under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 and funding was provided in 1997/1998 under the Federal Road Safety Black Spot Program.

The Community Reference Group worked over a 6 month period with the Defence project team in identifying issues and development solutions;</para><para>	- a public meeting;</para><para>	- distribution of 5 newsletters to 15,000 residents surrounding the site with one incorporating a `reply paid' response to the proposed development concept;</para><para>	- workshops with Council staff;</para><para>	- presentations to the full Council;</para><para>	- site open days;</para><para>	- community workshop over a three day period;</para><para>	- issuing of all consultants reports to stakeholders and making such available at the Council Chambers and Library for public inspection; </para><para>	- briefing with individual stakeholders including Community Centre users (Steiner School);</para><para>	- public exhibition of development concept before finalisation and lodgment; and</para><para>	- briefing of local Members and/or their representatives.</para><para>	Following lodgment of Defence's Development Applications, Steiner School representatives were invited to a meeting in November 1999 to discuss their future.  At the conclusion of the meeting it was agreed, the Steiner School was to submit a proposal before the end of the year regarding their future on the Defence site.  Subsequent to the meeting, Steiner School representatives were followed up on a number of occasions (during February and March 2000) in regard to their proposed submission.  It was finally submitted in June 2000.  Various pieces of correspondence have transpired over the past six months and a further meeting was held with the Steiner School in August 2000.  The Steiner School also attended meetings with Community Centre users in November 1999 to discuss Defence's Development Applications and in June 2000 to discuss a number issues about the Community Centre and its future.</para><para>	(3) The department's development solution for the site has addressed the majority of community concerns and issues identified in one of the most extensive community consultation programs undertaken.  Particular issues that have been addressed are:</para><para>	- provision of a substantial new community facility specifically located in the northern portion of the site adjacent to open space, as requested by the community;</para><para>	- incorporation of a pre-school in the community facility;</para><para>	- provision of low-density development with no high rise.  In Defence's Development Applications, the number of dwellings contemplated for the site is at a lower rate than proposed throughout the rezoning community consultation program; and</para><para>	- restriction of north/south bound traffic through the site whilst being integrated with the surrounding street system.</para><para>The current proposal provides for some 12-13 hectare of open space representing approximately 25% of the site area.</para><para>	The entire planning process since 1996 has proceeded on the basis of seeking and incorporating community views on the disposal of Randwick.</para><para>	(4) A press release issued in October 1999 included an offer for the School to lease part of a site in the new development, anticipated to be adjacent to a proposed new community facility included in Defence's development application for the surplus land at Randwick.  Prior to December 1999, it was expected that the site would be ready for development at the end of 2000.  This will not occur, as there have been delays in progressing the disposal planning with Randwick City Council.  The offer was also dependent on the School providing a submission on its future plans and agreeing commercial terms.  The School was informed in November 1999, that any such arrangement would be short-term. </para><para>	There is a possibility some parents of the School may have misunderstood the offer made by Defence.  Nevertheless, it has been made clear to School officials since November 1999 that the offer reported in October 1999 was a temporary one and that the School would be ultimately responsible for its permanent location.  At that time, officials would have also been aware that there were no guarantees regarding its future tenure at Randwick. </para><para>	The School was advised in December 1999 that the current lease would not be renewed.  There are contamination issues associated with the existing site and pre-disposal activities need to be undertaken.  The School has been encouraged to address its future plans and despite many requests a submission was not provided until June 2000.  The fact that the School is expanding each year is an issue.  The submission, which sought a 49-year lease, did not provide the information required by the department.  The School has been advised of the inadequacy of its submission.  In the meantime, there have been delays in relation to Randwick Council's consideration of Defence's development applications and the subsequent requirement for a site Masterplan.  The opportunity to accommodate the School within the new development as originally envisaged has now passed. </para><para>	(5) See (4) above.</para><para>	(6) In order for the School to secure a future presence on the new site, the only means now available to achieve this would be to acquire a portion of the site when it is offered to the market or to negotiate an arrangement with any future purchaser of the site.  The present indications are that the marketing of the property will not occur until the middle of 2001 at the earliest. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Child Support: Parenting Orders</title><page.no>20047</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2952)</subtitle><id.no>2952</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20047</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 September 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) In a child custody disputation, is it possible for a non-custodial parent who has no criminal record to be denied access to his or her child or to have as little as 30 hours access in the 18 years of that offspring's childhood; if so, why.</para><para>	(2) Where court orders require a custodial parent to furnish a child's medical and school reports to the non-custodial parent but this is not done, what action is taken to have the court's requirement upheld, and, if no effective action is taken, why not.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20047</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) In proceedings for a parenting order, a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 may make such parenting order as it thinks proper (Section 65D).</para><para>	While it is possible that a court may make, under section 65D of the Act, an order that a parent is to have limited or no contact with their child, whether such an order is made is a matter for the court and will depend on the circumstances of the case.</para><para>	In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration (section 65E).</para><para>	The Act requires that a court, in determining what is in a child's best interests, must consider a number of matters relating to the child and his or her family situation, including any wishes the child has expressed and other matters relating to the child's particular circumstances (section 68F).</para><para>	(2) Orders made by courts under the Act are enforced by courts on application by those who have an interest in securing compliance with them.  An order made by a court under the Act requiring that documents be furnished by the parent with whom the child primarily lives to the child's other parent would usually be enforced on the application of that other parent.</para><para>	The range of sanctions available to the court under the Act include imprisonment, fines, recognizances, alternative sentencing options (for example, community service orders if available in the State or Territory where the court is sitting), sequestration of property and delivery of documents.  In addition, where such an application is made, the court may make such orders it considers necessary to ensure compliance with the order that was contravened.</para><para>	Enforcement of orders in relation to children's orders is a difficult issue and is often associated with communication difficulties between parents. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2000, introduced in the Senate on 3 October 2000 after its passage through the House of Representatives, proposes changes to the Family Law Act 1975 to improve the enforcement of parenting orders and to promote more effective communication between parents in the best interests of their children.  </para><para>	The Bill proposes a 3-tiered approach, recommended by the Family Law Council, involving:</para><para>	. preventative measures, to improve communication between separated parents and to educate them about their respective responsibilities in relation to their children;</para><para>	. remedial measures, to enable the parents to resolve issues of conflict about parenting; and</para><para>	. sanctions, to ensure that, as a last resort, a parent is punished for deliberate disregard of a court order. </para><para>	It is hoped that this new approach will assist parents to consider, avoid and resolve disputes relating to the upbringing of their children.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Shipping: Barge Sinking Incident</title><page.no>20048</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2958)</subtitle><id.no>2958</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>20048</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 28 September 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) Can the Minister confirm that a barge loaded with barrels of oil sank at Cocos Island in 2000;  if so, can the Minister guarantee that the barge was seaworthy, given that it was a World War II landing barge.</para><para>	(2) Was a permit issued to allow this vessel to operate loading and unloading cargo at Cocos Island;  if so, (a) by whom; and (b) what investigations were conducted to determine its seaworthiness prior to the permit being issued.</para><para>	(3) What action has been taken to recover the oil.</para><para>	(4) Will the Minister investigate the process by which this barge was allowed to operate.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>20048</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>	(1) An amphibious vehicle became partially submerged in the lagoon at Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 31 July 2000 while undertaking commercial operations ferrying cargo from a ship anchored offshore to the Island.
