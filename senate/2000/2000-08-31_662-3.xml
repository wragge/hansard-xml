During this time, the limit also applied to the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). It also applied to the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) from its commencement in 1994. It was not until March 1997, however, that any of these organisations formally expressed concern in relation to the contract provision. While regulations were made in June 1998 to increase the limit applying to the Family Court, the AAT and the NNTT to $1,000,000, regulations could not be made in respect of the High Court and the Federal Court until the relevant legislation had been amended to include. a standard regulation making power.</para><para>You also seek advice regarding the basis for choosing $1,000,000 as the new limit. In choosing this amount, the courts and the tribunals were consulted and, while a range of  limits was suggested, most support was for a limit of this order of magnitude. I also had regard to the nature and value of contracts that in recent years had required ministerial approval. Of these, no contract under $1,000,000 had been in any way contentious. After taking these matters into account, I concluded a limit of $1,000,000 would be appropriate. My colleague, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Hon John Fahey MP, was consulted in relation to the appropriateness of this amount and he indicated that he had no objections to the contract limit being raised to $1,000,000.</para><para>Finally, you seek advice regarding the nature of the contracts that may be entered into by the High Court and the Federal Court. Typically, contracts for which my approval has been sought by the courts and the tribunals relate to the fitout of premises and the purchase of services such as airline travel, records storage and management, telecommunications, court reporting and security.</para><para>I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee.</para><para>Yours sincerely </para><para>DARYL WILLIAMS</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>17033</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1 and 2 standing in my name for the next day of sitting for the disallowance of Civil Aviation Amendment Order (No. 2) 2000, made under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, and Civil Aviation Amendment Order (No. 4) 2000, made under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988.

Your letter was referred to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) for advice. I have now received CASA's response and am able to address the issues you raise. I regret the delay in replying.</para><para>The Committee has sought clarification as to why the fourth paragraph of the ES to Civil Aviation Amendment Order (No. 2) 2000 referred to subparagraph 4.1A(a), while the next paragraph referred to subparagraph 4.1A(d). CASA has advised that the capabilities that an automatic pilot must have are set out in subparagraphs 4.1A(d), (e) and (f). Therefore the reference to subparagraph 4.1A(a) in the ES should have been to subparagraph 4.1A(d). The error is regretted. However, the Order itself is correct.</para><para>The Committee also noted that the ES advised that the purpose of the Order was to insert a Note to clarify the effect of subparagraph 4.1A(d). The Committee advised that in such cases another legislative provision may be preferable to a Note. CASA has advised that the purpose of the Note was to dispel doubts as to whether autopilots that. maintained altitude by use of an accelerometer had “a capability to maintain flight and manoeuvre the aircraft about the roll and pitch axis” as required by subparagraph 4.1A(d). While the general consensus of operations and airworthiness specialists in CASA was that they did, some uncertainty existed within the aviation industry which needed to be dispelled. </para><para>In this instance, CASA considered that the most satisfactory means of reassuring the aviation industry about the effect of subparagraph 4.1A(d) was by means of a Note that addressed their particular concern, specifically for the following reasons. Firstly, the present wording of subparagraph 4.1A(d) was considered satisfactory and did not need amendment. Secondly, CASA was concerned that reference in the legislation to automatic pilots with a particular attribute as having the prescribed capability could lead to questions about the failure to refer to other types of automatic pilot.</para><para>In relation to Exemption No. CASA EX28/2000, the Committee questioned the reference in the ES to the instrument ceasing to have effect at the end of June while the Exemption refers to the end of July. CASA confirms that the Exemption is intended to cease having effect at the end of July as set out in the instrument itself. The discrepancy between the Exemption and the Explanatory Statement was unintentional.</para><para>Finally, in relation to Civil Aviation Orders (No. 2) and (No. 4) the Committee raised concerns that the making words of the Orders do not quote their source of authority. CASA has advised that in both cases, the sources of authority for making the Orders we're fully set out in the relevant Explanatory Statements. This is consistent with the practice followed when making Statutory Rules. While it is possible to include the authority for Orders in the making words of each specific Order, CASA believes that it is more appropriate to include those details in the Explanatory Statement accompanying each Order, particularly when some Orders rely on several different heads of power.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>JOHN ANDERSON</para><para>17 August 2000</para><para>The Hon John Anderson MP</para><para>Minister for Transport and Regional Services</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA   ACT   2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>Thank you for your letter dated 18 July 2000 concerning Civil Aviation Amendment Orders (Nos. 2 and 4) 2000 and Exemption No.CASA EX28/2000.

We believe that it is purely a political attack on the chairman of the panel that is doing the inquiry into telecommunications services. We believe that the information that is being sought by this motion is entirely inappropriate. It highlights the fact that, of the approximately 41 carriers registered with the Aust-ralian Communications Authority at the moment, there is only one carrier that could be subject to this sort of political interference by parliamentary process—that is, Telstra. It puts Telstra at a significant competitive disadvantage. It highlights the fact that the Com-monwealth remaining in majority ownership of Telstra puts it under constraints and anticompetitive pressures that are unfair to that organisation and constrict its growth and its potential to provide quality services, particularly to regional and remote parts of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the information that is being sought, if Labor seriously want to peruse the var-ious contracts entered into by Leighton and Telstra, they can do something quite simple. It may be beyond the capability of some people opposite, but all they need to do is look at an annual report. Details of all the contracts that Leighton is involved in are available in its annual reports. Indeed, if the honourable sena-tor who has moved the motion—or any other honourable senator—wants to do so, he can even visit the Leighton web site. It is on the World Wide Web. It is a new invention for the Labor Party—it is called the Internet. Leighton's information is up there, and they will be able to find it. For these reasons, we regard this as a crass pol-it-I-cal exercise. </para><para>We believe that Telstra have, in their answer to question No. 29 asked in the sup-plementary additional estimates round, provided all the information that is required. They have gone further and offered senators con-fidential briefings on all these matters. Any reasonable person knows that to seek the information that is being sought by this motion would significantly harm the commercial interests of Telstra, and that is something that Labor stand condemned for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>17036</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Senator Ian Campbell was correct in one of the points he made—that is, that Telstra is the only company with which the opposition is pursuing this issue of particular contracts or documents relating to commercial-in-confidence information. The opposition is not pursuing the same information in relation to the other 40 or 50 telcos that operate in Australia or around the world. The reason we pursue this information with Telstra does not relate to the allegations raised by Senator Ian Campbell; it is simply that Telstra is 51 per cent government owned. That is the sole justification, and the only necessary justification, for seeking this information. If we sought to inquire further into the matter, we would refer to the 1998 report of the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the issue of commercial-in-confidence documentation. It is becoming a recurring theme with a range of agencies that the opposition has to deal with that, every time the opposition make what we regard as a legitimate request for the tabling of material or information, we are told that the material in dispute is commercial-in-confidence and cannot or will not be tabled, or can be tabled on the proviso that it is made available only to members of a particular committee. </para></talk.start><para>If the opposition accepted such a proposition it would be unable to fulfil its obligation to inquire into a range of matters associated with the administration of a large public enterprise which is being set up to be privatised through an inquiry about which it can at best be said that there are some doubts as to the bona fides of the chairman, given his public record, his public statements and his public utterances as that inquiry has gone on the road. With those comments, there is no point in adding any further to this debate. I simply say that the opposition will inspect the relevant documentation, when tabled, with interest.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17037</page.no><id.no>R1106</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PROTECTION OF THE SEA (CIVIL LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1118</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>17037</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>17037</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

Policy bills should be specific. It is far better for a reformist government to deal with one issue at a time on a specific and limited basis.”</para><para>And again, in the course of the inquiry by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee into the bill, the Senator said, “It seems to me the Act can be conveniently broken up into major sectors ... I find these kind of omnibus bills result in a lot of negativity and it is very difficult to progress them.” </para><para>Taking these sentiments into account, the Government has sought to accommodate the preferences of the Australian Democrats by proceeding, other than on technical issues, with an issue by issue consideration of policy matters arising from the More Jobs Better Pay Bill 1999.</para><para>The first of these issue by issue bills was a bill dealing with pattern bargaining and related matters which passed the House on 1 June 2000, but which is now also being opposed in the Senate by the Labor Party and, so far, by the Democrats.</para><para>The Government is now in a position to introduce further single issue bills drawn from the More Jobs Better Pay Bill 1999.</para><para>This bill deals with secret ballots prior to the taking of protected industrial action.</para><para>Secret ballots provide a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees in an enterprise want to take industrial action. </para><para>Although Australia has long had provisions for secret ballots at the federal level, they have not been compulsory as a precondition to industrial action.  In the past this was not such an issue as prior to 1994 virtually all industrial action was unlawful.  </para><para>The Government believes it is appropriate, in view of the protections against civil liability for industrial action taken in pursuit of enterprise agreements provided by the Workplace Relations Act 1996, that secret ballots become a precondition to accessing protected action.  Extension of the existing scheme of secret ballots in this way would enhance freedom of choice, minimise unnecessary industrial action and strengthen the accountability and responsiveness of unions to their members.</para><para>Evidence from the UK where secret ballot provisions have been operating since 1984 - and were retained in the Blair Government's Employment Relations Act 1999 - shows that the introduction of legislative requirements for secret balloting has:</para><para>provided union members with a direct say in the authorisation of industrial action;</para><para>encouraged greater consultation by unions of their members;</para><para>in conjunction with other legislative reforms, helped to significantly reduce strike activity; and</para><para>had the support of UK trade union leaders.</para><para>The UK experience shows that secret ballots are about improving the way unions consult with their members and so reducing the likelihood of unnecessary and illegitimate industrial action.</para><para>This bill will enhance the opportunities for democratic participation by employees in making decisions about taking industrial action.  A more democratic process will enable the employees who are directly concerned to decide for themselves whether industrial action is warranted.  This will ensure that protected industrial action is not used as a substitute for genuine discussions during a bargaining period. </para><para>Support for secret ballots has been a position advocated by the Australian Democrats.</para><para>In the Democrats Senate Committee Report last November, Senator Murray indicated, and I quote, “As a principle the Australian Democrats are generally strongly supportive of direct democracy. Democrats are also strongly supportive of the democratic protections afforded by secret balloting processes.”</para><para>And following the rejection of the More Jobs Better Pay Bill 1999, the Leader of the Democrats has indicated that the Democrat concern appeared to be with matters of detail, not matters of principle. In speaking on Sydney radio about mandatory secret ballots, Senator Lees said on 29th November 1999, and I quote, “If we could go back to the government and talk to them as you're talking to us, you know in what I would describe as a reasonable and logical fashion, then the answer comes out as yes, there should be that provision.”</para><para>In introducing this bill I am clearly indicating that the Government is determined to proceed on an issue in respect of which there appears to be Democrat support. We invite the Democrats to make us keep the promise we made to the Australian people in October 1998 to introduce secret ballot requirements.  The Government is prepared to consider amendments to refine the detail of the secret ballots regime proposed by the bill, if it is the detail that is the barrier to the bill's passage through the Parliament.</para><para>Our intention is simple. We intend to implement the legislative amendments that reflect the policy objective on secret ballots in our second term workplace relations policy.</para><para>The provisions contained in this bill will introduce a requirement for a secret ballot to precede industrial action organised by employees or a union.  If this precondition is not met the industrial action will not be protected.  The precondition will not, however, apply following the suspension of a bargaining period unless the protected action proposed varies from that which was authorised by the ballot. </para><para>Either a union or an employee who is a negotiating party will be able to apply to the Commission for a protected action ballot to be held.  If an application for a ballot is made by a union, only union members whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in the ballot.  If the application is made by employees who are seeking a non-union agreement, all employees whose employment would be covered by the proposed agreement would be entitled to vote in a ballot. </para><para>Where the application is made by an employee, or several employees acting jointly, there must be evidence that the ballot application is supported by a prescribed number of employees at the workplace.  Where the application for a protected action ballot is made by an individual employee or employees, they will also have the option of doing so through an agent so that their identity will be protected.  This protection will also be extended to employees initiating a bargaining period.</para><para>The new provisions set out procedural requirements for ballots, including specific information that must be provided to employees in ballot papers.  Industrial action would be authorised by a ballot if at least 50 per cent of eligible voters participate in the ballot, and if more than 50 per cent of the votes cast are in favour of the proposed industrial action.</para><para>The Commission will be required to act quickly in relation to applications for protected action ballots, and would be required, as far as possible, to determine an application for a ballot order within 4 working days of the application being made.  In making a determination in relation to a protected action ballot application the Commission must be satisfied that the applicant has genuinely tried to reach agreement with the employer.</para><para>This bill enhances the role of the Commission. This is an outcome that should be welcomed by the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party who both regularly make calls to enhance the powers of the AIRC.</para><para>Unions would normally be liable for any costs incurred in the process of consulting their members over proposed industrial action.  However, consistent with the Government's commitment to ensuring responsiveness and accountability, the Commonwealth will reimburse 80 per cent of the reasonable cost of the ballot - whether the application is made by a union or an individual employee or employees.</para><para>These measures will improve the quality of workplace relations in our community, and the grass roots involvement of working people in decisions that affect their jobs, job security and working conditions.</para><para>Of course this matter has already been before a Senate committee. However, the government would welcome further Senate scrutiny provided that such a committee will review the bill in order to achieve a workable scheme rather than just be a platform for union opposition to fundamental democratic principles.</para><para>The right of the Coalition to implement its workplace relations mandate, subject to constructive Senate review, is a principle that has been acknowledged by the Democrats - and one that they should now act upon.</para><para>On 15th June 1996 the then Leader of the Australian Democrats (now Labor shadow Minister Kernot) said on the issue of workplace relations, and I quote:</para><para>“The Democrats accept that the Government has been elected to govern and that it has its right to present its legislative program to the Parliament for consideration. But the Democrats have been elected to do a job, and that is to closely scrutinise legislation to ensure that it is fair, and workable and the best solution to an identified problem.”</para><para>“...the Democrats have no intention of being obstructionist in this Senate. As we have done for 15 years of holding balance of power, we will carefully review legislation, suggesting ways to make it work better if possible.”</para><para>Adopting a just say `no' attitude to this bill would be inconsistent with not only the proper role of the Senate as a House of Review, but also breach the principle under which the Democrats themselves marked out their past approach to these issues, at least until 1997.</para><para>THE PROTECTION OF THE SEA (CIVIL LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</para><para>The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Amendment Bill 2000 will amend the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 (Civil Liability Act) to strengthen Australia's existing legislation governing the protection of the marine environment.</para><para>The most important amendment in this Bill is the insertion of a new Part IIIA into the Civil Liability Act to require all ships entering or leaving an Australian port and which carry oil either as cargo or as fuel to be insured to cover the cost of any pollution damage from the ships.  The amendment will only apply to ships of 400 tons or over.  This is the size of ship to which international conventions on marine pollution generally apply.</para><para>The amendment will not apply to oil tankers carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil as cargo.  The Civil Liability Act already requires those ships to have an insurance policy to cover the cost of the clean up following a spillage of oil.  This is in accordance with the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. </para><para>The amendment will give effect to recommendations contained in the 1992 Ships of Shame report and the 1998 Ship safe report.  It is also consistent with the Government's ongoing commitment in this area as set out in Australia's Ocean Policy, which was released by the Government in 1998.</para><para>Shipowners already have an obligation to meet any pollution liabilities they incur in Australia.  This legislation will merely require shipowners to have insurance to cover those existing liabilities.  There is a risk in the case of a major spill that an uninsured shipowner would not be able to meet his or her liabilities to contribute to the cost of the clean up.  A shipowner does not have unlimited liabilities in the case of an oil spill.  However, existing liability limits are high enough to meet the total cost of the clean up following the majority of spillages.  The requirement for insurance will ensure that the cost of the clean up does not have to be met by Governments and the community.  The amendment has the full support of the shipping industry.</para><para>Customs officers will check every ship that enters an Australian port to determine if the ship has appropriate insurance cover.  As this check will be part of the routine check of documentation that already occurs for all ships, it will not place an administrative burden on either the crew of ships or on Customs.  Any ships that do not have adequate insurance may be detained until the requirements of the legislation are met.  While the master and owner of an uninsured ship will be liable on conviction of a penalty of up to 500 penalty units, the possible detention for failure to be insured is a greater incentive for a shipowner to arrange insurance.</para><para>In the international context, Australia, as a member of the International Maritime Organization, has been a key advocate for an international regime of compulsory insurance to cover the cost of pollution damage following a spill of bunker fuel.  A draft text for a new international instrument has been developed and is expected to be concluded in early 2001, although it is expected to be some years before any new convention comes into effect internationally.</para><para>These amendments to the Civil Liability Act are being introduced now, rather than waiting for the conclusion of an international convention, because of the importance placed on the protection of the Australian marine environment by the Government.  A number of other countries, such as Canada and the United States, have similar domestic legislation in place.</para><para>The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is empowered by the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 to take “intervention action” to prevent or reduce pollution where oil or some other noxious substance  has escaped from a ship or is likely to escape from a ship.  The intervention action may range from moving the ship to another place to, in an extreme case, sinking the ship.  The cost to AMSA of such intervention action may be recovered from the shipowner.  The shipowner's liability is limited by section 20 of the Civil Liability Act.  There is currently some uncertainty about the liability limits that apply, due in part to the use of obsolete terminology.  Part 2 of the Bill amends section 20 to remove the uncertainty by specifying that the limit will be the limit that applies under any international conventions in force in Australia that apply to the ship.</para><para>The Civil Liability Act allows AMSA to recover any costs it incurs in performing its function under its enabling legislation to combat pollution in the marine environment, where the pollution is caused by a discharge or disposal from a ship.  The Civil Liability Act is quite explicit in stating that AMSA may recover its costs where there has been an actual discharge or disposal from a ship.  But there is some doubt about AMSA's ability to recover its costs where there has been a threat, but no actual discharge or disposal, for example, where a ship has gone aground.

This bill is setting out to clarify the circumstances and also to bring consistency to the various sorts of call-outs you can get. Yes, this bill does affect any potential call-out, whether that be during the Olympics or not. The first part of Senator Brown's question touched on the point of protocols. The national antiterrorist plan, which the states and the Commonwealth subscribe to, does have provisions which would deal with the situations that Senator Brown has mentioned, and we feel that would be sufficient. Protocols are really not essential because the national antiterrorist plan caters adequately for any situation that might arise. Should this bill be passed, there may well be some slight amendments to the national antiterrorist plan. We would say that those protocols are not necessary.

Minister, having appeared many a time in a criminal case as an advocate—of course—and as an outstanding advocate in Western Australia, may I say, you would understand the point I am making. The sort of action that the police or the troops might use has to be much more restrained than that which the terrorists might use. This is the whole problem about policing: because you want to have a civilised society, you have to act in a particular way. What is being asked is this: what criteria can be made public so that people can say, `Yes, these are the sorts of things that apply,' to assure us that the troops will act in the way that we would like?

There are, however, some security aspects which are operational and are not public, of course—and that is understandable.

But there are aspects to security operations which are not made public—again, for obvious reasons.

You see, what we have here is a piece of legislation that is not antiterrorist; that is part of it. If it were antiterrorist, I would not be nearly so concerned about this, but it opens up the whole field to the use of the ADF in circumstances where civilians are not just indirectly but maybe directly involved in a protest situation, for example.

Perhaps I can put it this way: the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> of course would have to be reviewed after the passage of this bill, as I have mentioned earlier. Furthermore, there are training notes supplementary to that manual. So it is not just the manual itself; there are supplementary training notes to it. I would draw that to Senator Brown's attention.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the points that Senator Faulkner raised, I think we have to remember, as the very basis, that any member of the Australian Defence Force would be subject to the law as it applies in that state or territory, and there is no escaping from that. So the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> would not necessarily give that person exemption from any of the laws of the land. For example, a member of the Australian Defence Force would not be exempted from the provisions relating to murder or assault. Those criminal provisions would still apply to that member of the ADF as much as to any other citizen in that jurisdiction. That is the starting point. The law applies to any member of the ADF in the call-out situation as it does to any other citizen. What you have, of course, with the MLW is a manual which deals with how they go about their business in that call-out. But it is not a manual which overrides in any way the law which applies in that jurisdiction. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>17046</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I think behind the questions is a knowledge by the Senate that, really, any manual on standing orders or procedures needs to be broken up into its different uses in situations of different intent. Typically, if I may deal with the first and most obvious, a manual of land warfare would have to deal with a situation where Australia was at war and either conducting a war on foreign ground or defending a situation on its own ground. Secondly, it would need to deal with a situation of civil war. Thirdly, it would need to deal with your being required to act, generally speaking, in a foreign situation in pursuit of a particular objective. That might be a situation such as the East Timor objective, which is not a situation of war, but it is obviously a situation of great danger at times. Lastly, and I would think very far back in the military's mind—I would not think of it as being something that the military contemplates as being an expected occurrence—would be the situation that this bill deals with: troops being called out to deal with a domestic incident of some sort, perhaps provoked by terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>I have not read the MLW; I have just gone through a set of logical characterisations which seems apparent to me. I think it is not just a matter of the committee asking that that manual be reviewed to reflect the intentions of the bill but also that that manual would need to very much reflect the very different circumstances of troops being involved, to use Senator Cooney's example, in Sydney during a terrorism incident. It is the specific development of standing orders to deal with a domestic situation, particularly an urban situation, in Australia which any manual of standing orders would need to deal with. That is an explanation I would seek, because I assume that the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline>, in fact, covers the other range of activities that I have outlined and would be deficient in the area of domestic incidents.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>17046</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just to follow on from Senator Murray: I was wrong a while ago when I said that the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> does not cover the civil situation.

In speaking to the point that has been raised by Senators Faulkner, Brown and Murray, I would like to go to proposed section 51T(3). That portion of the bill refers to the use of `reasonable and necessary' force. Clause 51T(3) states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In addition, if a person is attempting to escape being detained by fleeing, a member of the Defence Force must not do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the person has, if practicable, been called on to surrender—</para></quote><para>so this raises Senator Brown's earlier point— </para><quote><para>and the member believes on reasonable grounds that the person cannot be apprehended in any other manner.</para></quote><para>The bill itself is wide open to an instance where the ADF will be able to use lethal force. The bill itself does not even state that that person has to be in any danger themselves. The ADF member does not have to substantiate that they were in imminent danger; all they have to be able to do is on reasonable grounds say that they could not apprehend the person in any other manner. If we go to the definitions in the front of the bill, the person that it is the intent to apprehend will be apprehended because they have one of the following things: a gun, a knife, a bomb or chemical weapons. I do not have any great problem at all with this applying to anyone who is threatening an ADF member with a gun, a knife—unless there is some reasonable doubt as to whether they should use lethal force—a bomb or a chemical weapon. But the definition itself also refers to `any other thing that is reasonably likely to be used to cause serious damage'. So the bill itself is so totally wide open that almost anything could be substantiated. A picket off a fence or anything like that used as a weapon could be substantiated as reason to use lethal force. For the purpose of the committee, can the minister convey how he sees that a member of the ADF will be required to prove on reasonable grounds that they believe there is no other manner of apprehending the person?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>17048</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to clause 51T of the bill, I point out to Senator Harris that subclause (2) has to be read with subclause (3). Subclause (3) begins with the words `in addition', and that means `in addition to the provisions in subclause (2)'. In subclause (2), there is the requirement that a member of the ADF, in exercising that force, must not:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the member believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to protect the life of, or to prevent serious injury to, another person (including the member); or</para><para>subject the person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.</para></quote><para>In subclause (2)(a) there is a restatement of the law as it exists across Australia in relation to self-defence, the protection of life, and also in relation to the protection of the life of another person or protection against injury to another person. Subclause (3) is in addition to that. You cannot read subclause (3) in isolation. Subclause (3) has been included because there may be a hostage situation where the person who is fleeing is fleeing to execute hostages. Subclause (3) is to incorporate any possible situation that might arise. Remember that we are dealing with very serious circumstances. Look back to the Munich Games and the hostage situation with the Israeli athletes—that is a classic circumstance where this provision might apply. But it must be read with subclause (2), which has that onus on the member of the ADF. Subclauses (2) and (3) must be read together, and we do not believe that gives a member of the ADF any increased licence to break the law.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17048</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister Ellison has said that the new rules which are going to govern the use of the ADF in civil situations, if this legislation passes, will be a disallowable instrument.

To look at subclauses (2) and (3), we have discussed the words `in addition'. Minister Ellison says that subclause (3) has to be taken with subclause (2), but I am not sure how it can be. Clause 51T talks about the `use of reasonable and necessary force'. Subclause (1) says that a member of the ADF may use such force against persons. Subclause (2) says that, in circumstances where you want to prevent serious injury to another person or to protect the life of another person, you can take certain action—that is, you can cause death or grievous bodily harm. That is where you have somebody who is going to cause serious injury to another person—for example, you are a soldier and you see that Senator Crowley is going to cause serious injury to Mr Evans, so you take action against Senator Crowley. That is a situation where she is causing serious injury to someone. Subclause (3) does not contemplate that at all. Subclause (3) is aimed at stopping somebody from escaping. There is nothing in subclause (3) that suggests that the person, while escaping, should be causing bodily harm to anybody else. In most cases where they are escaping, they are running away—of course, they might be shooting as they are running away. But, in spite of the words `in addition', subclause (3) seems to contemplate something quite different from subclause (2). I do not want to cast any aspersions on the Office of Legislative Drafting—I would never do that—but I am not sure that the words `in addition' do carry this into a situation where subclauses (2) and (3) are taken together. They seem to be quite separate situations—unless you say that you can take this action only when the person escaping is likely to cause injury to somebody else, but that does not quite make sense. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Rosemary (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Crowley)</inline>—The chair is pleased to assist Senator Cooney but is not keen on being an exemplar of the unkindest behaviour.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—I offer a great apology to a person whom I have known all my adult life as a person of the kindest and most glorious disposition.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>17049</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the record, it is clearly the intention of this legislation that subsection (3) be in addition to subsection (2). The factual situation that might be relied on is somewhat complex. I will put it this way: if, in a terrorist situation, the authorities had them at bay and one of the terrorists tried to escape to get to a position—say, up a parapet—to fire down on the crowd, that person could be termed as escaping to get to a different situation in order to inflict more harm. In the Munich situation, one of the terrorists ran away from the police to throw a grenade into a helicopter to kill the athletes who were inside it. In that situation a person was escaping from the police to do some harm. It is a situation that could be envisaged here: a terrorist could be escaping to get to another position to fire back from. The ADF member is in a situation where there is a threat and where the provisions of (2) are being met. On the face of it, one might say that the person is running away and that there is no more threat, but they are running away to another position to increase the threat, and that is what is being envisaged here.

If a person is about to injure somebody else, whether he or she is escaping or is not escaping but is simply there trying to cause danger, (2) covers it in any event. Why do you want the additional (3)? Subsection (2) states that an ADF member can shoot if he or she thinks that the person being shot at will cause serious injury to another person. Subsection (3) does not really add anything to that because, whether the person is fleeing or whether they are taking up a stationary position, that person—the criminal, if you like—is still going to inflict serious injury on another. The fact of escaping is quite irrelevant to that. So, the only additional thing in (3) is the escaping.

It is not anti-terrorist legislation; it is not confined to terrorism. It is legislation that is available to be used in a whole range of situations where the Prime Minister or the minister for defence of the day thinks there might be domestic violence, that is, in crowd control against Australian citizens. So, the list of instructions which might apply to a terrorist situation—like the Munich situation that the minister gave as an example—apply to crowd control situations in Australia without any further specific direction. It does not say that a person escaping can be shot if they are about to throw a grenade which will kill people. It just says a person can be shot if they are escaping.</para></talk.start><para>I think that leaves the defence forces vulnerable, and it certainly seems to be a licence which ought not to be there when you are controlling domestic violence within Australia. The problem with this legislation is that it is aimed at terrorism but has been extended to a whole range of unspecified domestic situations in which it becomes terrifying. If the government wanted to have the ADF on hand to deal with domestic situations which do not involve foreign terrorists, the legislation should specifically deal with that. We should have a separate piece of legislation dealing with terrorism, but we do not. They are all bundled in together. That is the whole problem with this legislation. It is treating, in certain circumstances, an Australian crowd as a terrorist phenomenon. It is not, it never will be and it never has been. It gives the defence forces powers beyond those of the state police forces, and it does not specify them.</para><para>A really important question is: does the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> or whatever replaces it have the power of law? Would a soldier who fired on and killed an Australian citizen, under the rules as outlined in that manual, be able to use that as a defence in the court? I do not think they would. No wonder the states have said that it is unsatisfactory to bring this legislation before the parliament without consulting them. We have a century of developing laws under which the police are used in domestic violence situations, and the laws are honed very finely for that. They have always been upgraded to meet the situation of a civilian emergency or crisis. That is not the situation with this legislation.</para><para>The ADF has never been used in armed confrontation with Australian citizens, but suddenly it is going to be used without that whole history which allows the laws to be very explicit as to what soldiers can or cannot do. The police know what they can or cannot do. I submit to you, Minister, through the chair, that this leaves not only citizens vulnerable but also members of the ADF vulnerable. This manual is not a legal document. It exposes members of the armed services to court action which will make them very vulnerable indeed—and so they should be. The alternative is to say to soldiers who are brought into a civil conflict in Australia, `You have to know what the law is in the Northern Territory, Western Australia or Tasmania, wherever it might be. You have to do a crash course. You have to be up to speed, as police officers are.' That is unreal. That is not going to happen. The government is exposing not only Australians but also the Australian defence forces to a legally indefensible situation through this legislation.  </para><para>The minister did not answer my previous question, so I will ask him to do so. The <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> currently guides the ADF on what to do in a confrontation in Australia. The minister says it will be replaced in the wake of this legislation with a new instrument which is disallowable. I ask the minister: will that instrument be brought before the parliament in the next week? If it will not, that means the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare </inline>which we have here is the guiding document as far as the armed services are con-cerned until some time after the Olympics.

The states have complained about that. The Senate should not allow the situation to occur where we have the legislation but we do not have the all-important regulations. We should be discussing the two together.

That does not mean, however, that the state or territory police—whoever it is—would not be in control of the situation.

In other words, are there any regulations or guidelines as to the maturity of the troops? If you have a young fellow who is going to shoot because he is frightened, then that is understandable.

Minister, we are bringing your attention here to the problem that the discretion is too broad and the safeguards are too limited. Without specific consent from a state police commissioner, a state premier, his or her cabinet and a state leader of the opposition, we are left in a position under this bill of having to accept the `trust us' line. I think your problem is that you are seeing it from the perspective of the current government. Whilst it may be appropriate to have a `trust us' line for the current government or the Labor opposition, neither the current government nor the Labor opposition can foresee what kind of government and what kind of opposition we will have in the future. It might well be that you would act properly as a government, even despite the extraordinary discretion given to you by this bill. It might well be that the Labor opposition, if they obtained government, would also behave in that same way. But you cannot guarantee to us the nature, form, manner or morals of a future government or a future opposition in this country. </para></talk.start><para>The discretion you are permitting to go through with this bill—the lack of consent, the lack of safeguards—can potentially put us in dire peril, as it has in other countries in the world which have been given such discretions and authorities.

We have consistently said that there is absolutely no problem with having a narrowly defined bill, specifically one that deals with terrorism and other issues of national emergency, but the discretions here are too wide and there are limited safeguards. Minister, it is true, is it not, that consent is not required? Consultation in the hands of a government of bad faith could simply represent the telling of that government as to what you are going to do because consultation is not defined and consent is absent from the bill. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>17059</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, there is an amendment proposed in relation to consultation, which we agree with.

It is an outrageous projection of the abuse of the Australian defence forces against Australian civilians who are acting peacefully to protest or to strike. The revision should be before the Senate, so that we can eliminate this sort of military projection of the use of deadly weapons against crowds of Australian people. No wonder there has been a directive in place over the last decade that the Australian Defence Force shall not be trained, according to this manual, for use against Australian civilians.

We are not going to get that debate, and I am surprised that the opposition is not leading the charge on this matter. This is profoundly serious legislation that affects the Australian community. As Senator Murray has said, legislation like this ought to be drawn up, having in mind a less responsible government somewhere down the line in the future, to circumscribe the government from unleashing the Australian Defence Force, so that it cannot be abused by a government down the line. To think that cannot happen in this country is to be naive, absolutely naive. We should be legislating responsibly here, and we are not. I can go on to enumerate other parts of this manual. The minister will always say, `Well, it is being revised.'

Senator Brown in his most recent contribution makes the distinction—and it is appropriate—about which of these particular manuals or regulations are and are not disallowable instruments before the parliament. But for clarity's sake, I think it would be extremely helpful if the minister would now indicate, in very clear terms to the committee, what the government's intentions are in terms of replacement manuals—not the regulations. The regulations I think we have heard about, and we know they are disallowable.

And I hear the point you make, which is not without some justification. You are saying, `Well, their content to some extent'—I imagine only a comparatively minor extent—`will depend on the nature of the final bill, if and when it is passed.' You make that point. But, frankly, there are only a few amendments to this legislation—they are important amendments, but there is only a limited number—that this committee will be examining. When is it likely that those manuals will be ready? What opportunity will be afforded for parliamentary scrutiny, if any, of those manuals? What commitments will you, as minister, or the government be willing to make in terms of making that manual, or those manuals, available to the parliament or available publicly? Perhaps we can get some actual clarity around that. I do not think there is any certainty about that. I think there is more certainty—I understand from what you have been saying—in relation to the regulations themselves.</para><para>We know that the situation is unsatisfactory and that the current manuals are unsatisfactory—that has been highlighted during the committee stage. If we can get some clarity about that, it might help. Let us just get on the record in this committee what will be made available and when it will be made available. I understand that the legislation has not passed the parliament yet and that, if it does, there might be some minor doubt about what it might contain in the final analysis. We all understand that is what we face. If you can give some indication to the committee about this, I suspect we might be able to move on and deal with the first amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>17062</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to division 3 of the manual, which relates to the provisions which are contained in this bill and are relevant to this bill, I can say that the revised division 3 will be available to the Senate prior to the Olympics.

I get back to this point: if it is about terrorism then undefined words are sometimes used, because you cannot gauge all the situations. But the government is explicitly extending this legislation to deal with a whole range of protest and strike situations in Australia by Australians, and the Australian Defence Force is to be brought out against them.</para></talk.start><para>It is wholly unsatisfactory that we have a manual in existence—until it is replaced—which allows unarmed crowds to be shot at. It allows the deployment of tanks in a so-called emergency situation—which the minister cannot define, but it could be any call-out situation and a situation in which, moreover, the request to the police is no longer required. Sure, there is going to be consultation, but the request and consent of the state and the state police force involved is not necessary under this legislation. Commonsense will prevail with governments as we know them, but legislation like this is quite dangerous if it does not take into account the potential for abuse. That is what is totally wrong with this legislation, and that is why it should be opposed. I could enumerate many things from the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Land Warfare</inline> `Aid to Civil Power'. It has come from the point of view of dealing with terrorism, dealing with foreign invasion and dealing with threats from armed people. It applies this to the civil domain, and you cannot do that. That is why we have police forces. This is very dangerous, because it does not maintain the integrity of the last century of practice, where the police forces keep the domestic peace and the defence forces protect us from foreign insurgency. There is a crossover situation where there is potential for terrorism. We would be foolish not to be prepared for that. But I reiterate that we are not dealing with antiterrorist legislation; we are dealing with legislation that goes to the civil domain. It does not have the checks and balances in it that it should have, and it should not be passed in the Senate.

Labor had a long time to consider this legislation. I know Senator Faulkner is not going to argue that the Labor Party amendment has been strengthened by the change; it has been manifestly weakened.

Ill as I am, I must respond to a couple of the things Senator Brown has said. There seems to be a lack of clarity here. I want to say this to Senator Brown, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: I understand why you raise the concerns that you have raised about the shooting of civilians and the use of APCs, or tanks. I note that you quote from the totally unsatisfactory manual that is currently in existence. We do share those sorts of concerns about the current situation. One difference is that we have tried to come to this with a somewhat open mind. We have come to examine this legislation from the perspective that, if we can improve it, we will. Like you, we are not satisfied with the situation. It is, as you have most eloquently and at great length outlined to us, unsatisfactory. You win that debate; you make that point. You have made it strongly, and you have made it consistently. Fair enough: very many people in the parliament—perhaps everyone in the parliament—and many in the wider community would share those concerns.</para></talk.start><para>What has our approach been in that circumstance? We have come to the <inline ref="R1122">Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000</inline> with an open mind to see if we can right some of those grievous wrongs that Senator Brown outlined to the committee. We do not believe the government has achieved that in the bill it has placed before the parliament. Again, we have come to the debate in the spirit of saying that, if we can improve the bill in a number of crucial areas so that it deals with those problems and the new problems that the government's legislation has created, we will accept that that is a significant improvement. But there are a lot of qualifications there, and they are really important qualifications from the perspective of the Labor opposition. What is the key qualification as far as this bill is concerned? Let me state it to this committee: we want to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never—I stress `never'—be used against any peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or—particularly, from a Labor perspective—industrial action. That is why we have moved the amendment, and we are going to stand by it.</para><para>As far as the Labor Party are concerned, it is a principle we will never resile from and, if it does not stand, the bill will fail. There is no argument about that. Senator Brown makes a point. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, let me say to Senator Brown: we are happy to have the debate around the Labor amendment. I would say to everyone in the committee: let us have the debate about the Labor amendment when it is moved and not during the debate on the first amendment that stands in Senator Bourne's name about a review of the legislation. I do not want to duck away from it, Senator Brown. You are entitled to put your view on that strongly, and I want to engage in it. I am not going to slide away from the debate on the propositions that the opposition is putting before the committee. But, with respect, I would suggest we have it at the appropriate time and place. </para><para>The only difference between the Labor amendment that was originally circulated and the one that you now have before you is that in the meantime the drafters got at it. I am assured that, in effect, there is no difference at all and no diminution of its intention or effect. But let us have that debate and, if you can convince me otherwise, we will be very interested, let me assure you. It is not the subject of some closed-door secret deal with the government or anybody else. That is the position that the Labor Party have put before this parliament and we will be arguing that position very strongly at the appropriate time in this committee stage.</para><para>We are not going to slide away from our commitment that the defence forces of this nation should never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action, and I think we share those concerns with many in this parliament and many in the community. Let the record be clear on what Labor intend to do and why we are going to do it. That is the initiative we have taken, and the opposition amendments are to give effect to that. As I hear from the Special Minister of State at the table, the government plan is to amend that opposition amendment that Senator Brown has quoted. I will have a look at what the government plan to do and what they say in support of any proposal to amend the opposition amendment. I cannot make a comment about that because I do not know what is being proposed at this stage.</para><para>The concerns that senators have raised are shared by the opposition. We are also concerned about the elements of the manual that Senator Brown has quoted—what can occur in the current situation. That is why we have looked at this bill from the point of view of trying to improve the status quo. That has been our motivation, and it will continue to be our motivation as we work through these issues before the committee—that is, if we move off the question of the review that stands in the name of Senator Bourne. I have indicated that we think it is an important principle too, but we think we have got a better formulation than the one Senator Bourne has put before this committee. We do accept that it is a crucial element of the bill, and we are treating that matter seriously as well. But for heaven's sake—and I think the minister should have made this point—there is a range of issues of concern to senators and there is a range of issues where the current drafting of the bill, in the view of many in this chamber, is inadequate. I am going to try to focus my remarks on the matters that are before the chair. I think I am showing a great deal more discipline than the minister is in that regard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>17065</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will show equal discipline. I am going to come back to Senator Bourne's amendment in a moment, but I want to respond to what Senator Faulkner had to say. The key point he was making is that the opposition wants to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action. If you are going to achieve that aim, that is what you write into legislation. That is why the Labor Party should be supporting the Greens amendment. Let me read how the Greens amendment fulfils that aspiration. The Greens amendment says the ADF can be deployed:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out or utilized in connexion with an industrial dispute.</para></quote><para>A further amendment says:</para><quote><para>And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience.</para></quote><para>That is exactly what Senator Faulkner says the opposition is setting out to do. If the opposition has those aims in mind, it should support the Greens amendments. It should not be using the weasel words that are in the ALP amendment which says the ADF can be used in civil situations, protests or strikes but not to `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons'. I submit to the chamber that that covers many, if not most, of the great protests and strikes of the last century. It could be in the minds of an antipathetic government here in Canberra that that situation is likely to lead to serious injury or death. Many situations in civil life present that predicament. Many workplaces present that predicament. Travelling to and from work presents that predicament for all of us. It leaves the field open to the misdirected but imaginative mind of a future set of ministers in a government which is not behaving well, as Senator Murray said in other words. And we should be covering that situation.  </para><para>I put to the opposition that, if its aim is indeed, as Senator Faulkner said, to improve this legislation—and it will accept significant improvements—and the aim is to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action when that time comes, that is exactly what my amendments for the Greens do. They are quite explicit: there are no ill-defined words; they are quite clear. They say exactly what Senator Faulkner says the opposition wants to achieve, and therefore they should be supported.

As all are now aware, the purpose of the bill before us is to provide a proper legislative framework for the exercise of the existing constitutional powers of the Commonwealth government to use its defence forces in domestic security situations. As I have indicated I hope clearly in my most recent contribution, the opposition believe that the current situation, the status quo, is imperfect. We accept that change is required. We accept that good legislation is needed. That is the fundamental reason why we have not embraced the proposal for a sunset clause, which has the effect of returning us to an unsatisfactory situation. But it is also essential in our view that this question of review is adequately dealt with.</para><para>We are critical about the way the government has drawn up this legislation. We are very critical about the lack of consultation. We are critical and concerned about the inadequate public debate. I think even our harshest critics would have to acknowledge that the Labor opposition have worked hard to see if we could correct that situation. The opposition took the initiative of having this bill investigated by a Senate committee. I think the opposition have been very serious in responding to the concerns that were put before that committee and have been aired in the ensuing public debate, which I think has largely resulted from the work of that Senate committee and its report. We are working to address the concerns that the committee had through the amendments we are moving.</para><para>We do face a real problem with the legislation, because of the unsatisfactory processes that I have outlined. This legislation has been brought forward in haste. There may well be a range of problems that have not already been identified and detected. That is the reason why the opposition are proposing this amendment to require a review of the legislation either within six months of the use of the call-out power or within three years of its enactment. This will ensure that the parliament and of course the community at large have an opportunity to not only review but, in the case of this parliament, amend the legislation if necessary.</para><para>I indicate to the chamber that the changes we have made to the original amendment—I have no doubt that Senator Brown might have identified this; he seems to look at these things pretty closely—which of course are reflected in the opposition amendment sheet 1895 revised 2, do not change the substance of our amendment on this issue. They, like the other changes I was speaking of a moment ago, are a response to the legislative drafting advice that we received and are aimed at ensuring our amendments are as clear as possible, as concise as possible and as effective as possible. I think the opposition's amendment here on this question of review of the legislation is an important one, and I commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>17067</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It appears to us that this is not nearly as good as having the review that we suggested—which has just been voted down—as well as the sunset clause. I cannot even say that it is a tenth as good. It is quite inadequate. Senator Faulkner mentioned that he believed a sunset clause would have the effect of returning to an unsatisfactory situation. No, it would not. Any government with any foresight at all and any feeling that this legislation was about to come to its sunset clause—and if a sunset clause is put in, we will all know exactly when that is—would write up a bill to replace this bill well and truly, months and months at least, before that sunset clause took effect. And even if that did not happen, why do we think Australia has suddenly turned into such a dangerous place that we need this? We have been going since 1903 as we are now. Why is it that we have to change next week?</para></talk.start><para>We are being told that it is because of the Olympics. I do not think that is right. I think there has been so much security and so much ability to use security put in place for these Olympic Games that this has to be the most secure Olympic Games—without this bill—ever held; incredibly secure. Look at the changes to the New South Wales legislation; look at the training of the New South Wales police force and the TRG—and even of the SAS. I know that they are from the Defence Force, but they could be used under certain circumstances. They could be used to show the police what to do; they could be used under other circumstances. There is no need for this bill; there just is not the need for it now. Australia is not that dangerous a place that we certainly have to have this. Since 1903 we have been going along very nicely, thank you very much. The disaster has not happened; the disaster is not going to happen. The disaster is certainly not going to happen before we can get this bill right. So I do not think this is necessary. </para><para>On the other hand, my proposed amendment for a review has just gone down, so we are not having one. I honestly fear that the proposed amendments for a sunset clause will probably go down—all of them. I am going to vote for all of them, but I think they are all going to go down. I also fear, more than anything, that the Labor Party in the end will vote for this bill. I think that is a great tragedy. Because of all of that, to make it a bit better, I will be voting for this because I think it is about the fifth-rate way of making it better. It is certainly not the best way of making it better and it is not the second-best way of making it better. How many amendments do I have? It comes after them—it comes after the Greens amendments; it comes after Senator Harris's amendments and it comes after the opposition's and the government's amendments. This really is not the way to go—to just leave this bill in force and have a review.</para><para>We had a review after the incident at CHOGM in 1975. Justice Hope had a review and made some very good recommendations, some excellent recommendations, which have not been brought up in this bill. So you have a review, but that does not mean that what is said will be taken into account. We have Senate inquiries all the time that have excellent recommendations, very well thought out and very well-written recommendations, that could quite easily be put into legislation and should be, and everybody agrees that they should be. But they never are. There are an awful lot of Senate committee and joint committee recommendations that go absolutely nowhere. So you have a review and what happens? Nothing—far too often, nothing. I can see nothing in here at all that would make them implement the recommendations of any review. Where is the bit of this amendment that says that the recommendations of the review must be carried out? There is nothing like that, and of course they will not put that in. </para><para>There is a recommendation in the Hope report that states:</para><quote><para>The Defence Force should be used only as a last resort, and an overriding principle is that troops should never in any circumstances be used to confront political demonstrators or participants in industrial disputes. Whatever logistical support they render, they must be protected by police, who alone must deal with any violence arising from objection to their support.</para></quote><para>Where has the government put that into the bill? That was a very good recommendation of the Hope report. It came out of a review, and where is it in what has ensued from that review? Nowhere. The government has not even considered that recommendation. So what government is going to consider the recommendations? I guess it will consider the recommendations of any review that happens under this opposition amendment. Yes, it will consider those recommendations. Then it will probably say, `No, sorry, it is working perfectly, thank you very much,' because nothing will have happened. And even if something does happen, it will probably be the same. There will be a review and nothing will happen.</para><para>It is just as well to have a review, because—as I, myself, said with the last amendment—it would, I hope, bring out exactly what happened if any action was taken. I hope to goodness no action ever will be taken; but if it is then this should bring out what happened. But there will have to be a review of the legislation after three years and things will have to happen if there is a sunset clause. If we vote for this one, there will have to be a review but nothing need happen at all—and I suspect that is what will happen.</para><para>So a sunset clause, I believe, is a far better way to go. Better still than that is to vote against it now and let us start again. But we are not going to get that. Since we are not going to get that I will be voting for this. But I really think we should all go away and over the lunch break think very seriously about what will happen if this keeps going, what will happen if this bill is put in and there is no sunset clause, if this bill is put in at all. Australia is not that dangerous a place. It really is not a very dangerous place at all, thank goodness, and there is no necessity to put this in right now. We could do it next month or the month after or the month after. We could think about it properly. We could do it properly. We do not have to do this. Please consider that. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>17069</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are dealing with guns and answering it with blancmange.

The issue of the sunset clause was raised, and in the discussions before the committee that day it was clearly determined that if we went down the path of having a sunset clause, Senator Brown, we would have exactly the circumstances that exist today, the circumstances that are completely anathema to what we should have. This bill goes to the point of tightening up—not opening up—the processes. Having a sunset clause there would achieve the very opposite of what you would hope it would achieve. That is the first thing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second thing is that a number of people—as I said in my speech in the second reading debate—have found this bill a fertile opportunity to go out there and stir up a lot of the conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that that has happened. But there are genuine concerns that people have raised about this bill and that have been pursued both at the committee level in the Senate and also before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee itself. I believe that the amendments that Labor have brought forward are genuine attempts to deal with the concerns that exist out there.</para><para>I have had people come to my office, sit down with me and go through some of the concerns that have been raised by Senator Brown, Senator Murray, Senator Harris and others in this debate. When I sit down with the people and take them through, firstly, the piece of legislation—which most of them have neither sighted nor heard of, apart from a couple of rumours on the news or something that someone has told them second- or third-hand—secondly, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the Senate legislation committee, thirdly, the recommendations that came out of that legislation committee, and fourthly the further parliamentary processes that will be involved, whilst it does not offer them a complete panacea nonetheless it allays a lot of the fears that have been promoted during the campaign waged against this particular piece of legislation. The fact is that all the powers are, as I understand it, already there. What we have through this piece of legislation and, in particular, through the amendments that are being put forward by Labor, is a tightening up process—not a loosening process; a tightening up process. I think the review process will stand this piece of legislation in good stead. The process is one that was insisted upon by the committee in its report. The amendment that has been put forward by Senator Faulkner tightens up the legislation even further. I think that it is an excellent amendment, and I commend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>17070</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot let that one go, I am sorry.

What we do today or on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday or on Thursday—whenever this finishes—will be the end of the discussion of this bill.

It is not just us in this chamber who have looked again at the bill; many people outside the chamber have looked again at the bill and have found things. They have thought of things and they have determined things that need to be looked at again. It is happening daily. It happened yesterday. The opposition keep changing their amendments. I see no problem with that. If they are improving them, great! But we have not finished, have we? We changed them again yesterday. We will probably change them again today.

Of course it enables the defence forces to do things legally that they could not do before. It has to. If it did not, we might as well toss it out now—who cares; we do not need it.

Since 1991, a focus of the therapeutic goods legislation has been to ensure greater access by the Australian community to new drugs through the creation of exemptions to the requirement for all drugs to be entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods before supply. These exemptions include supply through clinical trials, the special access scheme and authorised prescribers. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000 will provide additional powers to the secretary to ensure the use, handling and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods is in accord with the terms and conditions applied when the exemption for supply is granted. This greater control will be achieved principally through the secretary's new powers to require persons to whom an approval or an authority has been granted to supply unapproved products to provide information about how the goods are used. It also provides that, should the information provided warrant it, the TGA could audit the processes used to supply the goods, including the conduct of clinical trials. An amendment also enables the secretary to release information where necessary to appropriate authorities in the states or territories with functions relating to therapeutic goods and to medical or pharmacy boards. </para><para>The amendments which the government wishes to add to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000 today will ensure public health and safety through correcting a number of deficiencies relating to product recalls in the existing legislation. Since March this year, there have been two instances of product tampering involving paracetamol products. Both incidents involved attempted extortion and resulted in serious poisoning. In both cases, the sponsors of the paracetamol products, Herron Pharmaceuticals and SmithKline Beecham, undertook voluntary recalls of potentially affected products. To date, the extortionist has not been apprehended.</para><para>On 31 March 2000, following contamination of products supplied by Herron Pharmaceuticals, the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, wrote to the Prime Minister seeking agreement to urgent action by the Commonwealth to take a leading role in streamlining the product recall process at the national level. On 29 June 2000, the National Consultative Committee on Therapeutic Goods, comprising representatives of Commonwealth, state and territory health authorities, met urgently to agree on strategies to manage future attempts to tamper or interfere with therapeutic goods. At that meeting the adequacy of recall powers and other powers available under the existing therapeutic goods legislation, particularly those in the Commonwealth's Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, was also examined. The committee urged the legislative amendments be made with some urgency to safeguard integrity of medicines and medical devices in the marketplace and to minimise the risk to public health.</para><para>The committee recommended that the Commonwealth's Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 be amended to include a requirement for mandatory reporting of product tampering or implied tampering, incorporating penalty provisions for non-compliance; mandatory recall powers in cases of product tampering and/or where sponsors refused to recall goods with penalty provisions for non-compliance; the introduction of a new category of offence for the supply of a recalled product; and the release of information by the Commonwealth relating to product tampering to state, territory and overseas regulatory authorities with responsibilities for therapeutic goods or terrorism. The recommendations of the committee have been discussed with and agreed to by the peak therapeutic goods industry associations—the APMA, the ASMI, the CHC, the MIAA, and the Consumer's Health Forum. State and territory governments have given their written support for the proposed measures to be effected through changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>17073</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support the passage of <inline ref="S257">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000</inline>, including the amendments that the parliamentary secretary has foreshadowed. This legislation deals with very important issues. Firstly, the original bill deals with the monitoring of the supply and use of unapproved therapeutic goods, and, secondly, the amendments deal with the recent extortion attempts and the impact that that had on the public of Australia. It was a very serious matter, as we know. We fully support the increased powers being granted to the TGA to deal with those issues involving public health and safety. On that basis, we support the passage of the bill.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>17073</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="S257">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000</inline>, as I see it, not only deals with the question of tampering, which I had inadvertently considered it to be, but also has privileges in it relating to the powers of the secretary and the CTN scheme. Honourable senators will recall that I have had a longstanding interest in the CTN scheme and whether it was adequate in a number of areas, not least the area of critical assessment of the application for the clinical trials as to their being ethical, as to their being safe, and the like. Honourable senators can see that I have raised these matters during estimates committee hearings and so on. </para></talk.start><para>I do apologise to the parliamentary secretary for not raising these matters before and clearing them with him and his office. But I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary would elaborate on what is contained in part of the second reading speech where it states:</para><quote><para>Since 1991 a focus of the therapeutic goods legislation has been to ensure greater access by the Australian community to new drugs through the creation of exemptions to the requirement for all drugs to be entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods before supply. These exemptions include supply through clinical trials, the Special Access Scheme and Authorised Prescribers.</para><para>The resulting exemptions have been very successful in achieving greater patient access to new drugs. Notification of clinical trials to the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the CTN scheme has resulted in a very marked increase in clinical trial activity in Australia. From less than 50 clinical trials conducted in 1990 there are now well over 400 new clinical trials notified to the TGA each year. </para><para>The very success of the programs has led to occasional concern.</para></quote><para>This is a matter that I want to raise in the committee. It continues:</para><quote><para>The nature of notification schemes is such that Commonwealth involvement is minimal. They rely on certification and approval by medical practitioners and institutions. Should the processes of approval be less than rigorous, the legislation gives no ability to the Commonwealth to investigate and take action to ensure patient safety.</para></quote><para>The parliamentary secretary goes on:</para><quote><para>The amendments in this Bill will provide additional power to the Secretary to ensure the use, handling and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods is in accord with the terms and conditions applied when the exemption for supply is granted.</para></quote><para>It goes on to talk about how these greater controls are applied. I remind the Senate, however, that in respect of the clinical trials the TGA in effect is not required to approve trials because the approval is by an ethics committee. I know we are all concerned at times by the fact that some medical practitioners do believe that they have almighty powers, and I think that very often there is too much obeisance paid to doctors who have a couple of letters after their name. Obviously these are in the tiny minority of the profession. Members of the profession are very often concerned about the activities of these people because they reflect on the whole profession. </para><para>If the parliamentary secretary would not mind, I would like him to indicate to the committee just two things: one, is the proposal that is now before us actually strengthening the power of supervision of CTNs and, two, how will this be achieved? If that is the case, then obviously there is no need to pursue the matter at this particular stage. I do apologise again to the committee and particularly the parliamentary secretary that I had not noted this particular change. Obviously I did not then take advantage of my ability to seek to refuse this matter going formally before the chamber. I will not press that because it is entirely my fault that I had not sufficiently availed myself of the very generous offer of the parliamentary secretary to have his officers brief me.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>17074</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Senate for its comments and support with regard to the matters of tampering and recalls in this area. I now turn to the issues that have been addressed by Senator Harradine, particularly with regard to clinical trials. I indicate that the changes relating to clinical trials and the use of unregistered drugs provide additional public health and safety measures so that people involved in trials or who need to use unregistered drugs for some reason can have greater confidence that their interests are protected and that there are appropriate powers resting with the Department of Health and the TGA to make inquiries and take action, should that be necessary. These changes clarify the necessary powers required for the secretary to ensure that there are appropriate oversight and safety measures for trials. Australia's provisions for clinical trials, including the CTN scheme, have served Australia well. These changes strengthen protections for Australians, and I am certainly pleased to note Senator Harradine's ongoing interest in this issue. </para></talk.start><para>The current amendments leave intact the process of clinical trials and special access. They incorporate in the legislation that the standard of clinical trials should be that set by the NHMRC's national statement on ethical conduct in research involving humans. This also incorporates the code of good clinical practice, which is an international standard for the conduct of clinical trials. The amendments provide for the TGA to have the power to inquire and, if necessary, to audit the function of doctors and institutions supplying unapproved products should there be any evidence that patients are not being adequately protected.</para><para>I think Senator Harradine also asked what sort of information would be sought under the power to inquire. I am informed that the information required by the secretary will be that which is necessary to allow the secretary to establish that the supply, handling and use of unapproved products meets acceptable standards. Depending on circumstances of the use of the product, this information may be required from the doctor to whom an approval is given in relation to SAS or authorised prescribers, the sponsor of a clinical trial who has either notified a trial under the CTN scheme or been given approval in relation to the CTX scheme, or a clinical investigator participating in a clinical trial using goods for which an approval has been given to someone else.</para><para>With regard to how the operation of the special access scheme will be affected, the day-to-day operation of the special access scheme will be unaffected. The main changes are in relation to the secretary's ability to formally inquire about the use of unapproved products under the SAS, particularly in relation to supply to category A patients. The supply of unapproved therapeutic goods to category A patients as defined in the regulations does not require prior approval by the TGA. The secretary will be able to request information where necessary about the use of the product, including the condition of the patient being treated. This will ensure that this mechanism is not used to bypass the requirement to otherwise obtain TGA approval prior to the supply of an unapproved product. The proposed change does not change the original intent of the category A provisions whereby access to unregistered products for persons with life-threatening conditions is considered to be a matter for the patient and doctor without interference from government.</para><para>What effect will there be on the conduct of clinical trials? The overall effect of the changes will be to further enhance the rights, safety and wellbeing of participants in clinical trials in Australia. The changes ensure that investigators must comply with appropriate standards when conducting clinical trials. This will include the need for compliance with good clinical practice, an internationally accepted standard for the design, conduct, recording and reporting of clinical trials and compliance with the trial protocol and with Australian ethical standards. In addition, the secretary will be able to investigate matters relating to clinical trials conducted under the clinical trial notification and the clinical trial exemption schemes.</para><para>Initial inquiries about and subsequent inspections of clinical trials would be undertaken where necessary on safety grounds and to investigate non-compliance with legislative requirements, the trial protocol or accepted standards for conduct of a trial. The CTN scheme will remain a notification scheme. The CTX scheme remains an application-based scheme. I trust this explanation picks up the points that Senator Harradine has raised. As I said earlier, we are pleased to note his ongoing interest in this issue and will continue in dialogue with him.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>17075</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><para>Amendments (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><quote><para>(1)	Clause 2, page 1 (lines 7 to 9), omit the clause, substitute: </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">2 Commencement</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	Subject to this section, this Act commences on the day on which it receives the Royal Assent.</para><para>	(2)	Schedule 1 commences on the 28th day after the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent.</para><para>(2)	Clause 3, page 1 (line 11), omit “Each”, substitute “Subject to section 2, each”.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 1, heading to Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2), omit the heading, substitute:</para></quote><para>Schedule 1<inline font-weight="bold">—</inline>Exemptions</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</inline></para><quote><para>(4)	Page 11 (after line 19), at the end of the Bill, add:</para></quote><para>Schedule 2<inline font-weight="bold">—</inline>Product tampering</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989</inline></para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">1  Subsection 3(1)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">actual or potential tampering</inline> has the meaning given by section 42U.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">2  Subsection 3(1)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration</inline> means:</para><para>	(a)	the person holding the position of National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration;

The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to extend the operation of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme from the current expiry date of 14 September 2000 to a new expiry date of 30 June 2001.</para></talk.start><para>The Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme, as I am sure senators will recall, was announced back in 1997 by the then minister, John Anderson. It was part of the government's much vaunted AAA package—Agriculture Advancing Australia. This scheme allowed farmers a three-year period, commencing on 14 September 1997, to gift their farms and farm assets up to a value of $500,000 to their children or the next generation of the family without that affecting their access or entitlement to receive an age or Veterans' Affairs pension. At the time it was said by the government that this was to assist farmers to pass on the operations of their farm and the assets of their farm to the next generation in the family.</para><para>A number of eligibility criteria were laid down, but the main ones were: first, there had to be a long-term involvement in farming; second, the total income had to be less than the applicable age or veterans pension rate for the three years prior to transfer; and, third, persons had to be of age pension age or reach that age before the expiry of this scheme. The government claimed at the time that this scheme would be taken up by 10,000 farmers. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—Less than 2,000. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Yes.

The government's great predictions for this scheme, just as happened with their great predictions for other elements of the AAA package, have really come to very little.

My figures say 1,400. In any event, the fact is that it is a long way short of the stated target—an expectation of 10,000. Of course, the farming communities themselves—the farmer organisations—have been particularly critical of the scheme, claiming that the asset and income test is too tight and is a barrier to farmers accessing it. As Senator Woodley will recall, this is an issue that we in the opposition—and I know he has—have taken up probably at every estimates hearing since the scheme was announced. So, once again, we have an indication of the claims made by this government at that time. As I said, Agriculture Advancing Australia has really done little to improve the position of the farming community. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We nevertheless do support the extension of the scheme because it will allow a further period of 9 months or so to enable any other farmers who may qualify and who wish to take up the opportunities under the scheme to do so. That is the purpose of the legislation being before the chamber. On that basis, we support it. As I said, we indicate that this would not have been necessary if the government had better understood the farming community's needs and had not been as expansive in their predictions as they were at the outset.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>17079</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me begin my contribution today by saying that the Democrats are very pleased to see the <inline ref="R1117">Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme Extension Bill 2000</inline> introduced into federal parliament, legislation which extends the time for the take-up of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme. I add to the comments made by Senator Forshaw that our disappointment is that, although this is a very good scheme, it is far too restrictive. The last time we debated this legislation, I placed on record the fact that I wished to move a number of amendments to the legislation which would have solved many of the problems the bill has encountered over the last three years. Unfortunately, I did not get any support from the government for that. It should have supported me. At the time, the Labor Party indicated that it could not support those amendments either, although I feel that at the time perhaps Senator Forshaw would like to have supported them.

I followed up a number of agricultural issues that I had pursued a couple of years earlier, and I was very interested in the approach of the Irish government to rural policy. The one thing that we cannot duplicate, of course, in our rural policy is the subsidies that they receive from the EU, but I have got to say that they certainly use those subsidies in a very creative way and in a very comprehensive overall farm policy that I was entirely impressed with. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—That wasn't a study tour you were on, was it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—Why don't you go over and have a look yourself, Senator McGauran, and maybe you would learn something. I discovered that they had this comprehensive farm policy which picked up the very issue that we are debating today: the retirement of older farmers so that younger farmers can access the farms and come onto the land. They did not treat it as welfare. That was interesting. It was administered by the department of agriculture in Ireland as a total approach to retaining population in rural communities and rural areas and supporting farmers in terms of their income, their approach to the environment and their approach to rural cultural heritage. In fact, it was a total overview of how farm policy can be used to support the total rural population and rural income in Ireland. In terms of retirement assistance for farmers, which is what I want to concentrate on today, they did not view the retirement of farmers as a social security issue; they viewed it as part of an overall approach to support for rural communities. Their retirement policy has few of the restrictions that our policy seems to be totally hedged in by. The pension there for aged farmers is around 10,000 Irish pounds per year—roughly around $20,000. </para></talk.start></continue><para>There are two very, very significant outcomes from the retirement policy in Ireland and the other support policies that surround it. The first one is that they are finding now that the average age of farmers is beginning to be lowered. In Australia and in many other developed nations we are finding that the average age of family farmers is going up; I think that it is about 58 at the present time in Australia. What is happening is that, because of the way in which this particular policy is directed in Ireland, the average age of farmers is starting to go down, because it is allowing older farmers to retire with proper support and with dignity and, therefore, allowing younger farmers at an earlier age to come onto the land and to take up farming. That is, I believe, a very beneficial outcome of that policy. </para><para>The other thing that this policy is doing is actually keeping farming families intact in rural areas. Of course, that is one of the biggest problems we have in Australia: young people are not only leaving farming but leaving rural communities altogether.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Andrew (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Bartlett)</inline>—Order!

I was actually ignoring them, but I know you are closer and so you no doubt were being interrupted. These are some of the beneficial aspects of a total rural policy administered by the agriculture department, so it is not seen as a welfare payment or as a social security issue. That is why I believe we should be looking at what the Irish are doing. Perhaps we cannot access the kinds of subsidies which they access. Nevertheless, I believe we could learn much from many of the policies that they have put in place, which take a comprehensive approach to rural communities and to farming. In the coming weeks in this chamber I hope to put some more of what they are doing on the record, because I think it would be useful for us to have a look at that. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think Senator Forshaw was arguing across the chamber in respect of the figure and whether it was 1,400 or 1,700. I am not sure that is an argument that matters. Less than 2,000 have taken up this scheme. Minister Anderson announced at the time, when he trumpeted the benefits of the AAA package, that 10,000 would take it up. The number is certainly well short of that mark. I urge the government not only to extend the time for this scheme but also to have a look at some of the restrictions on it, because a lot of farmers will not take it up even if we do extend the time unless we deal with some of the other stumbling blocks. </para><para>I was going to give a fair bit of detail about those stumbling blocks, just as I did in my speech in 1998. However, given the limitation on time in this place and the wish of the government that the bill be passed, I will not do so. I am sure that senators are not going to rush off and read my 1998 speech. However, I will say that, in talking to staff from Mr Truss's office who came to brief me on the bill, when I told them about some of those amendments and the Irish scheme they seemed interested and said that they would certainly look into it. They may wish to look up my 1998 speech, because it sets out all of the stumbling blocks that we see in the way of the operation of this scheme.  </para><para>I might add that, in moving amendments in 1998, what we were doing, of course, was totally endorsing the approach of the National Farmers Federation, which agreed totally with the amendments that we sought to move. Those amendments were supported by a Senate inquiry; there was lots of evidence that what we said then was true. One of the amendments we wanted to move was to extend the scheme from three years to five years. In effect, that is what we are doing today. What we said then was true and the government is now catching up. That is good to see. I hope that the scheme—which is still, I believe, being strangled by restrictions—can be looked at in terms of extending the time and that the government will also in the future look at reviewing the eligibility criteria. If it does not do that, this will be an opportunity which, once again, the government will have missed. I commend the bill. It is a good piece of legislation. The scheme needs to be extended. At this point, we support extending the time for its take-up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>17081</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, in common with you I look forward to further instalments of Senator Woodley's travelogue and I am sure that we will all be, if not the wiser, better informed as a result of future contributions by the honourable senator. </para></talk.start><para>I thank senators for their cooperation in this debate. This bill extends the successful Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme for a further nine months. For the record, I point out that 1,724 farmers and their partners have in fact been assisted under this scheme. It has enabled them to pass the farm to the next generation, continuing the tradition of the family farm. The number of farmers assisted so far is close to the target of 2,100, which I understand was the figure referred to during the second reading speech when this legislation was introduced.</para><para> Furthermore, there are a further 165 applicants that have been pre-assessed as eligible if they choose to go ahead. It should be remembered that this scheme is, in fact, demand driven. I understand that the figure of 10,000 may have been obtained from a media release that mentioned a preliminary review of ABARE farm survey data that suggested that as many as 10,000 farms could potentially meet the eligibility criteria for this measure. That figure has now been bandied around as somehow meaning that, of necessity, 10,000 would take it up. The simple fact is that that is what the ABARE figures indicated. When we introduced the legislation, we talked about a figure of 2,100. </para><para>Senator Woodley and Senator Forshaw undoubtedly know that this is a demand driven scheme. Also, Senator Woodley would be very well aware of the cultural difficulties for farmers in actually moving off the land or saying that they are going to retire from farming. Farmers have great emotional attachment to their properties, and the thought of giving up farming is a great emotional adjustment that some of them have made and others have not found themselves able to make. As a result, I think it is a bit unfair to try to criticise the scheme because of the quite understandable emotional attachment of many farmers to their property.</para><para>As I indicated, the bill does not change the eligibility criteria in any other way. I think there is acceptance around the chamber that, as part of our AAA package, this was a good initiative. We can argue around the boundaries, but in general terms there is support for it.

In relation to the content of treaties, of course treaties are agreements between governments and impose obligations upon governments, and those obligations might include obligations in relation to the behaviour of governments towards their citizens.

As Chair of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, she quite properly takes a very keen interest in native title matters.

The Mining Council said: </para></talk.start><quote><para>The stalled investment, loss of jobs and collapse of exploration spending in Queensland now remains totally unsolved. The federal ALP has completely destroyed the workability of Queensland's scheme by disallowing the very heart of that scheme—the alternative provisions to the right to negotiate under section 43A. </para></quote><para>This is not only devastating for Queensland's minerals industry but a complete and utter humiliation for Premier Beattie. He has pretty pathetically tried to put the best gloss on what is a disaster for him and Queensland, but he has been completely sold out—and he knows that he has been sold out—by his federal ALP colleagues. His scheme, which was designed to kick-start mining exploration in Queensland, has had the heart ripped out of it by Mr Beazley. We on this side are all glad that Mr Melham has resigned, so we will not have to watch him on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program any more, embarrassing himself and the federal Labor Party. But I cannot understand for the life of me why he has resigned, because he and his left faction have had a major victory over Premier Beattie and their own right faction. Back in April, Mr Beattie said about the prospects of defeat of his scheme:</para><quote><para>Mining exploration has been virtually nonexistent since the High Court decision in December 1996. A defeat will be the most savage blow for both mining and indigenous communities in more than a generation. It will send mining companies offshore for their exploration and will destroy job opportunities.</para></quote><para>That is what Mr Beattie said would happen if his scheme fell apart, and it has fallen apart. By gutting the Queensland scheme, the federal ALP will be responsible for delivering that outcome to Queensland. Mr Beattie knows full well that the 1993 right to negotiate process is unworkable on pastoral leases, and it was never intended to apply on pastoral leases. That is why he proposed his 43A scheme, which would have given native title claimants substantial procedural rights regarding mining on pastoral leases, better than the rights that even the titleholders—the leaseholders—have, but of course that was ignored by Mr Beazley in this attempt to appease his own Left.</para><para>The future for Australia's minerals industry really is in doubt and it has now been made much worse by Mr Beazley's weakness. Mineral exploration in Australia is in steep decline; it is heading overseas. The 2000 world risk survey of the 20 leading resource countries ranked Australia as the most risky country for land claims, and that risk is now compounded by what Labor did yesterday to this country.</para><para>The Queensland economy is particularly dependent on the resources industry. It is its major source of investment, jobs and growth. Of course, the major victims of this are Aboriginal communities in regional Australia. Aboriginal regional communities have as their best hope the future of the mining industry. The Century zinc mine, which the opponents of the resources in this country tried to stop, employs some 150 Aboriginals. About 35 per cent of the work force is Aboriginal, and the chances of having another Century mine have been dealt a massive blow by what the Labor Party did yesterday. Mr Beazley has sold out his own Labor Premier and the state Labor government in Queensland, and he has sold out the resources industry and everybody who works in it.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Research and Development: Funding</title><page.no>17083</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>17083</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin.

Of course, the electoral laws of this country require that donations or gifts in kind to a political party of more than $1,500 have to be declared. So how did Labor get around this? What they did was to get a fundraiser to organise the dinner, the payments were made to the fundraiser and then there was a disclosure of the total amount, which came to just under half a million dollars. So what you had was a complete breach of the intention of the funding and disclosure provisions contained in our electoral legislation.

That is, where there are opportunities to meet with senior people visiting this country—particularly in my area of responsibility, IT—it would be a very sad day indeed if people were deterred simply because people like the Labor Party, and presumably the Democrats, would want to score cheap political points.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was not for a moment suggesting that anyone should be accepting $10,000 packages, but I was making the very clear point that it was not just in relation to Telstra. There are a whole range of companies who are making invitations available to attend the Olympics Games. Those invitations will involve opportunities to meet with senior people—and those opportunities would not otherwise be available—because they are guests of those corporate entities. In those circumstances, I was simply using a little bit of hyperbole and using the term `criminal negligence'. I am not sure that there is actually an offence under the Crimes Act. Negligence is generally a civil matter, a duty of care. I am sure that Senator Allison will take keen notice of what is involved in avoiding negligence. It usually means doing your homework first to avoid being held liable. There is a standard of care—maybe it is less for the Democrats. There are damages that flow. Your standing in the public opinion polls is usually dramatically reduced. But I do not think that, in the case of the Democrats, it should be a criminal offence. We simply accept the fact that they are entitled to have their say in a democracy.</para><para>Instead of trying to come in via the backdoor on this issue, Senator Allison ought to stand up and say whether she thinks we should ignore opportunities such as these, which come along once in a lifetime. Does she really believe that senior ministers in particular and any of those people with responsibility in certain areas should simply stay at home, put their feet up, watch it on telly and say, `Didn't we have a great two weeks on the public purse?' I would have thought the much more responsible thing to do would be to take the opportunity to sell Australia's message and to make others aware that this is a very clever, high-tech, highly literate country in which there are boundless opportunities to invest, opportunities that should be of great attractiveness to them because Australia is by far the most appropriate regional headquarters if they want to access the Asia-Pacific region. I hope that in those circumstances Senator Allison will be able to leave home during the Olympics and actually get out and about to see whether there are some people around who are even prepared to talk to her about some of these issues and, if there are, to take advantage of the opportunity. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17087</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I have a supplementary question.

The draft report is just that, and I am not going to comment on a draft report. I am not going to be drawn into any comments on what it might or might not say. This is a routine audit of the outsourcing conducted by the government—outsourcing which it is a shame the opposition does not support, when you consider the benefits that outsourcing brings, especially to the IT industry, in which Senator Lundy supposedly maintains an interest. When you look at the fact that—by virtue of the outsourcing policy of the government—hundreds of millions of dollars are going to small to medium enterprises and when you look at the benefit to the IT industry generally, it is a shame that Labor does not come on board and support us on this instead of always nitpicking. It is interesting to look at what Senator Lundy has said on this: `Labor will continue its call for the government to ditch the IT outsourcing program.' That is an amazing comment from an opposition which finds itself in the year 2000. This shows that Labor wants to go backwards in relation to the IT industry. The reforms that we are bringing in are also savings.

It is a very astute question because violence is a pervasive part of the lives of many people, especially, sadly, those of young men. Young men sadly do get far more than their fair share of violence. Bureau of Statistics figures showed that young men aged between 15 and 19 made up 13 per cent of victims of violence, but they are only 4.5 per cent of the population. So 4.5 per cent of the population has to cop 13 per cent of the violence. The federal government recognises this disproportionate representation of young men as victims of violence and last year, in quite a serious fashion over a day and a half to two days, consulted 22 young men who had experienced violence either as victims or as perpetrators, or as both. Violence had touched the lives of these young men in a number of ways, either directly, as I say, as victims or perpetrators in their families or schools or the public places where they meet their friends. Both the victims and the perpetrators in the group recognised that violence diminished their lives in a very permanent and long-lasting way.

The report from the group indicated these young men wanted to change their lives and avoid violence. They recognised they had an antagonistic relationship with the police and wanted that to change. They recognised their anger was a problem for them and for the people close to them, and they want to learn how to manage it. They wanted to make drugs harder to get—and I am sorry that Natasha is not here—because they did not think drugs were fun; they thought drugs and alcohol were a cost to their health.

This means that 89 per cent of children aged two to five are now protected against measles, mumps and rubella, an increase from 82 per cent before the campaign.</para><para>A subsequent evaluation of this very successful campaign identified young people between 18 and 30 as another at-risk group for not only measles but also rubella and mumps. Ninety per cent of cases during last year's measles outbreak in Victoria were of people aged 17 to 27. People in this age group not only are more at risk of acquiring an infection but also are at higher risk of complications when they do get infected. A report of an outbreak in Western Australia in 1994 stated there was a high morbidity rate in young adults, and last year's Victorian outbreak had a high rate of hospitalisations.</para><para>This issue should be above politics. But, unfortunately, as we have seen so many times, when it comes to the nation's health care, the Labor Party consistently fails Australians. Labor's failure to adequately address immunisation in its so-called policy will risk returning us to the bad old days when Australia's immunisation levels saw us ranked 68th in the world. It is disappointing to me that the Labor Party included only four lines on immunisation in its health policy platform. This is an obvious reflection of Labor's commitment to immunisation and protecting the community against vaccine preventable diseases. It is just another Labor failure. Labor has failed yet again to show the people of Australia that it does consider immunisation a priority. It was this government that linked immunisation to the principles of Medicare. Four lines of policy just is not good enough.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>17094</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force Academy</title><page.no>17094</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>17094</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Hogg asked me about the Australian Defence Force Academy and what plans the government had in relation to that.

It has been disastrous. Under this government, research and development tax concessions have been cut back from Labor's 150 per cent to just 125 per cent. This has been a major contributing factor to the decline in Australia's business expenditure on R&amp;D, a drop of some nine per cent in 1998-99 from the levels of 1995-96. This government has itself identified the need to encourage industry investment in research, despite its crazy decisions to cut research and development tax concessions.</para><para>Last December the government produced a white paper which was entitled `Knowledge and innovation', the purpose of which we were told at the time was in large measure to provide strong incentives for industry collaboration within higher education—within our universities. This white paper—the one that the government constantly relies upon in its own defence of research policy, as we saw here again today—in fact lays the foundations for the chaos in this crucial area of research—that is, research training. The white paper sets the scene for a voucher system in the area of university teaching and learning, a system where the funds follow the students. This is an unstable method of funding and one strongly opposed by most players in the Australian research policy scene. It works against the build-up, the nurturing, of a strong, sound and robust research and research training environment, because it does not guarantee that funding in any one institution will remain predictable and secure.</para><para>The government's new model for research training also involves a cut of some 3,500 research student places at Australia's universities. Currently there are some 25,000 full-time equivalent students undertaking research degrees in Australia. Every one of those young—and not so young—researchers is of incredible value to Australia's future as the knowledge nation. If we are to compete in a global environment we must urgently boost our research output and lift our human resource infrastructure for research and development, yet the government in its particular wisdom has decided to cut the number of funded places for research students from 25,000 at present to just 21,500.</para><para>This cut is not evenly inflicted across the board. What we have seen is a crucial differential impact across the system. The cut will deal a body blow to the newer, often bolder and more innovative of the smaller universities. It will hit hard at our regional universities. It will strike at the heart of the research schools of those universities struggling to establish themselves. This cut will also create a swathe through the research schools of those universities that are outside the privileged circle of the sandstone group of eight. While the group of eight will lose just 10 places altogether, the newer and smaller universities will lose 3,470 places. This is because the cut is being inflicted on research student places that are subject to HECS; research places created by the universities themselves. They are outside the mainstream Australian postgraduate system, APA. The new universities have, in a bid to establish themselves as research institutions, stuck their necks out and used some of their HECS related student places to boost research funding. They had to do this so that they could compete with their older and more established counterparts. Under the allocating system currently in place, these newer universities have been competitively disadvantaged. This is because their allocation of research student places has essentially been based on their past performance in research. Many of the measures used to assess research performance are themselves based directly or otherwise on a research track record that does not go very far back into the past.</para><para>This government essentially is seeking to accentuate that disadvantage. The newer universities will suffer quite savage cuts. Deakin University, for instance, will lose 224 places out of its current 525 places. The University of Western Sydney will lose half of its 687 total places. Central Queensland University will lose more than half of its research student places. The Australian Catholic University will end up with only one-third of its current number. All these universities have developed exciting, new, innovative programs in research in both the management and social science areas. They should not be disadvantaged in this way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>17096</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am surprised to be back here again, one day later, to speak on education issues.

But what we have here is, compared with that time, a massive improvement in funding for all universities. Back in the Whitlam era, funding was totally dependent on the budget. I was working in the sector at that time. We had a constant decline in standards, in ratios, in the actual funding for research. It was only when the Labor government finally were mugged by the reality that they did not have enough money to fund higher education—particularly as they had 50,000 people waiting to get in the door—or were not prepared to do it under their budgets that they reluctantly looked at other sources of income for universities. Since that time we have had a fee system, HECS, which is a very fair system of administering funding in universities. HECS now is regarded as being a world leader and is copied by other countries. The other thing that has happened is that more money has come in through overseas students and through industry research. Collaborative research systems like CRCs have been set up. All this has brought a lot more money into higher education—and, indeed, a lot more money into this field—since we came into government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Carr constantly chooses to ignore that there is a very large segment of private money coming into university sectors. There actually is $900 million more in the university sector now than there was when the Labor government left office. This is something Senator Carr chooses to ignore. He focuses only on the public part of the equation. He does not take into account the total amount of money, public and private, that has gone into our university sector—a record $9 billion. Our universities increasingly were freed up to use money in various ways under the Labor government and have been even more so under this government. There is enough money in universities to do these things—to fund the undergraduate places and to fund the research. Indeed, the huge queues to get in the gates of universities have largely disappeared. Last year we brought down a green paper on the research area. There was widespread discussion on that paper. It then became a white paper and was widely accepted across the sector as being the way forward on research. We strengthened the role of the Australian Research Council as an allocative mechanism for high quality research funding, and we made special provision in that for the regional universities. In addition, since that time there has been an increase in the amount of private money coming into universities.</para><para>Senator Carr gets up here and tries to run scare campaigns as usual. He does not take into account the fact that universities like the University of Melbourne now are only about half reliant on the public sector for their money. They get in a lot of private money. They have some degree of discretion as to whether they put this money into research or into other parts of the university's operations. The news out there in the universities is that the situation is improving, that there is more money—as a matter of fact, there is a record amount of money in the universities. What we have had here today is yet another scare campaign by Senator Carr on another area. Not only is he trying to mislead the Senate; he is trying to mislead the whole nation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>17097</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If we do have a record amount of money flowing into universities around the country in this day and age, why did we have, in Dr Kemp's leaked cabinet document last year, eight regional universities specified as being under threat and as suffering because of the policies of this government? Let us have a really close look at what has happened at the Northern Territory University in the last 10 months. The Northern Territory government has had to bail it out to the tune of $7 million. How did that happen when, if you are to believe Senator Tierney, there is so much extra money swilling around in the barrels of higher education?</para></talk.start><para>On Monday the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Research and experimental development: all sector summary: Australia</inline> which showed that Australia's expenditure on research and development has plummeted by 10 per cent. So investment in research and development, as analysed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has plummeted by 10 per cent; we have had a 10 per cent fall in growth expenditure on research and development, which is a damning indictment of a government that is holding back Australia's science and innovation based industries. Coupled with that, we have the white paper on research that has now been released. It started last year as this government's green paper. It has been translated into a white paper, and we now know it shows that this government plans to reduce the number of funded places for higher degree research students by 3,500 at the beginning of next year. So next year there will be 3,500 fewer places for higher degree research students—from 25,000 down to 21,500.</para><para>Under that scenario, the universities which again will be hit the hardest will be technological universities, regional universities and new universities. This represents a further disinvestment in our research capacity and capability at a time when we need investment in new knowledge, in our economy, in new industries, in new research and in new development. That is becoming an increasingly urgent imperative. </para><para>Let us have a look at the effect this will have on some of those regional and new universities. The government's white paper on research clearly stated that the minister intends to reduce the funded load for postgraduate research places from 25,000 down to 21,500. But neither the minister nor DETYA, firstly, have ever provided any real reason or evidence for why the line was drawn at 21,500 places and, secondly, have ever been able to specify why removing 3,500 places from the industry was in the national interest in terms of investment in research and development. On the contrary, it seems to run counter to all the government's rhetoric about the knowledge economy. </para><para>Let us have a look at exactly what this government's record is on generating and developing ideas when it comes to research and development. Since 1996, $1 billion in government funding has been taken from our universities. Dr Kemp's research white paper will slash the number of PhD places starting next year. The government's own science and technology budget admits that the Commonwealth investment in research and development has fallen by more than one-sixth; that was in the budget papers. We now know, because of the ABS statistics, that that is in fact one-tenth. In the Northern Territory University, this policy alone cuts the number of postgraduate research students that will be taken into the university next year from 34 to only 10. What does that mean? That means if they want to find the balance of those places, they have to go looking for them and find them around the country. That will not happen. This is a grave blow to regional universities. It limits the Territory's ability to compete as a knowledge centre. They need those dedicated places in their own right. Thirty-four was low enough as it was, let alone decreasing it to 10. But places like the regional universities will have no guarantee of being able to compete with southern universities for further spots. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>17098</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—All we see from the Labor Party these days, in the absence of any sustainable policy on their own part, is an attempt to scaremonger and create misinformation in the community about the good things that the Howard government is doing. We now see this occurring in this debate on education and research, in particular on higher education institutions. The fact is there has been no cut in postgraduate research places, as the Labor Party suggest. I think they suggested there has been a cut of 3,500 places in postgraduate research. In fact, the government is not cutting the number of places it funds, and it is not reducing the funding for those places. The gap between the number of Commonwealth funded research places—which is approximately 25,000, it should be noted—and the number of HECS exempt research scholarships, 21,500, has arisen because the institutions have diverted funds from undergraduate places to offer research places on a HECS liable basis. The unfortunate fact is that a significant number of those students never complete that postgraduate work involved in those research places. So let us put the lie to this claim by the Labor Party that it is the government that is reducing funding and the number of places in postgraduate research. The government wants to ensure that universities have incentives to properly manage their research places while ensuring there is access to those institutions for undergraduate students. </para></talk.start><para>Under the new framework announced in `Knowledge and innovation', the government's white paper on university research and research training, universities have the flexibility to revert their additional research places back to undergraduate places or to retain them as research places for re-allocation into a funding pool where universities win places based on their performance. Another of the initiatives in the `Knowledge and innovation' framework is a regional package which will assist universities to develop regional connections, foster a shift towards more entrepreneurial frameworks and concentrate research activity in areas of strength, assisting institutions to take advantage of opportunities presented through new fields of research. In that regard, the government has provided significant funding. There is $6 million provided under this package as a dedicated fund to support the research and research training activities of regional universities, in particular, and to assist their transition to the new funding system. A further $10 million a year is being provided for collaborative research on issues of benefit to regional communities. So there is a significant initiative there on the part of the government to ensure a greater commitment to research training in universities.</para><para>The government has continued to lift targeted public funding for university research in real terms from $411 million when we came to office in 1996 to $452 million in the current year, while also seeking to leverage increased private funding from industry. Since 1996 the government has announced increased funding for higher education research—additional funding totalling some $350 million by the year 2004. This includes an additional $62.9 million in this year's budget for the Strategic Partnerships with Industry—Research and Training Scheme from 2002 to 2004 and a further $16.3 million for the Research Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities Scheme from 2001 to 2004. As I said, research funding is up by some $40-odd million over the four years this government has been in office compared with the record of the previous Labor government.</para><para>With regard to ABS statistics, the ABS bulletin <inline font-style="italic">Research and Experimental Development, Australia, Higher Education Organisations</inline>, which came out a couple of months ago, showed that total expenditure on higher education research and development is estimated to be $2.6 billion—an increase of 13 per cent in just two years.

When it comes to the issue of funding research and development, the words `criminal negligence' I believe are apt to describe the actions of this government since it came to office in 1996. The pathetic defence that is used by Senator Tierney and Senator Chapman demonstrates that they have absolutely no understanding, no appreciation nor do they care about the importance of research and development to this nation in the world today. We note at least that the Prime Minister has some understanding of this because when he discussed with Dr Alan Greenspan, the Secretary of the US Treasury, what the reason was for the great success of the US economy over the past number of years, Dr Greenspan replied, `I have to say that the investment the United States has made in technology has been one of the main reasons why there has been so much sustained economic growth in that country.' It is a pity that this government did not take notice of Dr Greenspan's words and do something positive about research and development and investment in both the public and the private sectors.  </para></talk.start><para>As has been pointed out today in questions to the minister, the real facts are that Commonwealth investment in R&amp;D in 1996 was of the order of $1.26 billion. In 1999, it was $1.19 billion—a reduction in Commonwealth investment. They are the real figures, not these trumped up statistics that Senator Chapman and Senator Tierney are throwing around, trying to disguise the real situation. We also know, as was pointed out by Senator Crossin, that when this government first came to office it ripped $1 billion out of the university sector. Senator Vanstone was the then minister. She did such a hopeless job trying to manage that portfolio that she was kicked out of cabinet and demoted to a junior ministry. Unfortunately, Dr Kemp has carried on, in an even far more ruthless way, the legacy that was left by Senator Vanstone. </para><para>In terms of business R&amp;D, given the government has been reducing its investment in universities and R&amp;D, it makes a big play about the role of the private sector. What has been the role of the private sector? I want to quote from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a noted research organisation. If this government has its way, it will probably outsource or sell off the ABS one of these days. This is what the ABS had to say in their publication on 3 July: </para><quote><para>Research and development (R&amp;D) undertaken by Australian businesses decreased for the third consecutive year in 1998-99.</para><para>Figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show estimates of business expenditure on research and development (BERD) were down 5 per cent in current price terms compared with 1997-98 and 9 per cent compared with 1995-96.

They also point out the decrease in R&amp;D expenditure in key industries such as mining and manufacturing. So this government has presided over decreases in R&amp;D in not only the Commonwealth sector but also the private sector. Prior to it coming to office, as the ABS, a noted independent research organisation, states, it was increasing under the previous Labor government. So there is no doubt that this government is involved in dumbing down R&amp;D right through the Australian education sector. It has happened in the universities, and it is now happening in the CSIRO.

This will mean that the best mix of care is available to meet the health care needs of these clearly disadvantaged people. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Leadership in Health</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth's role in health is to provide strong national leadership in a collaborative process of health sector reform aimed at developing a strong population health approach to disease prevention, health promotion and education; to improve the availability of high quality, integrated and cost effective services with a strong consumer focus; and to develop a sound evidence base to support population health measures and clinical care and treatment. </para><para>The Commonwealth provides leadership through working collaboratively with stakeholders to develop broad policy frameworks and through both the provision of funding and the purchase of services. </para><para>The Government's reform agenda is consistent with the main thrust, and many of the recommendations, of “Rocking the Cradle” in that it aims to enhance continuity in care for consumers, to remove artificial barriers, and to encourage collaborative arrangements between health care providers at the community level.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Private Health Insurance</inline></para><para>The Government is continuing to improve the attractiveness of private health insurance to the Australian population through key reforms that address affordability of premiums, innovative products and structural reform of the sector.  These reforms increase the level of patient choice in health care for all Australians.</para><para>The 30% rebate on health insurance premiums has addressed the issue of affordability for all Australians.</para><para>Lifetime Health Cover builds on the existing community rating system through a new, fairer and workable lifetime approach to health insurance cover.</para><para>The Government can also increase the attractiveness of the private health insurance product through regulatory change.  Steps have been taken to expand the models of care available to the privately insured that have previously been unavailable such as early discharge and hospital in the home care.</para><para>Industry efficiency benefits patients and their choice of care.  A consumer strategy focusing on greater patient education and information is underway.  Key features include a statement of what can be expected when holding private health cover and a trial of a consumer hotline are the first steps.</para><para>Through these and other reforms, the Government is active in ensuring the Australian population has a choice in health care.  This is of particular importance with respect to all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Alternative Birthing Services</inline></para><para>The Report commends the contribution that the Commonwealth has made towards the promotion of consumer choice in birthing services through providing incentive funds for the establishment of birthing centres in States and Territories under the Alternative Birthing Service Program.  ABSP funds also contributed towards the establishment of culturally appropriate birthing services for Indigenous women.  The Report places particular emphasis on the provision of culturally appropriate and comprehensive antenatal information for individual women according to their ethnicity and cultural backgrounds.   </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Evidence Base</inline></para><para>The Government has given priority to investing in research and information which will maximise the quality of services and the effectiveness of the health system.</para><para>The Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care has recently been established by all Health Ministers as a means of coordinating national actions to build upon the many safety and quality improvement activities taking place around Australia.  The new Council is a national partnership between governments, health care providers and consumers. It will contribute to improvements in the safety and quality of care for patients and help reduce the risk of adverse events. </para><para>The National Institute of Clinical Studies, which will be established by the Commonwealth Government later this year, will also play a role in improving the quality of health care in Australia and ensuring the health system is underpinned by world's best clinical practice.  The Institute will work closely with stakeholders to identify, develop and promote best clinical practice throughout the public and private sectors. </para><para>The Government has also invested in improvements to national information and data with a major focus being on the role of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. One of the particular activities that are funded through the auspices of AIHW is the National Perinatal Statistics Unit (NPSU). The NPSU has developed a number of data systems on women's reproductive health services and pregnancy outcomes services that cover the period from conception to birth and up to one year.  The NPSU publishes regular reports on mothers and babies including a separate report on Indigenous mothers and babies.</para><para>Research into the effectiveness of interventions, the development of best practice guidelines by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the co-sponsorship of the Australasian Cochrane Centre by the Government are contributing to the increase of knowledge and improving the basis for decision making. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Commonwealth Funding Assistance to State and Territory Governments for Health Care   </inline></para><para>For the greater part, the Report recommendations are concerned with service delivery issues which are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.  This observation was made in the minority report by Government Senators and included the comment that “the Federal Government should not be dictating to the States how they should be running services that fall within their responsibilities.”  </para><para>This view is consistent with the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, a statutory committee of the Australian Parliament.  In Report No 342 of November 1995 the JCPA Chairman stated:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee believes that the Commonwealth needs to have a clearer focus on strategic planning and articulating SSP (Specific Purpose Payment) objectives in the community... the Commonwealth should progressively disengage itself from SPP micro-management, leaving this task to state governments and other non-Commonwealth parties to SPP agreements.  Primary accountability (by funded parties) to the Commonwealth should increasingly be for outcomes achieved rather than for inputs and processes.</inline></para><para>The Committee went further in Recommendation 3 of the same Report ie:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth departments administering SPPs involving more than one level of government should ensure that the SPP agreements do not prescribe the method of service delivery by another level of government.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements</inline></para><para>In line with the JCPA recommendations the Commonwealth Government contributes towards the capacity of individual States and Territories to maintain and improve the general level of Australia's health through broad Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs).  The base funding in the PHOFAs resulted from the broadbanding of Commonwealth funding to States and Territories for eight established public health programs (SPPs), including the National Women's Health Program and the Alternative Birthing Services Program.   </para><para>The current PHOFAs are for a five-year period, 1999-2004 and will provide in excess of $900 million to States and Territories during that time. They focus strategically on maintenance of effort through the specification of annual performance reporting requirements for population health outcomes relating to the incorporated SPPs.  State and Territory Offices of Health and Aged Care collaborate with State and Territory Health Authorities in monitoring and reporting performance under the PHOFAs at the local level. The annual performance reports from the States and Territories are published on the website of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. </para><para>These funding Agreements are designed to provide States and Territories with the flexibility to `mix and match' Commonwealth financial assistance to meet the varying needs of their respective populations while at the same time ensuring that the States and Territories remain part of a nationally coordinated effort in areas of high national priority. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Funding of Services</inline></para><para>Commonwealth funding for public hospitals is provided through the 1998-2003 Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs). The Agreements are a vehicle both for committing Commonwealth funds to public hospital services delivered by the State and Territory Governments, and for instigating reform in the funding arrangements for acute health services.</para><para>Under the AHCAs the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance to the States and Territories to meet the cost of public hospital services. Over the life of the Agreements, the States and Territories will receive total funding of around $31.3 billion, representing a 25 percent real increase in funding over the five years to 2002-03. State and Territory Governments have responsibility for, and indeed, are in the best position to, make decisions about the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including for the provision of obstetric services to women in rural and remote areas.</para><para>In addition to the core funding arrangements, the AHCAs also commit the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to working in partnership to achieve agreed health service delivery reform and set out a number of specific areas where reform of the health system and its funding may be advanced, including:</para><para>·	integration of care through measure and share arrangements;</para><para>·	information technology reform;</para><para>·	more responsive funding;</para><para>·	additional funding in the area of quality improvement and enhancement;</para><para>·	funding for the establishment of a National Health Development Fund.</para><para>The Government is also a major funder of prenatal and birthing care through Medicare payments for a wide range of antenatal, peri-natal and birthing services for pregnant women, apart from those using birthing centres or public patients using hospital based services. </para><para>In 1998-99, $57.7 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 1.55 million obstetrics services.  In addition, in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 514,014 ultrasound in pregnancy services.</para><para>Private health insurers are also a major source of funding for all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.  While an indepth consideration of the role of the private insurance providers was not included in the Committee's Terms of Reference, Committee members did acknowledge that the availability of private health insurance is providing many women with real options in antenatal care and birthing services. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Initiatives of this Government across the spectrum of funding of States and Territories, private health insurance, rural health, Indigenous health and quality in health provision have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before.  In this environment, the Government is confident that the relevant decision-makers can assess the recommendations of the Report “Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures.”.</para><para>While the delivery of medical and midwifery services is the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities, as well as clinicians in their support of patients, the Government has endeavoured as far as possible to provide responses to individual recommendations in this Report from the Opposition Members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee.

The report itself raises some very important questions, and in some ways I appreciate having, in this response from government, a fairly clear description of what I think is a major area of difficulty. One of the things our report found was that Australia was a country with one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, and that if you were privately insured you were much more likely to have a caesarean section than if you were a patient in the public sector. Evidence provided to the committee showed there was no clear reason why that should be the case.</para><para>I received a report today, Thursday 31 August—I think it is probably off my email—which said that, in the United States, after years of decline, caesarean sections are on the rise again. The evidence in the report from America is extremely similar to what we found in our report: that there is a very big difference between caesarean section rates across the country and that there is a much higher likelihood of caesarean sections for women if they are privately insured than if they are public patients. That seems to me to be, first of all, worthy of very serious investigation and follow-up. The government's response says:</para><quote><para>Most of the views and recommendations of the Report however, are in the realm of State and Territory Government responsibilities or comment upon clinical decisions. The Government does not consider that this form of inquiry—</para></quote><para>presumably a Senate inquiry—</para><quote><para>is best suited to assess quality, safety and relevance in clinical matters.</para></quote><para>It says four paragraphs later:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Approaches to Improving Australia's Health System</inline></para><para>The Government is funding and driving programs of health system improvement on a scale greater than has been seen in Australia before. Criteria of quality, safety, relevance, choice, equity of access and effectiveness based on evidence are paramount. This Response to the Report outlines some relevant initiatives.</para></quote><para>My first-up confusion about this is that paragraph 1 says that quality, safety and relevance are judged as clinical matters and outside the purview of a Senate inquiry, while paragraph 5 says that quality, safety, relevance, choice, access and effectiveness are criteria for the federal government's health policy. If we do not want to have a brawl, could I please have some further clarification? If, as the government say, they are concerned that quality, safety, relevance and choice, for example, are criteria by which you would judge an Australian health system but not this report because some of those applied to clinical matters, then I am nothing if not confused about what is the government's response in this area.</para><para>I am particularly concerned when they say that a lot of our recommendations go to things like how services are delivered in the states, but the states' way of delivering the services is outside the responsibility of the federal government. However, the federal government provide, through broad public health outcome funding agreements—PHOFAs—funding to state and territory governments and have agreements with them for delivering those services. If a caesarean section rate is not an outcome, what is it? If I seriously wanted to know how to judge in an appropriate way—without intruding on clinical professional decisions and without intruding on states' rights to do things—where Commonwealth dollars allocated to childbirth and delivery go in this country, then the way I measure this is in outcomes. What is the caesarean section rate if it is not an outcome? The caesarean section rate is merely data counting. It would be entirely proper for the federal government to be concerned about an outcome under their public health outcome funding agreements where caesarean section rates are higher in this country than anywhere else in the world and higher by a significant factor for privately insured patients and higher from one state to another. </para><para>My own state of South Australia, as I recollect, has the highest figure, or it did in the findings of our report. When we asked if that had anything to do with the state having the highest number of obstetricians, there was some concern that there might be a correlation. We concluded that, as they were the only people who could do caesarean sections, it was a very valid reason to worry. The American data shows just that. In fact, one college in America is concerned that the only differences between caesarean section rates are the practices and the habits of doctors. We were also told of one doctor who went to a large public hospital in South Australia and had set out to significantly lower the caesarean section rate. He was very successful in doing this. There was no increase in infant mortality or maternal damage. There was just a significant lowering of the caesarean section rate in the public hospital and, interestingly, an allied reduction in the caesarean section rate amongst the private practitioners in the environs of that hospital. We also heard that this same pattern happened when a senior obstetrician in Tasmania set out to look at the figures in Tasmania and to work with clinicians to see if that figure could not be lowered. I have been talking about caesarean section rates, but the figures are on the increase for all interventions in childbirth—be they episiotomies, vacuum extractions, the use of forceps, medication, epidurals, anaesthetics and so on.</para><para>I thank the government for the response, but I have to remark on the way they have said that a number of our recommendations belong in the state and territory area and that, therefore, the Commonwealth does not want to have much say about them. When the Commonwealth directly funds those programs with precious Commonwealth taxpayer dollars, I would like to know how the Commonwealth is so easily able to say, `We handball that to the states; it is not our responsibility.'</para><para>I heard, during question time today, considerable kudos being claimed for itself by the government, for how it has reduced through the immunisation program the number of people who have had measles, mumps, diphtheria and so on. The immunisation program is a classic Commonwealth-state program. It is a service delivered by the states, providing data to the Commonwealth, and it is a very good example—and I think the Commonwealth properly can claim some responsibility for reducing immunisation rates. But it does not do this by saying, `Don't talk to us about those figures; that is a state matter; we do not really have any responsibility for it.' Yes, the Commonwealth does have. It has clear responsibility under its own public health outcomes funding agreements. I want to know what they call `outcomes'. I am also concerned about how I can go to the estimates and find out how our Commonwealth dollars are being spent on health and on obstetric services. To be met by the Commonwealth saying, `Well, it's really a state matter—talk to them,' is not, I believe, a sufficient answer or justification. As I say, it is quite contrary to what they are claiming in the area of immunisation.</para><para>There are some other points here that I think are very important. The government clearly recognises the importance of our inquiry and agrees that some of the recommendations we have made should be picked up on, particularly where we have asked whether the NHMRC could pick up and develop the research, and so on. The Commonwealth also says—and this is a concern for me—that it has a very direct responsibility for something like, for example, ultrasound—and indeed this report tells us that in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of ultrasound. But they then go on to say that a lot of the ultrasound work is done in public hospitals, and that that is a state funding matter and not something that the Commonwealth would concern itself about.</para><para>I find that extremely disappointing, because half of the funding to our public hospitals is from the Commonwealth and also because the criterion for reasonable and decent ultrasound has to apply in the public as well as the private sector—and some of that is acknowledged by the Commonwealth in its response to other recommendations. Importantly, continuity of care—which we found so important in reducing caesarean section rates and in having happier mothers and happier babies—is certainly given support by the Commonwealth. The government says in its response that some of its funding is going very much into that kind of area, and so I acknowledge that support for the recommendations we made in that area. I think it was an invaluable report from the Senate. The government's response is largely positive but, as I say, its qualification about some of these matters being state government responsibilities does not hold water and does not assist with outcomes for Australian women.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>17114</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a few comments on the government's response to the report from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on childbirth procedures, called <inline font-style="italic">Rocking the cradle: a report into childbirth procedures</inline>. It is an interesting coverage that Senator Crowley, as chairman, has just given in the response to the response, in terms of dismissing the way in which the states are responsible for funding of these procedures. My comments when the report of the committee was handed down were the same as they were when the reference was put to the committee, and they are the same as those I will make today. These are issues that are within the responsibility of the states. That did not seem to matter; we still went ahead with the inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly enough, I suppose one should also draw attention to the fact that, while there is little doubt that caesarean section numbers have increased over time, if one were to listen to the Labor opposition senators one would think that that has only occurred since this government has been in office. It has not. The trend rates quite clearly show that the increase has been happening for many years. Be that as it may, why then, when Labor were in government for 13 years, did they not act—if it is possible now, according to Labor—to have it reduced? I do not understand that. Anyway, my answer to that is that there is no doubt that the rate is high. Evidence has shown that. But my question still remains: how do governments, or in fact Senate committees, change that? They cannot. The decisions on the procedures that people undergo at any time are the decisions of clinical practice and decisions that are made between doctors and patients: not through senators, not via ministers of health and not via governments—and may I say thanks very much for that; I am glad of that.</para><para>I want to make sure that the government position is clear on the way in which we have increased funding in so many areas. One of the most important things for the government is the committee finding of widespread satisfaction with the quality of birthing services available in this country. Maternal and infant mortality rates are the lowest they have ever been in Australia and they compare favourably with the rest of the world's, and that is solid proof that Australia's health policies are working. We should not be under any misapprehension about the level of satisfaction that exists.</para><para>The report identifies some concerns about access to antenatal services for women living in rural and remote areas. I just want to make sure that the Senate understands what has been done in that area, because much evidence was given of the concerns of rural and regional people. An amount of $49.5 million was allocated over four years in the 2000-01 budget to increase the range of allied health professionals working with GPs to meet locally identified needs. Another allocation of $48.4 million was made over four years to improve access to specialist services in rural and regional Australia—and that, I might add, complements the existing initiative to establish specialist training posts in rural areas, including four registrar posts in obstetrics and gynaecology that were funded in 1999. Another amount of $68.9 million was allocated to expand the Regional Health Service Program—and these centres in rural communities will draw together a flexible mix of service based on community need. Also, $102.1 million was allocated over four years to increase the number of GP registrars in rural areas. It is important to note that these things have all been done since the coalition government has been in office. They were not undertaken under the previous government over 13 years.</para><para>The report commends the contribution that the government has made towards promoting greater choice for women giving birth under the Alternative Birthing Service Program. As the report points out, the birth centres have been an outstanding success in terms of both medical outcome and consumer satisfaction. Many of the states and territories have continued to fund models that were initiated by the program. </para><para>But the government is particularly proud of a current initiative that it has put in place—and that supports rural women's access to appropriate antenatal information in their community. Under the fly-in female general practitioner service, about four times each year female GPs will visit up to 160 locations across the country where women do not have such local services.</para><para>This government also shares the concern of the committee about higher death rates for indigenous mothers and babies compared to the rest of the population. As a large proportion of indigenous people live in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are expected to be major beneficiaries of the new regional health strategy—and that has been particularly targeted for them and needs to be acknowledged.</para><para>The government has, I believe, demonstrated its commitment to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through recent initiatives. The 1999 budget, for example, boosted Commonwealth funding by $100 million over the next four years, most of which will be used to improve access for ATSI people to primary health care. This expansion of primary health care will support the continuation and improved development of antenatal and postnatal programs in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. For the first time also, national performance indicators and targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health have been agreed to by all Australian health ministers. These indicators include indigenous stillbirths, infant deaths and low birth weight. A strong emphasis on the Alternative Birthing Service Program has been to establish a culturally appropriate birthing service for indigenous women, such as the community based service for Koori women in Victoria.</para><para>I would draw the attention of senators to the fact that the recommendations in this report, as I mentioned before, are basically the words of opposition senators—and that is why the government senators provided the minority report in which we pointed out that most of the subject matter of this inquiry into childbirth procedures is, in fact, outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. The delivery of medical and midwifery services are the responsibility of state and territory health authorities—and we must not forget that. We must not start and try to intervene, as members of parliament or as governments, in those clinical practices. It is not the role of the Commonwealth to dictate how states and territories should be running services that fall within their responsibilities. The Labor government did not do it, we do not do it—and we do not see a future in making that a practice.</para><para>This government has good cause to be proud of the contribution it is making to enhancing childbirth outcomes for Australian families. Initiatives across the spectrum of funding to states and territories—private health insurance, rural health, indigenous health and quality and health provision—have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before. Clearly, this government is providing strong national leadership in this area and a broadly based structural reform.</para><para>I think Dr Wooldridge really does need to be congratulated for what he has done as health minister since 1996—and in consultation, in many respects, with Senator Herron, the minister for Aboriginal affairs. Both Dr Wooldridge and Senator Herron are medical practitioners. Both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by the indigenous population, and both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by rural and remote communities. They have spent many hours, many weeks, many months in fact, if you total it all up—the time in opposition and since in government—in making sure that their understanding of the requirements are known—and not only known but acted upon. I think this government really does need to be congratulated for the efforts it has put into allocating millions and millions of dollars and resources to give people in country areas and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities far better access to health across the board—not just in childbirth procedures. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>17116</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—The Deputy President has received a letter from a party leader seeking variations to the membership of a committee.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee as follows:</para><quote><para>Participating member: Senator Brandis</para><para>Substitute member: Senator Crane to replace Senator Brandis for matters relating to employment, workplace relations and small business from 7 pm, 31 August 2000 onwards.</para></quote></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>17116</page.no><id.no>R1088</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>17116</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>) agreed to:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>17116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>17116</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><quote><para>I am pleased to present this bill which highlights the government's continuing commitment to minimising the harm caused by tobacco smoking in Australia. Tobacco consumption continues to be a major burden on Australian society. Tobacco is the single largest cause of avoidable death and disease in Australia. The use of tobacco costs the Australian community $12.7 billion a year and around 18,000 Australians die every year because of smoking related illnesses.</para><para>In light of the continuing impact of tobacco consumption on Australia's health, the government believes the time has come to end all association of tobacco sponsorship and sport in this country. Tobacco advertising and sponsorship have been banned from domestic sporting competitions since 1992; however, major international sporting and cultural events can apply for an exemption to this ban.</para><para>When the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 was introduced, some exceptions were specified to ensure a moderate introduction of tobacco advertising bans in Australia. One of the most well-known exceptions to the ban is the section 18 exemption, which allows international sporting or cultural events held in Australia to have tobacco advertising provided certain conditions are met. There has never been an application for an exemption for a cultural event, and only a handful of sporting events continue to qualify for the exemption.</para><para>On the international stage, Australia is considered a world leader in tobacco control. In June 1999, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy endorsed a National Tobacco Strategy which provides a framework for all jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, to develop their own action plans for tobacco control. The government is committed to maintaining and improving on Australia's excellent track record in tobacco control by consistently implementing new initiatives. In 1998, the European Parliament voted for a ban on tobacco advertising, including a ban to be placed on sponsorship advertising of events or activities organised at a world level. This bill before you today is consistent with the decision made by the European Parliament and introduces the same time frames.</para><para>The phase-out of all tobacco advertising in Australia also represents a major contribution to the National Tobacco Strategy.</para><para>Tobacco advertising at any sporting or cultural event after 1 October 2006 under any circumstances. There is a transitional phase-out period between 1 October 200 and 1 October 2006. Prior to this phase-out period new events will be able to apply for a section 18 exemption. Any event to be held after the 1 October 2000 deadline will not be able to apply for an exemption. Between 1 October 2000 and 1 October 1 2006 events of international significance whose most recent application for exemption under section 18 was granted will be able to continue to apply for an exemption until the 1 October 2006 cut-off, provided that the event is completed before 1 October 2006. All applications received from events qualifying for consideration during the transitional phase will be assessed in the same manner as is currently provided for under section 18 of the Act. </para><para>After 1 October 2006 there will be no tobacco sponsorship or advertising at any sporting or cultural event in Australia. However, I am confident that event organisers will be working towards securing alternative sponsorship prior to the 2006 deadline. In the meantime I will continue to strengthen the restrictions applying to each event to ensure the public's exposure to the remaining forms of tobacco advertising is kept to a minimum.</para><para>This bill represents several years of negotiation with international motor sport, particularly the FIA—the Federation Internationale d'Auto-mobile—and the international Grand Prix Corporation. Australia, because of its relative geographic isolation, was always subject to being held hostage or to ransom by losing such events, a condition that was not placed on European countries. We have been able to negotiate an arrangement whereby with these time frames international motor sport has given undertakings that Australia will not be placed at any disadvantage in future negotiations, because it gives them time to arrange alternate sponsors.</para><para>This bill deserves the support of all Members and Senators. It will break the few remaining links between international sport and tobacco in Australia. The bill has received strong support from the health community, and it will provide the opportunity for all Australians to enjoy major international events even more, since they will no longer be associated with tobacco.</para></quote><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE SYSTEM</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>17117</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>17117</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate—</para><para>	(a)	notes, with deep concern, the Govern-ment's abrogation of its responsibilities for Australia's participation in the United Nations Human Rights Committee system;</para><para>	(b)	in particular condemns the Government for refusing to sign the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which the former Labor Govern-ment was active in initiating; and</para><para>	(c)	calls on the Government to reconsider this hasty and ill-considered action which will damage Australia's international reputation and its national interests.</para></motion><para>Tuesday was a sad day for Australia's international reputation and our national interest.

Now the government's `take our bat and ball home' response to the United Nations human rights system has abrogated that proud history and placed at risk our standing in the world.</para><para>The United Nation's Commissioner for Human Rights, a recent and popular visitor to Australia, Mary Robinson, says this is `tragic'. Mary Robinson is also right when she says that the government's reaction to scrutiny from the various human rights committees is `overdefensive'. But it is more than overdefensive. It is ill considered and petulant, and it harms Australia's reputation and damages our national interest. This is clear from the informed editorial comment in both yesterday's and today's newspapers. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> said:</para><quote><para>The Government needs to explain how its refusal to participate in the admittedly creaky infrastructure of internationalism in moral and human rights affairs fits with its insistence that Australia continues to reap the benefits of internationalism in economic affairs in bodies such as the World Trade Organisation.</para></quote><para>The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said:</para><quote><para>It is the stuff of tinpot nations who really do have something to hide, a rhetorical echo of the sort of ridiculous shenanigans performed by Iraq as it tried to evade the scrutiny of UN weapons inspectors. </para></quote><para>The Canberra Times said:</para><quote><para>The government has now succumbed to Howard-style populism and fear of Pauline Hanson.</para></quote><para>It is instructive that Australia's actions have received enthusiastic support from such international luminaries as the failed Minister for Sport and Tourism, Andrew Thomson, but that the former Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, who understands something about the way Australia is perceived in the world, has pointedly declined to support them. So has former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who said last week:</para><quote><para>Greater respect should be shown for the instruments of the United Nations. On this issue the United Nations have not been unreasonable. They were doing their job, which Australia in relation to other countries has supported. The United Nations should not be condemned for its somewhat gentle criticism of Australia.</para></quote><para>It is a shame that the government was not listening to those words of a former Liberal Prime Minister. Mr Thomson, the instant expert on the United Nations, appears to believe that non-government organisations, such as churches and charities among others—part of what he calls the `global NGO guilt movement'—have no place in raising issues of importance to them. Instead, in his latest hair-brained contribution to this issue, Mr Thomson said he would prefer to guarantee a veto for the coalition over any further Australian treaty commitment—a notion that, given his xenophobic view of the world, would lead to Australia's effective isolation from the international community.</para><para>It is disturbing in the extreme that in question time this week when the government was asked to disown Mr Thomson it pointedly declined to do so. The government has not fooled anyone, not the Australian people and not the international community, with its review of our involvement in the United Nations treaty system. This was a review announced in haste, a review conducted in secret and a review with no terms of reference. Instead, the various government officials charged with undertaking it received very firm riding instructions which left no doubt about what they were expected to conclude. There was no opportunity for the general public to participate in the review, which was precooked from the start.</para><para>The government did not even have the decency to inform the United Nations committees that they were being reviewed. Instead, like the Australian people, they had to rely on Mr Downer's somewhat hysterical press releases. At the very least, although no government offer has been received to do this, the Senate would expect all papers and documents submitted to the review to be tabled. Australia's vital interests are at stake here. It is intolerable that such secrecy should descend on the information that the government based its deliberations on. Public transparency is required. Respect for our parliament is also necessary. Indeed, to justify his stand, Mr Howard cannot invoke the defence that we are a democracy and then deny the democratic scrutiny that this chamber, the parliament itself and the community can bring to the undertaking of the inquiry he instructed to arrive at the conclusions it has.</para><para>The government's response on this issue has important implications for Australia's standing in the world. In signalling that it will be `more economical and selective' in its cooperation with United Nations human rights committees and, most particularly, in its refusal to sign and ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the government has effectively called a halt to Australia's leadership internationally on human rights issues. Under this government, it will no longer be possible for Australia to claim the high moral ground on human rights that Dr Evatt and others fought so hard to achieve for this nation. Worse than this, the government has left the world with a clear impression that Australia expects to continue to press for the protection of human rights internationally but will brook no international scrutiny of Australia's own performance. Needless to say, this will only undermine our capacity to make a more positive contribution to the advancement of basic human rights in the world. It is hard to see how we can hope to influence developments elsewhere when we expect to opt out of the same sort of scrutiny for ourselves.</para><para>During this period of UN phobia—which, you will recall, also included the government's decision, with no justification or explanation given, not to nominate Justice Elizabeth Evatt to serve a further term on the United Nations human rights committee—the government has squealed about Australia not deserving to be treated like an egregious human rights abuser in the international system. This argument is a straw man. No international observer believes Australia fits that category. It is therefore ironic—and, indeed, sad—that, in its defensiveness and in its petulance, the government's recent actions resemble those we have come to expect from the human rights abusers who seek to isolate themselves from international scrutiny. They are certainly not actions that befit a country with such a proud international record as we have—the proud international record of Australia. </para><para>The decision not to sign the CEDAW optional protocol, which the previous Labor government was instrumental in initiating, will dismay the international community, who will be left wondering how it is that Saudi Arabia, Namibia, Bolivia and Thailand can sign the protocol—which merely creates certain procedures that promote rights that are already guaranteed—while Australia cannot sign the protocol. I note that the OECD countries Germany, Italy, Norway and Mexico have also signed the protocol. Others have said that they intend to sign it. I believe Australia is the only country in the world that has pointedly said that it shall not sign it. The government stands condemned for its politicking on the issue of discrimination against women. So it can deliver the United Nations with the preordained `bloody nose' that the Minister for Foreign Affairs described and so it can win votes among the Hanson constituency, it has been prepared to isolate Australia on the world stage concerning global human rights issues. The opposition awaits the government's explanation to all Australian women and to the international community as to why Australia no longer wholeheartedly supports the international elimination of discrimination against women.</para><para>While on the subject of what Australia has not done, it is important to mention its guilty nation status when it comes to International Labour Organisation conventions. The eight central conventions of the ILO are, in the main, among the oldest human rights commitments Australia has made to the United Nations system. Most of them have been adopted by each Australian state as well as the Commonwealth before being adopted nationally and before being confirmed to the International Labour Organisation. Most are also incorporated in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, and all are now an important element in world trade talks. Thus, they reflect not only Australia's standing on human rights but also Australia's economic interests. Australia is in flagrant breach of two core conventions on the freedom of association and on the right to collective bargaining and is under notice that it is probably in breach of the convention on non-discrimination in the workplace. The ILO committee of experts has made that determination and has asked Australia to answer the charge. So far, Mr Reith has chosen to ignore this request by the oldest United Nations organisation. Thanks to Mr Reith putting guard dogs and balaclavas on the Australian waterfront and thanks to the Western Australian Court government's third wave of industrial legislation, Australia is now numbered among 21 nations guilty of breaking these conventions. It is unedifying company indeed and pushes our country towards a pariah status in the field of industrial relations.</para><para>The government's actions on the human rights committees—which, it should be emphasised, have no mandate to change Australian law or to impose sanctions upon Australia but merely scrutinise and comment on Australian practices in relation to human rights—send a signal to the international community that Australia is not wholeheartedly committed to meeting its international obligations and will opt out where it becomes politically expedient for the government of the day to do so. This is a sad, misguided and dangerous signal, which has damaged this nation and which will continue to damage our international standing.</para><para>I turn to no less an authority than a ranking international expert on global law, Professor Philip Alston, who is regarded as an expert on the UN treaty system. He is based in Florence, and he spoke this morning on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program. They introduced him as the brother of the communications minister known in this chamber, Senator Richard Alston. The ABC asked him about the United Nations committee system, which the government says needs a complete overhaul. He answered: </para><quote><para>The work is not nearly as bad as the Government suggests, but there are ways in which it could be improved and sometimes they get it wrong—as does any governmental or other system.</para><para>..		...		...</para><para>What would make all the difference would be the provision of enough resources to enable the UN to hire say four or five legal experts who would assist these various committees ...</para></quote><para>The ABC asked him a further question:</para><quote><para>Well the Government says it wants to work with the UN to improve the process. Is this withdrawal the way to improve it?</para></quote><para>Professor Alston answered:</para><quote><para>No, what's necessary in fact is for the government to be serious about its protestations that it wants the system to work better and for the government to try to make an effort to mobilise increased resources so that it really does work better.</para></quote><para>The ABC asked:</para><quote><para>As far as you know, is this the first time that a country has withheld its cooperation from the treaty process in this way?</para></quote><para>Professor Alston answered:</para><quote><para>There are a couple of other countries that have got very irritated and have threatened to withdraw. Unfortunately one of them is North Korea and of course the whole world was outraged at that. I'm not aware of any government which has suggested that it could determine entirely for itself the terms on which it will cooperate with the UN in the human rights area. If that sort of approach was adopted by other countries—China, Burma, Cuba, you name it—we would be outraged.</para></quote><para>He goes on to talk about how this stance by Australia will corrupt out position in the world system. Finally, the ABC asked him:</para><quote><para>To what extent will our change in policy weaken the UN system in general?</para></quote><para>Professor Alston answered:</para><quote><para>Change in policy will have a number of effects. First of all it won't do Australia any good in terms of its general standing, and finally and most importantly of course, the system can only be weakened when a respectable government like that in Australia indicates that it's no longer going to cooperate fully or properly with the UN system in human rights matters.</para></quote><para>His final comment was:</para><quote><para>We really are inviting some of the thugs of the world to come along and say, jolly good Australia, we're right with you. We also agree that we shouldn't have to be held accountable for our human rights records.</para></quote><para>They are the words of Professor Alston, an international expert in this field and brother of the Howard government's Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. They have considerable weight as an unsolicited testimonial to the shocking and disgusting position the government has taken on this matter.</para><para>I now want to say something about the opposition's approach to the issue. There is no question that the United Nations's human rights treaty bodies can be improved. This can be said of all national and international committees. But the answer does not lie in conducting secret, pre-cooked reviews and then withdrawing or limiting our involvement. Nor does it lie in behaving like an international pariah, hiding from the international spotlight, taking offence at the smallest slight, seeking to stifle non-government views—actions typical of a non-democracy—or blaming UN committees for what is, in the case of mandatory sentencing and other indigenous issues, simply the government's failure to act effectively on issues of concern to the majority of Australians. The answer lies instead in working openly and cooperatively with the committees to make clear Australia's perspective and responding to the wishes of the Australian community on issues of social concern so that Australians do not feel obliged to exercise their right to take up these issues with UN committees. The opposition deplores what the government has done and calls upon it to reconsider its actions, which are a blot on Australia's international reputation. </para><para>Before I conclude my remarks, let me draw them to finality by referring to yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of question time in the House of Representatives. Interestingly, Mr Andrew Thomson, who has put somewhat bizarre views into the public spotlight today and earlier in the week and has not been disowned by the government—who were invited to separate themselves from his position and declined to do so—asked the Prime Minister a question on this matter. The Prime Minister said in part of his answer, referring to the protocol: </para><quote><para>To date, only 43 states have signed the optional protocol, only five have ratified, and a further five need to ratify to bring it into force.</para></quote><para>It has to be said that 43 states having signed at this point is quite a credible outcome. If it only requires 10 nations to ratify it, we are only five short. Ratification is imminent, and Australia therefore appears to be isolated in the world because it is a non-ratifying nation. The Prime Minister has said that the US has not ratified it, but the US has announced its intention to ratify. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>17121</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is amazing.

I had the great privilege of being Australia's representative at the United Nations General Assembly in 1997 for three months. I came away from that experience very much of the mind that, despite all of the good work the United Nations does, there was enormous scope for reform. It was also very obvious from the commitment that Kofi Annan made when he took on his position with the United Nations that he also saw reform as the major goal of his period of tenure in that position. It is known around the world that there are huge areas in which the United Nations committee structure, in particular, needs reform. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, announced the review of the United Nations treaty committee system on 30 March this year, he made it very clear that Australia was not—I emphasise `not'—walking away from its international commitments nor disengaging from the United Nations system. His record, in particular, with regard to the Ottawa treaty and his commitment to de-mining is evidence of his belief in the system, in the sense that there are areas that are working and there are areas that are not working. To intimate that he would be walking away from the system I think denies his commitment to aspects of the United Nations which are positive and which are working and his commitment to ensuring that we support Kofi Annan in addressing the issues in the areas that need reforming.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This government is strongly committed to continued support for international human rights protection, as the outcomes of the review of Australia's interaction with the United Nations treaty system demonstrate. Our concern is that the United Nations human rights treaty committees are not working as well as they should or as well as they were intended to work and that the views of democratically elected governments, like our own, are not given due weight in these processes. The government will maintain its active engagement in the human rights treaty system and increase its efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the treaty committees. These measures that the government has taken are not about repudiating the United Nations human rights system but, rather, are about making the system work more effectively, both for democratic countries like Australia and for the United Nations as a whole.</para><para>As I said before, we have a strong record of active support for the United Nations. We have a strong human rights record and we take our international rights and obligations seriously. I remind the Senate that it was the coalition government that signed the initial Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983. However, the government does not think that it is appropriate to sign a new procedure, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women while concerns with the operation of the treaty system continue.</para><para>The government does not consider that the rights of women in Australia will be diminished at all by this decision, as Australia has put in place a world-class regime to protect women against discrimination. Australia's strong human rights record for women is widely acknowledged around the world, particularly at the recent meeting in New York of the Beijing +5 Conference. The government has played a leading role in supporting women's humans rights in the work of the United Nations. The government supports the Beijing platform for action and the outcomes document to further the advancement of women in Australia and around the world. As I said, we have an excellent record on women's rights, and that was acknowledged at that Beijing +5 Conference. </para><para>Women's human rights in Australia are fully protected and supported by the Howard government. Furthermore, Australia ranked third in the world in the 2000 United Nations Human Development Gender Index. We are committed to upholding and strengthening this record. We can look at some of the ways the government have improved the situation of Australian women since being in government. I have to give credit where credit is due. Many senior women were languishing in the diplomatic service before we came into government. I have forgotten quite how many women—I think it is in the order of 16—Minister Downer has appointed in his time to senior positions, either as consuls or ambassadors. He significantly increased the number of women in senior positions in the diplomatic corps.</para><para>More women are in the paid work force in Australia than ever before—65.9 per cent of working women were in the labour force in July this year. The women's unemployment rate is at its lowest rate in decades—six per cent in July this year. The government has a strong commitment to child care, despite the myths the Labor Party people on the other side put about. There has been an increase in child-care places. Those opposite tend to mention only the child-care centres which have closed down. The number of child-care centres was growing like topsy and there were too many in places where they were not needed and there were not enough in places where they were needed. The opposition fail to talk about the number of child-care centres that have opened; they talk about only those that have closed. That is selective attention, which the Labor Party are very good at. There has also been $900 million additional funding for a simpler and more generous child-care benefit. </para><para>We have seen an increase in those areas—employment, education and training, and facilitating the return of women to work. The coalition have shown enormous improvement in many areas that affect women. Another area where we have made significant inroads—and many women have commented on this—is superannuation. The Labor Party had ample opportunity to fix this area of gross discrimination. We brought in changes to superannuation in March 1999 which for the first time allowed divorcing couples to divide superannuation accounts in the accumulation phase. The reforms allowed divorcing couples to split their superannuation in whatever proportions they wished to best meet the current and future needs of both parties, and protected the retirement living standards of older Australians.</para><para>I could go on at length about the way in which we have improved the lot of women in the very short time we have been in government. We have committed $50 million to the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program. I had the opportunity last week to visit in the western district of Victoria a number of centres which have received grants. I know how important those grants have been to research some of the causes of domestic violence—an area that was grossly neglected under the previous government. And I could go on.</para><para>It is obvious to the chamber that Labor is seeking to use this issue to have cheap shots at the government. The Australian Labor Party is happier attacking Australia than defending it. It feels very comfortable in making invidious comparisons between Australia's constructive attempts to reform the UN treaty system and the responses of Iraq and Burma on their human rights records. This was made evident in a doorstop interview yesterday by Mr Laurie Brereton. Surely the Labor Party is not unaware that the treaty body reform is long overdue? In 1999 alone, 1,146 reports were overdue under the six human rights treaties that operate in international law and it was estimated that 2,500 pieces of correspondence to the Human Rights Committee were awaiting reply. </para><para>And Labor says we should throw more money at it. That is Labor's solution to everything—spend more money. Maybe we need to reform the system rather than spend more money. The only solution Senator Cook suggested to us in the chamber today was that we get five more lawyers—or whatever he was suggesting—and it will all be fixed; rather than looking at productive and sensible ways that could actually make this system work so that it is not bogged down by correspondence and by reports that are overdue. We need to be focusing on the real breaches of human rights and the real issues that all of us understand as issues which need addressing by the international community.</para><para>I think the Labor Party are indulging in absolute hypocrisy in pursuing this issue and this exercise. The ALP are on the record as recognising the deficiencies of the existing human rights machinery. If you look at their policy manifesto, <inline font-style="italic">Labor Platform </inline>2000, it states:</para><quote><para>Labor will devote particular attention to strengthening and improving the UN human rights machinery and processes.</para></quote><para>Let them tell us how they are going to do it. All we have heard from Senator Cook today is `spend more money; put a few more people in there'. Over the years, together with Canada, New Zealand and Norway, Australia has made a number of statements on treaty body reform and effective implementation of human rights treaties. These statements have been provided to the international community in the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, and Australia has co-sponsored resolutions in these various fora.</para><para>In December 1997 the principal theme of the Attorney-General's address to the Implementing International Human Rights Conference at the ANU in Canberra was treaty body reform. In January 1998 Australia provided substantive written comments to the United Nation's Alston report on the long-term effectiveness of treaty body reform. In mid-1998, Australia, Canada and New Zealand submitted a joint paper to the Human Rights Committee containing suggestions for reform of some of the committee's rules of procedure. In May 1999 the Australian Ambassador in Geneva called on the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Mary Robinson, and delivered to her a letter outlining the government's concerns with the operation of the treaty bodies and indicating Australia's approach to reform.</para><para>The motion refers to `Australia's hasty and ill-considered action'. It is not hasty and ill considered. We have been concerned about this for years. I have just listed a number of ways in which we have tried to alert the UN to our concerns. More recently, in June 1999, Australia provided comments to the Bayefsky and Heyns study on the operation of treaty bodies commissioned by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson. In October 1999 we presented a well-received paper on treaty reform to a meeting of the International Commission of Jurists in Copenhagen. In February 2000, building on the interest generated by the Copenhagen meeting, Australia convened a meeting of like-minded countries at the Australian mission to discuss ways and means of taking the reform further. This is not a hasty reaction.</para><para>It is therefore clear that the government has shown an interest in the reform of the United Nations treaty committee system, and it is not a new interest. The government has been a committed leader in this process for a number of years. Seeking to review the United Nations treaty committee system does not amount to Australia walking away from its international obligations or disengaging from the United Nations system. This government continues to support the UNHCR program for the resettlement of refugees and Australia is one of the world's most generous resettlement nations for refugees per capita in the world. In the last program year we resettled in the order of 12,000 persons under our refugee and humanitarian program. So we have evidence of our support and of our strong commitment to the reform of the system in order for us to focus on areas of human rights and human rights abuses which the world condemns.</para><para>It is here that I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the editorial from today's edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> titled `Canberra has the right to condemn UN', which states: </para><quote><para>The Government stands accused of jeopardising the cause of global human rights.</para></quote><para>What does it then say? It states:</para><quote><para>Rather it should be applauded for having the guts, as a voice of democracy, to stand up and fight a UN system that has made the examination of human rights abuses bureaucratic, misguided and irrelevant.</para></quote><para>I think the number of letters that have not been answered and the number of reviews that have not been done demonstrates that. The editorial goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Non-government organisations hold too much sway with the UN committees and are accountable only to their vested interests. Democratically elected governments have too say. This must change. The biggest impetus for UN reform came when the US pulled out of UNESCO in 1984. We do not propose that Australia follows the US by reserving the right to accept only those UN decisions it likes. But we defend Australia's right to object to parts of the UN system that do not work. Australia's decision on the committees will do more for reform than any drawn-out tolerance of their flaws. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson says Australia's stance is overdefensive. No. Australia is demanding that the human rights records of all nations are judged on merit. Other UN officials accuse Australia of sulking and jeopardising its human rights record. Australia has worked harder than most to help make the UN work.</para></quote><para>Let me just repeat that: `Australia has worked harder than most to help make the UN work.' I must give credit here to Ambassador Penny Wensley, who has worked assiduously in addressing issues of UN reform. The editorial continues:</para><quote><para>We still take a leading role in UN projects where participating can—and in cases such as East Timor, does—make a difference. Any suggestion that our human rights record is at risk is absurd.</para></quote><para>I am quoting an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>.

They were saying the complete and utter opposite. So that is a real problem. Let us have a look at this treaty review. What is the treaty review on about? What happened? First of all, it was secret, very secret. Not only were there no public hearings—I do not know of any public submissions; nobody asked for submissions—but interestingly, and this is the first time I can remember this happening, when one of the subcommittees of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade asked for a briefing on what was going on with that treaty review, we were told that we could not have one; that it was in fact secret. We, the elected representatives of the Australian people, were therefore not allowed to know what was going on in it. So I think you can well and truly say it is secret.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that, as Senator Patterson said, the review was announced on 30 March of this year. If you think back, that was just after Minister Ruddock appeared before one of these UN committees in Geneva. The reviews that I heard from various bodies within Australia and around the world—not all of them evil NGOs, but some of them certainly from the NGO community—were very bad. In fact, I did not get one good review of that performance. It is very interesting that this review of our participation in the treaty system was announced very soon after that performance by Minister Ruddock in Geneva before a UN committee.</para><para>Interestingly, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has a UN subcommittee. We just formed it a little while ago. It will be looking into Australia's interaction with the UN and including in that our interaction with the treaty committee. Even more interestingly, we are actually an open and transparent body. We have asked for public submissions. We have got lots of them. We are holding hearings now, and we will undoubtedly come up with a report. I suspect that since this committee has members of all parties on it—it does have representatives of the government and also of the opposition and the Democrats on it—it will certainly be a lot less secret and a much more open, transparent and interesting read than Mr Downer's press release was. </para><para>Of course, we will never read the report of the treaty review, but we can read Mr Downer's press release that he put out when the treaty review was announced. I should just refer to a couple of things that Senator Patterson said, so we can see if they match up with Mr Downer's press release. Senator Patterson talked about Australia's constructive attempts to reform the UN committee system—so we are looking at constructive attempts here—and she said that these are productive and sensible ways in which we can make this system work. I cannot actually see too many of those in this press release, and this is the only release I have to tell me what has happened with this treaty review. But if we go through it we find it is interesting. One of the most interesting things is that the announcement was made not just by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General but also by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The three of them made that announcement. I am reading here from the press release from Mr Downer:</para><quote><para>The treaty review found that UN human rights treaty bodies need a complete overhaul especially:</para><para>(i) as regards the treaty committee system:</para><para>to ensure adequate recognition of the primary role of democratically elected governments and the subordinate role of non government organisa- tions ...</para></quote><para>Obviously, the government is very upset about NGOs. If you have a look at some of the submissions that NGOs have sent to the United Nations on such things as mandatory sentencing and refugees, you will find that they did not agree with the government. I think the government does not like the fact that people do not agree with it. We have seen many ways in which the government has punished people who do not agree with it. I fear that at the moment it is punishing not just the NGOs—it cannot really punish the NGOs too much with this—but the United Nations treaty system. The press release continues:</para><quote><para>to ensure that committees and individual members work within their mandates;</para></quote><para>That is an interesting one.

Improving coordination between committees is something that really needs to be done, and it is something on which the UN subcommittee of the JCFADT has had some very good evidence from people who have been involved in the UN committee system for a long time—some very constructive things, things that are not mentioned here, things that are not even considered here. In fact, I cannot see how getting out of the treaty system to the extent that this says we will is going to improve coordination between committees at all. It is not. It cannot possibly do that. The final point under (i) is:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>to address the current inadequate secretariat resources for research and analysis to support committees' work; and</para></quote><para>Absolutely right: those committees desperately need extra funding to have extra people to do more research and analysis to support those committees' work. They desperately need it. So if the government would like to come up with some of that funding I think that would be very useful. If not, if it would like to encourage somebody else to come up with that funding, I think that would be very useful. I guess it helps that Australia will be taking itself out of that treaty system to some extent, because it means the secretariat will not have anything to work on. But it surely does not help with international scrutiny of Australia—but I guess that is what the government is trying to stop, anyway. Part (ii) states:</para><quote><para>(ii) as regards the international protection system: </para><para>to ensure that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its Executive Committee (Excom) maintain their focus on their primary objectives;</para></quote><para>Why on earth would that be dot point No. 1? That is quite interesting. Secondly:</para><quote><para>to improve their operational effectiveness and responsiveness to states concerns; and</para></quote><para>Thirdly:</para><quote><para>to enable states to reassert their common understanding of international protection obligations.</para></quote><para>I cannot see how any of that is going to be helped by us getting out of the system. It does not seem to me to be a very useful response at all. The media release continues:</para><quote><para>Cabinet decided Australia's strategic engagement with the treaty committee system should be dependent on the extent to which effective reform occurs.</para></quote><para>Effective reform—hmmm! It goes on:</para><quote><para>In pursuit of reform the Government will take the following measures:</para><para>Australia will intensify work with other States on reform of the treaty committee system, including through a high level diplomatic initiative with Ministerial leadership and more strategic use of meetings of state parties, to address our concerns.</para></quote><para>Why on earth do you have to take yourself out of the system to do that? You do not. In fact, you are taking away from your own effectiveness if you do that. Secondly:</para><quote><para>Within the framework of Australia's continuing commitment to international human rights standards and monitoring—</para></quote><para>I am glad to hear that! It continues:</para><quote><para>the Government will adopt a more robust and strategic approach to Australia's interaction with the treaty committee system both to maximise positive outcomes for Australia—</para></quote><para>I am glad we are doing that!—</para><quote><para>and enhance the effectiveness of the system in general.</para></quote><para>I thought enhancing the effectiveness of the system in general would be enough but, no, we also have to `maximise positive outcomes for Australia'. That is very good! I would have thought the way to maximise positive outcomes for Australia would be for Australia to not go against any of our treaty obligations. That would be the most effective way of maximising positive outcomes for Australia. But I guess those within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General's Department and DIMA have not thought of that. Thirdly:</para><quote><para>Australia will immediately implement a package of measures to improve our continued interaction with UN human rights treaty committees ...</para></quote><para>How are we going to improve our continued interaction if we are getting out of it? I can tell you, because the minister goes on to say how we are going to improve our continued interaction:</para><quote><para>(a)	reporting to and representation at treaty committees be based on a more economical and selective approach where appropriate;</para><para>(b)	Australia will only agree to visits to Australia by treaty committees and requests from the Committee on Human Rights `mechanisms' for visits and the provision of information where there is a compelling reason to do so;</para></quote><para>So we are not going to invite anybody here. If they ask to come, we are going to say, `Go away,' and we are not going to give them any information. That will improve our continued interaction with UN human rights treaty committees! Hmm, I can't quite see how that will work, but obviously the Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks it will. To continue:</para><quote><para>(c)	 Australia will reject unwarranted—</para></quote><para>`unwarranted'; I wonder who works that one out—</para><quote><para>requests from treaty committees to delay removal of unsuccessful asylum seekers from Australia;</para></quote><para>We are back to immigration. We will be rejecting any unwarranted requests that we think we do not like. So, if the UN says that we should keep refugees here until something happens, we are going to say, `No, sorry. That's unwarranted.' And we have to say, `No, that person has to go back to be tortured, because that will improve our continued interaction with the UN human rights treaty committees.' Finally, (d). This is a real beauty—we have all heard about this one:</para><quote><para>(d)	Australia will not sign or ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which establishes a new complaints procedure.</para></quote><para>I do not think this has very much to do with the government's views on women. I think they are well known. I do not think this has much to do with that; I think this has to do with the government turning us into fortress Australia again. I think this has to do with the government not wanting anybody else to be allowed to look at this government's actions and determine whether this government's actions comply with this government's treaty obligations. Nobody imposes treaties on us; we agree to treaties. We sign and ratify treaties because we agree to them. </para><para>Does this government not understand how the treaty system in Australia works? I will tell it. The way it works is that we never sign a treaty until we are sure that all our legislation complies with that treaty. If it does not, then we put reservations on it. We say, `Okay, we won't sign part 27 or part 154 because our legal obligations to ourselves, the legislation we have written and enacted for ourselves, does not comply. We can't agree with that bit, but we agree with all the rest, because our legislation does comply.' So every treaty we have signed has Australian legislation to back it up. Or, if it does not have that legislation, it does not need that legislation. What is happening here is that when we go before treaty bodies we are being judged by our own standards. We are being judged on how we want to be seen. We have said, `We've signed this treaty. We have legislation that backs up this treaty. This is what we are doing.' It is not even what we aspire to; it is what we are doing. If a treaty body says, `Hang on a minute. We don't think you are doing that. We've looked at all the evidence, and you've got a problem here,' that is something we should treat very seriously. If someone independent, someone outside—not one person, of course, but many—looks at how we are behaving, according to our own standards, and says that we are found wanting, we should reconsider that. If they say we are found wanting, that does not mean that we should then take gross offence, pick up our bat and ball, and go home saying, `We're not playing this game any more. We've gone to huge trouble, over many years, to build this up. But you've told us that we're doing the wrong thing. We don't agree with you, so that's it. Goodbye. We're not even going to answer you, we're just going to go away.' That is so childish. Where are we—kindergarten? It is pathetic. It is a very childish response, and it is one I really do not want to be associated with. Finally, the minister says:</para><quote><para>In addition the Government will:</para><para>(a) undertake a comprehensive review of Australia's and other parties' interpretation and implementation of the 1951 Refugees Convention and consider the need for remedial legislation;</para></quote><para>Obviously this government has a real problem with refugees. Throughout this media release we see the words `immigration', `refugees' and `UNHCR'. We have seen many things that hark back to refugees and Australia's behaviour with refugees. I would agree that we do have a real problem with refugees; I just think it is a pity it is disguised within the minister's media release. The minister's media release goes on to say:</para><quote><para>(b) establish a standing inter-departmental committee jointly chaired by DFAT and AG's to progress reform of the treaty committee system—</para></quote><para>I hope that works. It does need reform. We should not walk away from it—</para><quote><para>and coordinate future interaction with the treaty committees;</para><para>(c)	 establish an inter-departmental committee chaired by DIMA to coordinate implementation of the reform strategy outlined in paragraph (a) above.</para></quote><para>It finishes with:</para><quote><para>Australia has long been an active proponent of reform of the committee system. We will build on this work and push for more intensive change. We will continue to work closely with other like-minded States and the UN.</para></quote><para>It is a pity that we are not going to continue to work closely with the UN in their treaty system.</para><quote><para>Australia has a strong history of active support for the UN—</para></quote><para>yes, we do; that is true—</para><quote><para>We have a strong human rights record and we take our international rights and obligations seriously.</para></quote><para>I am glad that the government have told us that, because, if they had not told us that, we would not have found out in the rest of this press release. The rest of this press release does not tell us that at all. In fact, the rest of this press release says one thing and then, in order to demonstrate that that is the case, says the opposite: `improving our continued interaction with UN human rights treaty committees' by getting out of them, by not allowing anybody to come here, by telling them to go away if they ask for information? That improves our continued interaction? How? It does the complete opposite. It cannot improve it. </para><para>The other thing is that it is so appallingly childish to say, `You can't come here.' It is not just appallingly childish; it diminishes us in the world community. This whole thing diminishes us in the world community. One of the great strengths of Australia in the human rights organisations of the world, including the UN, has been that up until now we have always been ready to welcome anybody here to see how we do things and examine us. We have been able to say to any other country on earth, `It is legitimate for us to talk about where you have problems'—and goodness knows there are an awful lot of countries on earth who have worse problems than us—`and it is legitimate for us to tell you where we think you are going wrong, because we are quite happy for you to do the same with us.' Up until now, we have been. I am absolutely ashamed of the fact that this government have taken that away, and I am really embarrassed that they have taken it away from me. I can no longer say that. I can no longer say that as an Australian when I go overseas. That is hugely disappointing. It is disappointing, it is embarrassing, it is terribly hypocritical of this government, it is shocking. I can barely think of words to say how badly I think of this. It is absolutely quite shocking.</para><para>Let me finish by saying that the UN subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is conducting a review of Australia's future position in the UN and where we are expected to go. It is a public inquiry. We have received a lot of submissions, some of them extremely impressive and from people who have worked in the UN for many years. We will be reporting in public, and we will come out with a press release. I will have a look at that before it goes out—I am sure I will be allowed to do that—and I will make sure that it does not say one thing and then demonstrate the complete opposite, so it will be a much nicer press release than the one that the minister has put out. I think Australians can look forward to the recommendations and the outcome of that committee. Unfortunately, because of the way our committees work, we will have a public inquiry, but it may well be that the government still decides that it is going to keep its bat and ball at home and it is not going to go anywhere with the treaty system and the UN.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>17128</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That the committee system of the United Nations is flawed is not disputed; that it can be improved is not disputed.

What the United Nations try to do is to substitute a different method by which nations can relate to each other. In other words, instead of using the method of war, they try to use the method of committees or organisations. They have committees where people can put their complaints; they have organisations where the world can come together and try to work out basic and fundamental rights and obligations that people have which might guide the world so we do not have the disasters of the 20th century.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australia has played a very honourable part in the United Nations. Australia committed itself to the United Nations forces in Korea and lost lives there. More recently, Australia went with the United Nations to the Gulf War. But, at the same time, Australia has signed and ratified a number of treaties, and it is important that those treaties and those conventions be maintained by Australia and by nations as a whole. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, `We're going to have a system that does away with wars. We're going to have a legal system that will operate within a country so that matters are disposed of in a reasonable way.' You cannot have that approach and then say, `When something goes against us we're not going to pay attention.' The proposition is not that the United Nations committees are always right; they are not. The proposition is that that system the United Nations has set up should be maintained because the alternative is the grim alternative that we have spoken about already.  </para><para>It is clear that the system we live under, the common law system, can make mistakes. That is why we have courts—we have courts of first instance, appeal courts and the High Court—to try to overcome injustices that might otherwise occur. The mother of the common law system, England itself, can make mistakes. I was recently reading the cases of the Maguire Seven and the Birmingham Six that went for many years before they were properly resolved. So of course judicial bodies or bodies that make decisions can make mistakes. But because the alternative is so grim, we have to stick by it. We also have to build up a culture in the world where people will listen to decisions. The decisions themselves have to be sound—of course they have to be sound. But we should not simply—and this expression has been used—spit the dummy because we do not like a particular decision. </para><para>Senator Bourne went through the joint media release, and I think that is a fair way of doing it because that puts the government's propositions—and it put a series of propositions. She took up, with her usual eloquence, a number of matters. I want to talk about a couple that she mentioned. Paragraph (ii)(c) states: </para><quote><para>Australia will reject unwarranted requests from treaty committees to delay removal or unsuccessful asylum seekers from Australia;</para></quote><para>In other words, Australia will decide whether or not it is an unwarranted request and simply reject a committee's request to have a person stay in Australia for a little while or even perhaps a substantial period of time while they sort out the justices of the situation. Paragraph (ii)(b) states:</para><quote><para>Australia will only agree to visits to Australia by treaty committees and requests from the Committee on Human Rights `mechanisms' for visits and the provision of information where there is a compelling reason to do so;</para></quote><para>Senator Bourne made some good points about that. I say that that is not courteous language. That is not the sort of language that you would hope Australia would use. I think Australia is entitled to say, `We have some worries about the committee system. We would like, with other countries, to do something about it.' In fact that is what the press release has said. I think that is a very positive approach taken by the government in this media release, but it has used language elsewhere which is quite discourteous and quite insulting to the system. What do I draw from that? If we are going to get the changes in the system that we want, then we ought to do so with courtesy. </para><para>I was reading an article recently about the legal system in the United States. It was written by Louis Pollak, a senior judge of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He talked about various matters and he referred to Justice Kennedy and what he said. But the point he made is that if we are going to get anywhere and if we are going to get there in the way that we need to get there, in a way that is most effective, then we ought to do so with courtesy. If we as a nation are going to complain about the way the United Nations and its committees are being conducted, then we ought to approach that task with considerable courtesy. We should give them respect and we should see whether we can change them.</para><para>As Senator Bourne has pointed out, there is concern in Australia about the way illegal immigrants or asylum seekers are treated. That reflects the concern of this particular committee of the United Nations. In other words, the sorts of things that United Nations committees are saying are things that have got some resonance amongst certain sections, and quite large sections, of the Australian community. A question that has to be asked is: is it good to have asylum seekers, or illegal immigrants for that matter—depending on how you want to look at it and from which direction you come—locked up in a place like Woomera? It is very similar to the sorts of places that have been established over the years—for example, in South Africa by the British during the Boer War. I am not saying that, for one minute, the camps that the British set up for the Boers are the same as the camps set up in Woomera, but they are set up in remote areas and in circumstances that concern people, including Australians.</para><para>The point I am making is this: the sorts of complaints against conventions that the committees are dealing with are the sorts of complaints that many Australians find of concern. Therefore, it is not as if these committees are dealing with matters that do not concern some Australians—and a substantial number of Australians—and do not concern Australians in a very substantial way. It is not as if these are bizarre sorts of things that the committees are doing; they are not bizarre at all. These concerns are very much in the mainstream of the concerns that decent people have. I am not saying that, unless you have these concerns, you are not a decent person. I am saying that decent people have concerns and decent people may not have concerns. But the point I am making is that decent people do. The sorts of things that the United Nations is talking about are the sorts of things that concern people in this country—like mandatory sentencing, the treatment of the indigenous population and the treatment of people claiming to be asylum seekers. These sorts of things are substantial matters. </para><para>In the world there is a frightful amount of injustice—there is no doubt about that. There is more injustice overseas than there is here, but nevertheless—as Senator Coonan pointed out in her discussion yesterday on the World Trade Organisation—as it is a world now that acts more and more as an unified whole, it is important that everywhere in the world rights are properly vindicated. It does not really serve us well to simply say, `True enough, we may have infringed in a marginal way on human rights, but look at how human rights have been denied around the world.' That does not solve the problem. If there is an injustice, then that injustice should be remedied. If it can be remedied through the United Nations, well and good.</para><para>What tends to happen is that we start thinking in numbers; we start thinking in masses. Huge numbers of people were killed through bombing during the Second World War. And since the Second World War, there have been other wars—for example, the Vietnam War. You can think of those killed as numbers, or you can think of them as people who may have left home to go shopping one day and never returned because they were killed. You can think of a child running into the street and being killed or of a young boy running into the street and having his leg blown off. You can think of a mother going into a field in one of the war-torn sections of Africa and having her leg blown off. To say to her, `You are just one—there are lots more people killed and injured elsewhere,' does not really service her.</para><para>In the same way, if there are indigenous people in Australia who suffer—and the evidence is there are—if they are locked up under mandatory sentencing, and if people who claim to be asylum seekers are treated in a particular way, then we as a decent society have to look at what relief we can give them. Of course we have to hear the case and make sure we have all the facts, but once we have established the facts, and if they indicate that an injustice has been done, we have to try cure it. Since we are a part of the world—whether through trade or in any other way—then we as decent international citizens should play our part in that world. We cannot say that in the fields of commerce and economics we will be a part of the world, but in matters of rights, matters of the human heart and the human soul, matters of principle, and matters that go to our identity as social beings we will just ignore the world. We cannot say that we will choose only the part of the world that may return us income. That is not the way that a decent and enlightened country, such as Australia, should look at things.</para><para>I want to make this clear. When my forebears came here in the 19th century, Australia had a long way to go—although, I must confess, there were great attractions in that period. Things have advanced considerably since then. Australia is one of the great nations of the world and, in my view, it is the great nation of the world. But nobody is perfect and, if there are ways that we can improve through international bodies, then we ought to take them. While wanting to reform and improve these international bodies, these international committees, we should never create a situation whereby their force is diminished and perhaps rendered nugatory, thus affording the risk that the terrible things that happened in the middle of the 20th century might come again. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>17132</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This morning when I arrived at the Senate, I was met by Mr Harry Adams of Canberra Legacy and I bought one of the Legacy badges.

Is good.' The Labor Party and Democrats seem to adopt the same approach: `Is treaty. Is good.' As soon as they have a treaty in front of them, they accept it as being good without adopting any rigour and without any examination of whether or not the treaty might be of benefit to this nation or, indeed, of whether the committee system, under that particular treaty, is in need of reform.</para><para>All that we as the Liberal Party and the National Party are saying is that there is a need for reform and a need for some examination. We do not believe that Australian policies ought to be dictated by overseas bodies. In support of that proposition I quote that great Labor luminary who exposed the fraud of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the goods and services tax—none other than John Della Bosca, who was quoted on 15 December 1999 as saying that an international agency should not be dictating Australian policies. I say to John Della Bosca: on this, as with the GST, I happen to agree with you. I hope there are more occasions when I am able to do so.</para><para>But we on this side are not into UN sycophancy.

That convention has a committee established under it; and we have such luminaries on the committee as representatives from Cuba and China. These representatives, whilst they are elected, have to be nominated by their home state or country. So the fellow who was appointed who was Cuban needed the blessing of Fidel Castro. What were his qualifications for this position in which to hector and lecture other countries on human rights?

I turn to China. I wonder whether the Chinese representative on this committee on racial discrimination somehow got their ticket on the basis of their commitment to human rights in Tiananmen Square or because they happen to believe in the rights of the Tibetan people. I somehow think that, if that had been their background, they would not have got the blessing of the communist Chinese government to be nominated for this position. These are the types of `experts' to whom Senator Cook referred in his speech as the experts sitting on these international committees. Why Senator Cook would be such an apologist for them beggars belief, and I wonder why he does it—because it is clearly not within our nation's interests.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But let us have a look at some of the determinations that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has made. First of all, I indicate that this committee, if you like, sets out ticks and crosses in relation to countries and classifies its reports into positive aspects and subjects of concern. So positive aspects get ticks and subjects of concern get crosses. It would be interesting for the Australian people to know that, in the recent report, this so-called independent committee found its way clear to give two positives and 13 concerns to Australia—a pretty bad record.</para><para>But you can make a comparison. The committee had a look at China, and what did it find? Surprisingly, six positives—more than for Australia—and only 10 concerns: three times as many positives or ticks for China as it could find for Australia. Russia scored six positives as well and only four concerns. And guess what Cuba scored? One concern and four positives. So, if you were to decide which country you wanted to live in on the basis of the determination of this expert committee—as Senator Cook and Senator Bourne would have us believe—on human rights in the various countries, you should be moving to Cuba.

Why is it that Susie Maroney seems to be the only one swimming the channel in the wrong direction, to Cuba? Everybody else from Cuba seems to be wanting to swim in the other direction, out of Cuba. Yet, according to this committee, Cuba scores the best. Why is it that, if Australia gets such a bad and damning record card from this United Nations committee, all these illegal immigrants and refugee boats seem to want to find their way to Australia? Why aren't these people told about the wonderful human rights that exist in China and Cuba, as this committee has found out? It seems to me that even the illegal immigrants and refugees, who do not have access to all the information, know better than the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. You really have to ask yourself what these committees are on about. I think that is a good example, highlighting the need for reform.</para></talk.start></continue><para> This same committee made a finding in relation to native title. One of the committee members referred to the judge in the Miriuwung-Gajerrong case and quoted that judgment with authority for their particular determination, saying that the Australian courts supported their particular position. That was whilst the decision was still under appeal to the full Federal Court which, of course, overturned the court at first instance. But do we have this representative of the United Nations saying, `Oops, I got it wrong,' or `We now need to reconsider our approach to Australia over native title'? No, they will keep on wallowing in their own ignorance, not interested in the facts. They will just keep wallowing in their ignorance, hoping that nobody will notice. But the fact is that there are some of us in Australia who do take notice of the UN committee reports and then analyse them against a rigorous test: are they sustainable? The clear situation is that they are not.</para><para>This same committee seems to have great delight in wallowing in ignorance. There were members of this CERD committee—and I think most Australians would find this quite offensive—who seriously inquired whether the Ku Klux Klan had been invited to Australia and whether apartheid was operating as official government policy—and they were asking these questions quite seriously just in recent times. How embarrassingly out of touch. But I suppose that is one of the endearing things about the United Nations which attracts Senator Cook to it—because to be embarrassingly out of touch seems to be something that Senator Cook can identify with. But the only person who seems to have made those suggestions is, in fact, the person who is now being purged from Labor's own front bench.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Mr Melham, Senator Ludwig.

I happen to believe that ratification of international and regional conventions or treaties by Australia can result in a contraction of national sovereignty and a democratic deficit. That is because `commitment to an international obligation can effectively restrict our options to pursue a different course'. Guess who made that outrageous comment? None other than Sir Anthony Mason, the former Chief Justice of the High Court. I must say he is not necessarily one of my favourites. But if even he can bring himself to make comments of that nature, why is it that the Labor Party so steadfastly refuse to see the light in relation to these important issues? The reason is: they are sycophants of the United Nations.</para><para>I now seek to turn to the excellent article that appeared in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> by the honourable member for Wentworth, Mr Andrew Thomson. He is the highly regarded and respected chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. He brings to that position a rare combination in politics—that of intellectual rigour and commonsense. I do not agree with all that he wrote, but I think that the issues he canvassed are worthy of consideration. But, of course, Senator Cook simply dismisses Mr Thomson as bizarre. So let us have a look at some of these allegedly bizarre quotes. Mr Thomson tells us: </para><quote><para>Treaties are a necessary part of government. They serve to regulate relations between nations, and—hopefully—to advance some agreed-upon goals among many nations. They can be valuable if well drafted and sensibly implemented.</para></quote><para>I would have thought that good commonsense stuff—but, according to Senator Cook, it is completely dismissed as bizarre. Then we have Mr Thomson saying:</para><quote><para>It's time the burden of proof was placed squarely on the Geneva bureaucracy to justify its methods and spell out its results.</para></quote><para>What is the matter with asking the United Nations bureaucracy in Geneva to justify its methodology and spell out its results? I would have thought anybody would have embraced that sort of approach to the United Nations—and if the United Nations had nothing to hide, that organisation itself would be embracing that approach. But, no, it is dismissed by the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in this place as bizarre. Mr Thomson goes on:</para><quote><para>The commission and its committees are behaving in a political fashion.</para></quote><para>I have to say that, from the evidence just from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, it is clear that that occurs—and, if they are not behaving in such a fashion, let Senator Cook come in here and explain why he thinks they are not. But I think most people are agreed that they are behaving in that way. Mr Thomson says:</para><quote><para>Treaties must not be misused as a surreptitious backdoor way into the domestic legal jurisdiction of sovereign states, especially gold-plated democracies such as Australia.</para><para>Nor should human rights governance be a stalking horse for minority fundamentalism.</para></quote><para>I have to say that sounds like good commonsense to me—nothing bizarre about that. But, of course, the good Senator Cook would have us believe that all of what Mr Thomson has said is bizarre. I have to say that it sounds like good commonsense to me.</para><para>Not once were we told by Labor that they would seek to reform the United Nations if they were to win government. There was not one mention of the need for reform. According to Labor, all is rosy at the UN. Well, on this side of politics we happen to disagree, and I have to say that our fellow Australians are very strongly behind us in relation to this. But the most bizarre thing is that a former government leader for the Australian Labor Party in this place, one to whom we on this side endearingly refer as Gareth Gareth, former senator Gareth Evans, wrote a book about international matters—and guess what outrageous material he printed in the book at chapter 11? Chapter 11 is about `reforming the United Nations'. Even Gareth Gareth is talking about reforming the United Nations, but Senator Cook will hear none of it and Senator Bourne will hear none of it. Senator Cooney wanted to hear just a little bit about it. He told us that it might need reform but that he was not going to push for reform. But if even former senator Gareth Evans can bring himself to an acknowledgment that there is the need for reform in the United Nations, why do Senator Cook and the Labor Party in this place completely deny the need for reform? Indeed, the speeches of Senators Cook, Bourne and Cooney reminded me of the three monkeys—they `see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil' about the United Nations because everything is fine. The simple fact is that it is not. Even former senator Gareth Evans acknowledges the need for reform.</para><para>It is not every day that the government can pull out an editorial from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, but today even they were moved to write. The article states:</para><quote><para>The Government stands accused of jeopardising the cause of global human rights. Rather, it should be applauded for having the guts, as a voice of democracy, to stand up and fight a UN system that has made the examination of human rights abuses bureaucratic, misguided and irrelevant.</para></quote><para>We on this side of politics say amen to that. That is what we are trying to achieve. We happen to believe in the noble cause of the United Nations and the human rights treaties, but we do not believe in the bureaucratic and political fashion in which some of its committees are going about their alleged tasks. Might I add that Senator Bourne somehow tried to argue that the need for reform was discovered only this year—I think the date she quoted was 30 March. I still recall Senator Hill coming into this place on 2 May 1996, shortly after our election, indicating the need for reform to the treaty making process through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—something that we established against the wishes of the Australian Labor Party. </para><para>Let us go through Australian action on treaty body reform. Together with Canada, New Zealand and Norway, Australia has made statements over a number of years on treaty body reform and the effective implementation of the human rights treaty system. In December 1997, the Attorney-General spoke on the matter. In January 1998, Australia provided substantial written comments to the UN's report on the long-term effectiveness of the treaty bodies. In mid-1998, Australia, Canada and New Zealand submitted a joint paper to the human rights committee containing suggestions for reform of some of the committee's rules of procedure. I say to Senator Bourne that these things did not occur on 30 March this year. They have been part of the government's agenda since we were elected. Indeed, in May 1999, the Australian ambassador in Geneva called on Mrs Robinson and delivered to her a letter outlining the government's concerns with the operation of treaty bodies. Of course, Senator Cooney said that the sort of language we were using was `discourteous'. What was Mrs Robinson's response? She expressed herself to be `entirely comfortable' with Australia's approach. So the only discomfort seems to be with Senator Cooney and the Labor Party, because for some unknown reason they will not countenance any criticism of the United Nations.</para><para>I say to you that only the most wilfully ignorant could assert that the United Nations was not in need of reform. We as a government see the need for reform, along with a growing number of other countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Norway. We will work with them to ensure reform of the United Nations for the betterment of the purposes for which that lofty body was established.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>17135</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The press release of Tuesday, 29 August 2000 put out by the Hon. Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was a joint media release by Mr Downer, Mr Williams and Mr Ruddock. It starts with lofty goals. It is called `Improving the Effectiveness of United Nations Committees'. What is the catch? Australia will cut off its nose to spite its face—that is the catch. The press release states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Cabinet decided Australia's strategic engagement with the treaty committee system should be dependent on the extent to which effective reform occurs.</para></quote><para>There is the catch. They are saying, `We are not going to do anything until we get our own way.' So what would you expect? You could perhaps expect a helping hand to bolster the effectiveness of the UN and its various committees, perhaps assistance in money terms and specialist skills, perhaps sponsorship of committee work and perhaps greater involvement to demonstrate our bona fides and our true international leadership. But after you read what the government intend to do you see a very different picture.</para><para>The joint press release of Mr Downer and Mr Williams talks about implementing measures to improve Australia's `continued interaction with UN human rights treaty committees'. The real focus is much narrower. Turning to what the joint media release proposes to offer, we see on the second page—not on the front page—that the catch will be the measure recommending:</para><quote><para>(a) reporting to and representation at treaty committees be based on a more economical and selective approach where appropriate ...</para></quote><para>and it goes on in the same vein. It is not about helping, it is not about assisting and it is not about providing leadership in an international forum. Towards the end of the joint press release, the following jumps out at you:</para><quote><para>In addition the Government will: </para><para>(a) undertake a comprehensive review of Australia's and other parties' interpretation and implementation of the 1951 Refugees Convention and consider the need for remedial legislation;</para></quote><para>It goes to the interpretation and implementation of the convention, so it is also a slight attack on the High Court. It does not like what the High Court says about how it interprets our conventions and the treaties we sign, and it considers remedial action to direct it the way it wants. A very narrow-minded government has taken this stand. Buried in the press release, we find the true motive:</para><quote><para>... Australia gets a better deal from the UN treaty committees.</para></quote><para>That is what it is after: a better deal. It does not like the cut it got. These are real bullyboy tactics. If there is something the government does not like, rather than critically examine it, Mr Downer has decided to take his bat and ball and go home. I have heard that reflected around the chamber a number of times this evening. It is saying: `If I don't get a fair deal, I'm not going to cop any constructive criticism, and I'm not going to attempt to address the underlying issues. I'm just going to take a very narrow view and look inwardly.' Where did this come from? It came from a bit of criticism from a UN committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, or CERD. It goes to the media release of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, of 30 March 2000, where he responded to the criticism in the following way:</para><quote><para>The Committee's response was disappointing in the extreme.</para></quote><para>But that was not enough. There will always be criticism but, rather than defend his policies and rather than defend his government in an international forum, we have a response which can only be categorised as `I will do it my way now.' We have the statement:</para><quote><para>The Cabinet has determined that it would now be appropriate to review how Australia participates in the UN treaty committee system.</para></quote><para>Mr Downer has hidden behind cabinet, so we find that this is what cabinet wants—perhaps not even Mr Downer wants it. This is a real 1950s government: inwardly looking and wanting to play an international role but not willing to accept the burden which may come with such responsibility. To reject ratifying the protocol relating to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women is a truly backward step. Next, Mr Downer will be joining Mr Vince Lester, a well-known person in Queensland, for the prize of walking backwards. What a weak excuse.</para><para>The protocol would allow access to a complaints mechanism under that convention. Mr Downer believes there is an excellent system within Australia for any human rights complaints by women to be addressed. If it is so excellent, what would it truly matter if there were an international forum where a person could complain? This is real straw man reasoning, as hollow and as empty as Mr Daryl Williams's arguments must have been when urging Mr Downer not to go down this path at all. The federal Attorney should be uncomfortable. His standing is taking a knocking. He has not led on issues of mandatory sentencing, he has not led on defending the High Court, he has not led on issues of native title and he has not led on the treatment of asylum seekers in respect of a legal basis. Mr Williams has let the Australian people down. The office of the Attorney-General is a poorer place. How has Mr Downer been treated overseas? An overseas press release on Mr Downer and his review of UN committees entitled `Angry Oz to restrict UN access'—this is the world looking at us—states:</para><quote><para>Canberra, Australia—Stung by criticism over its treatment of Aborigines and other issues, the Australian government said on Tuesday that it will restrict visits by UN human rights inspectors and urged an overhaul of the UN's committee system.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say:</para><quote><para>Earlier this year, the UN Human Rights Committee found that mandatory sentencing laws in two Australian jurisdictions discriminated against Aborigines, and criticised the government for failing to overrule them.</para></quote><para>Lastly, it states:</para><quote><para>UN committees also criticised the government's policy of holding illegal immigrants in detention camps while their refugee applications are determined, and for allowing uranium mining in a World Heritage listed park.</para></quote><para>It goes on to provide criticism—robust criticism; it appears robust criticism is something Mr Downer cannot take. I think he has missed the point. I would not have thought that he and the Attorney-General would have fallen for this. Does the advanced student in university or the schoolchild in grade 1 or grade 2 in primary school or in secondary school reject constructive criticism outright and compare themselves to the worst performer in the class? Do they sit back in their chair and say, `I am all right, Jack. I can read, I do not need to try anymore. I do not need to strive, to push or excel.' The Attorney-General and Mr Downer have set a very low benchmark for themselves in representing the Australian people. Instead of saying, `We will take the constructive criticism; we will accept the constructive criticism; we understand that, on the international stage, we have been and believe ourselves to be world leaders in human rights,' they pick up their bat and their ball and say, `We will go home, we are that unhappy. We understand our obligations but do not believe we have to fulfil it. </para><para>Even a Liberal ex-Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, opposes this government's stand and its record on human rights. I will read from <inline font-style="italic">Unity</inline>, the national magazine of the United Nations Association of Australia, what Mr Fraser said on the United Nations:</para><quote><para>We have supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have ratified the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</para><para>Did we mean it when we took these steps? Or were we trying to say “we ratified these instruments so that we can apply them to the rest of the world but they do not apply to Australia”?</para></quote><para>That is the Liberal ex-Prime Minister's view. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Treaties and was appalled at the off-the-planet comments by the Liberal backbencher Mr Andrew Thomson, chair of that committee. As chair of a committee that is currently looking into the Kyoto protocol and the World Trade Organisation, Mr Thomson has put his personal views before the work of the committee, and I think it quite possibly harmed the standing of the good work the committee does. It is going to be a very difficult task to restore the credibility of the committee, given Mr Thomson's stance. Already it has suffered from a lacklustre image. Mr Thomson has now given himself a vote of no-confidence. Rather than be critical, strident and supportive of the work of the treaties committee, rather than push it forward to where it should be to convince not only the government but the people of Australia that it plays a very important and integral role, we find that his contribution is simply one of jumping onto the bandwagon and being one of the knockers. Mr Thomson has a responsibility to ensure that the work of the treaties committee is not cheapened. Mr Thomson has a position and should at least try to be objective in his role rather than adopt a partisan view.</para><para>He need look no further than at the sugar industry and the way the government has set up a task force that we understand might find a report to release tomorrow.

The committee's report and comments on Australia's performance have now been released. By and large, it is a good report but it does offer some constructive criticism in respect of some human rights issues. </para><para>I will give a little background because it is worth understanding that the human rights committee is not a committee that came from nowhere. The ICCPR was adopted by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force in 1976 and Australia—yes, us—ratified the covenant in 1980 and it became applicable in that year. The ICCPR established the human rights committee. It is made up of experts who are nominated by the countries that are parties to the ICCPR. Article 28 stipulates that the committee will consist of 18 members, and the members are elected by secret ballot. </para><para>The Australian government is obliged to put reports to the committee under article 40. But not only that; it is this procedure that the committee has reported on Australia's compliance with certain articles under the ICCPR which has raised concerns. The first optional protocol to the ICCPR entered into force generally in 1976 and was ratified and came into force in Australia on 25 December 1991. The protocol has the effect that a state becomes a party to the protocol and recognises the competence of the committee to receive and consider communications from individuals subject to its jurisdiction. Of course, the findings of the committee are not legally enforceable but do have significant international and domestic persuasive effect.</para><para>Back to article 40 where it started, under this Australia is required to submit a report to the committee. We have submitted our third and fourth reports on the measures adopted to give effect to the rights recognised in the treaty. It was delivered by Mr Leslie Luck and in it the government presented a comprehensive account of the legislation. The human rights committee released a press release on 20-21 July 2000. The concluding observations of the human rights committee—in fact, the main area of criticism—surrounded the mandatory sentencing laws of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, the effects on indigenous Australians of the wealth disparity, the stolen generation, and Australia's treatment of boat arrivals and refugee applicants. To quote one example of what the committee said in relation to mandatory imprisonment in WA and Northern Territory:</para><quote><para>The committee noted that this led in many cases to punishment disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime committed, and seemed inconsistent with strategies that have been introduced to reduce the over-representation of indigenous Australians in the criminal justice system.</para></quote><para>The recommendation of the committee stated:</para><quote><para>The State party is urged to reassess the legislation regarding mandatory imprisonment so as to ensure that all covenant rights to be respected. </para></quote><para>It is not a burden that any government would find impossible to live with or impossible to strive to fix. The government's response has been to reject much of the concluding observations. It is not a matter of picking up and shooting the messenger.

That is manifestly not the case as the government has made it clear that it is not walking away from the system. Its actions are motivated simply to bring about reform. There cannot be any serious argument that the treaty committee system is not in need of reform. This has been widely recognised by other member countries from time to time.  </para></talk.start><para>The procedural problems and the composition of the human rights committees are systemically flawed. The procedures of the committees do not presently meet the standards and judicial process of independence required by a small claims tribunal in Australia, let alone bodies whose views can have an impact upon our constitutional arrangements and our domestic law. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that the United Nations committees come anywhere near the standards we require in our own country of review and rigour in judicial decisions. The lack of transparency and accountability, the closed hearings, the failure to have regard to pertinent evidence, the failure to test any of the evidence and occasionally it would seem actual—or certainly perceived—bias all amount to a seriously flawed system, and one that we simply would not tolerate if we were looking at it in this country. How many committees do we have in the Senate to ensure the most rigorous processes of fairness? Senator Ludwig serves with me on at least one of them where we look every week that parliament sits on whether or not there is an appeal system, whether it is fair and whether people can actually be heard. </para><para>It is a curious paradox, and one that I do not think has been pointed out by any previous speaker although it has been a long debate and I may have missed it, that in these days of quite legitimate public demand for greater participation in our parliamentary democracy and for greater accountability of publicly elected representatives—I wholeheartedly endorse these—there are those in our midst who at the same time are clamouring to air their grievances in an undemocratic committee system. It is a curious paradox because what we are doing is airing our grievances, or at least some of our citizens seem to wish to do this, in a system ill-suited—at least the way it presently runs—for its purpose and ill-suited to taking a role in a sophisticated legal system that most developed democracies enjoy and certainly that we all aspire to. </para><para>The shortcomings of the committee system then should frankly be conceded instead of our beating around the bush about it. There really ought not to be any argument that the committee system, the way it is presently constituted, is seriously flawed. I am very surprised that has not been frankly conceded by anyone on the other side, apart from Senator Cooney. I think Senator Ludwig may have been getting around to it as his concluding point, but then he was shut out by time.</para><para>Let us assume that there are a couple of people from the opposition who would frankly concede that this committee system is flawed. The issue is: what do you do about it? We should really get on with restoring the integrity of the system. This would certainly be the most effective way to further the monitoring of human rights, would it not? As it stands it is in danger, I think, of driving complying countries, such as Australia, out of the process altogether, which is not desirable. Australia is not the only country to have community concerns about the breakdown of the committee system. When the government announced that it was undertaking a review, it was suggested in an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">National Post</inline>—which I think is based in Toronto—that Australia may be starting a trend. That editorial said in part:</para><quote><para>It is objectionable that a country like Canada should be lectured on human rights by UN committees whose members are drawn in part from states where female mutilation—</para></quote><para>presumably that means female genital mutilation—</para><quote><para>censorship and arbitrary imprisonment are widely practised.</para><para>Even if UN committees were Simon Pure, that would not legitimise their intrusions. If nations can be required, even in theory, to change their domestic policies by external bodies then they have ceased to be either self-governing or democratic. It merely adds insult to injury when the UN perverts the notion of human rights to justify such interventions. </para><para>Australia is right to question its membership of the UN treaty system—Canada should follow suit.</para></quote><para>Of course we have never questioned our membership of the United Nations treaty system, so the editorial is quite incorrect in that respect. But the sentiment, I think, comes very close to mirroring the concerns that have been widely expressed by the community and given action to by the government in suggesting that we should pull back from participation in the committee system until we can get it reformed.</para><para>Lest anyone listening to this debate thinks that Australia is standing alone in its concerns, in mid-1998 Australia, Canada and New Zealand formally submitted a joint paper to the Human Rights Committee looking at five areas of reform in which to improve the committee's rules of procedure. I am surprised it was only five areas of reform. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and, most recently, Norway have made statements relating to treaty body reform to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. In early 1999 the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson—a celebrity politician if ever there was one—commissioned a major report on treaty commission reform, and Australia is actively participating in this process. So it is not as if Australia is standing alone in voicing its concerns.</para><para>I do not really think there is much room to cavil with the proposition that Australia does have a proud record on human rights. We have a sophisticated legal system to both define and protect our rights and freedoms, be they political, personal, religious or civic. The extent to which the United Nations committee system has lost the plot can be seen in the recent report under the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination—it has been mentioned this afternoon—where Australia compares unfavourably to the performance of China, Russia and Pakistan, which is of course under a military dictatorship. Australia, as a substantially complying nation, is a soft target for committees that have simply failed to come to grips with the gross violations, the almost unspeakable violations, of human rights in Rwanda, Kosovo, Srebrenica and, perhaps more pointedly, certainly in respect of Australia, East Timor—that is, before the government, with, I must say, multi-party support and the overwhelming support of the Australian people, had the decency and the moral and physical courage to commit our troops to help a defenceless people.</para><para>Is it any wonder that the Australian community is asking what is going on with these committees? Just as compellingly the Australian people are entitled to ask whether the Labor Party is happier attacking Australia than defending it. Certainly we get that impression this afternoon. Is it really suggested by those in opposition that we should invite to Australia the United States special rapporteur on torture? What is the special rapporteur going to find here? We need a reality check. Surely the Labor Party is not unaware that treaty body reform is long overdue. In 1999, 1,146 reports were overdue under the six human rights treaties and in 1999 it was estimated that 2,500 pieces of correspondence to the Human Rights Committee were awaiting reply. Interestingly enough, in relation to the United Nations, a Labor man who has some previous form in covering Labor hypocrisy—and I refer to Mr Della Bosca—said:</para><quote><para>An international agency should not be dictating Australian policies.</para></quote><para>Mr Della Bosca's observations, as with his observations about Labor's nonsensical position on the roll-back of the GST, are spot-on. There is no doubt that we desperately need nuts and bolts reform of the United Nations committees. The government's position is entirely justified and, I suspect, long overdue. I have not had a chance to talk about CEDAW, but that is another misconception that Senator Cook's motion perpetrates.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>17140</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties</title><page.no>17140</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>17140</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></motion><para>This document follows on quite appropriately from the debate we have just been having. It is a positive move that regularly tabled in both houses is a list of all the different multilateral treaty actions presently—or expected to be within 12 months—under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government. It is particularly important in light of the government's actions in the last couple of days to wonder whether it is worth all the bother. There is a huge number of different treaties happening here, and at the same time we have got the federal government walking away from its obligations internationally, vilifying the United Nations, vilifying the whole concept of working internationally with other organisations uness they agree with what we are doing. You have to wonder what the point of all of this work is. </para><para>Of course, a lot of these treaties are for areas much broader than just the United Nations, but there is work being done that is listed here. Negotiations are under way for amendments to or supplements to existing treaties under the human rights section of the United Nations. This is part of the international treaties where the government is now saying, `We won't invite them in here. We won't let them in here, unless they have got a really good reason,' yet we have got public servants working at taxpayers' expense currently negotiating for amendments and supplement to existing treaties on the convention against torture, and the convention against the prohibition of development, prohibition and stockpiling of biological weapons and the destruction of those weapons. These are very important areas where, unfortunately, now the impetus of Australia in working with these areas with other nations around the world is being dramatically undermined by the actions of the federal government. This is all as a result of a couple of reports from a committee somewhere criticising us. There is no requirement, no onus on us to do anything, no compromise of our sovereignty.</para><para>Another area that is listed in this document as having activities happening is the World Trade Organisation. There is a whole range of agreements in terms of ongoing negotiations with the WTO—agreements on government procurement, on trade related aspects of international property rights, on agreement on rules of origin, and on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade amendments. The WTO is an area where we have a recent example where an unelected, non-accountable international body—controlled not by NGOs on a guilt trip but by huge companies, by multinational corporations, by large nations and their trading interest—made a ruling. They made a finding, and they forced Australia to act. They forced Australia to change. They forced Australia to take a greater risk in terms of importing diseased animal products, fish products, into our nation.</para><para>That is a case where Australia was impacted by an international, unelected, non-accountable body. Do we see the federal government saying, `We'll step back from the WTO because it is imposing on our sovereignty'—not to mention putting our environment, particularly the environment of Tasmania, at risk? No action there. It is full steam ahead. Yet when we get a little report from a committee saying that we are contravening some human rights or not meeting our obligations suddenly we are putting up the brick walls, not letting anybody in to the country, refusing to work with them, and saying that the whole process is flawed. Where are the statements from the government saying the WTO is flawed when it is forcing us to take higher risks in terms of taking imports of diseased salmon, just to use one example. And there are other examples in terms of putting ourselves up for greater environmental risk. There are no words from the government in relation to that. And, as this document shows, there is ongoing work happening to continue to expand our involvement in the WTO.</para><para>I am not necessarily someone who says we should remove ourselves from the WTO, but if we are looking at reforming a process how about looking at reforming the WTO, so that it more appropriately takes into account our national interest, our national need—whether you are talking about environment, economy or social standards? There are no words from the government on that. The only area of concern is human rights. That is where we want to back away—the rights of women, the rights of refugees. How is the government's action impacting on all the work that is represented in this document—the work of so many public servants, whom I am sure are working with the best of intentions—in this list of treaties, many of which are in the UN human rights area: conventions on the rights of the child, optional protocols on children in armed conflict. Our efforts in trying to get positive change in really important areas are clearly being undermined by the government's actions in so many of the areas that are contained in this document. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>17142</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier this afternoon we spoke about the UN convention and the position of the government in relation to treaties, and tonight we are considering a list of multilateral treaty action presently under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government. But in an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> under the headline `Senate must rescue treaties from abuse' we find the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Mr Andrew Thomson, taking what could only be described as a cheap shot at not only the treaties committee but also, I suspect, the treaty system we adopt in Australia. He promotes that:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We ought to consider amending the Constitution to make a two-thirds majority vote of the Senate a condition to any future government ratifying a treaty.</para></quote><para>As lofty as that position might be, I do not know whether Mr Thomson has consulted Mr Downer about it or whether it is a position he has come up with. He certainly has not, as I understand it, taken it to the treaties committee for consideration or looked at reviewing the treaty committee process itself. </para><para>The treaty making process has been subject to a review; it was revamped in 1996. A government document about the treaties committee and its role was produced in 1999. It was a document that tried to present a bright future for the treaty committee. Instead, we now have the chair of the committee lapsing into what could only be described as unusual abuse of the treaty making process. As far as the criticism is concerned, I quote from the article:</para><quote><para>They allow no cross-examination of NGO evidence by accused states, instead favouring an inquisitorial approach wherein the committee members ...</para></quote><para>I leave the quote at that point, because I want to focus on the word `inquisitorial'. Later on in the article, the chair of the committee, Mr Andrew Thomson, contrasts that inquisitorial system with the International Court of Justice in The Hague. When we look at the Court of Justice in The Hague, we find that it does not use a common law system. It uses an inquisitorial system, as I understand it. It might be an amalgam, but the European system is a civil system, not a common law system. It might draw parts of the common law and parts of the civil system into an amalgam process. But it is quite unusual in this case to find Mr Thomson complaining about an inquisitorial process and then promoting it because it is on another plane. I suspect Mr Thomson needs to read a little bit wider. </para><para>Mr Thomson goes on in the article to talk about rights. He says:</para><quote><para>Instead of rights, why not be clearer and propose obligations that nations must sign up to?</para></quote><para>He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>It's the lack of clarity about human rights that frustrates so many people. Our common law is pretty clear.</para></quote><para>That is another extraordinary claim: `our common law is pretty clear'. I would be surprised to find that. The greatest part of our common law is that it is a system that is built upon decisions and precedent. It is not clear at all; it is not as clear as Mr Andrew Thomson thinks it is. Certainly it works, but it does not work because it is clear, as Mr Thomson says in his article. In the last part of his article, Mr Thomson says that he seeks change along the lines that he has adopted. I wait for him to put that change to the treaties committee, to promote it and to get Mr Downer's approval.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>17142</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on the same matter.

Senator Kemp built his career on bringing United Nations treaties to account.

Now we have an accountability system. The government now simply wish to extend the accountability and the workability of the United Nations treaty system. And why shouldn't we? We rate very highly in the democratic states. As the chairman of the treaties committee said, we are a gold-plated democracy. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I make that point because it was a former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who said:</para><quote><para>There is an obvious connection between democratic practices such as the rule of law and transparency and decision making and the achievement of true peace and security in a new and stable political order.</para></quote><para>The charter for the United Nations is peace, security and human rights. The point that Boutros-Ghali was trying to make is that a democracy is the building stone for peace and security, which is the mission statement of the United Nations. Australia is a gilt-edged democracy. We have nothing to be ashamed of. All I have heard this afternoon is the opposition and the Democrats knocking Australia's sovereignty and its right to administer its own laws. All afternoon the opposition and the Democrats have attacked Australia as if they were strangers in their own country. We have a right to lay down laws, and we have nothing to be ashamed of in implementing our own domestic laws. Look at what we have. We have an equal, free democracy, unmatched in the world. We have checks and balances in our system. We have the Senate and the House of Representatives. We have a judicial system. We have both a state system and a federal system. My point is that we have, I believe, more checks and balances in our democracy than there are in any other country. This country has nothing to be ashamed of; it has everything to be proud of. </para><para>I think it is a disgrace when committees of the United Nations rate Australia as worse offenders in relation to racial discrimination than countries like Pakistan, China and Cuba. For heaven's sake, use some basic commonsense and a bit of pride. Of course, why would you have pride in your country? You are the mob who want to change the flag. Not only do you want to change the flag; you want us to acquiesce to countries like Cuba, China and Pakistan. How dare you rate us! You will never get into government on that.</para><para>To return to the point in the short time I have left, Senator McKiernan knows this only too well, because he speaks very highly of this country's laws in relation to refugees. I would like to see Senator McKiernan get up and speak about this country's treatment of refugees. We have nothing to be ashamed of in regard to human rights, yet you would have certain members of the human rights committee criticising this country. You are on a loser.

We were so stupid in that case that we actually provided to the applying countries—the countries that were seeking to have our quarantine measures lowered—not one but two draft reports, one of which contained recommendations that the quarantine measures that were currently in place ought to be removed.

What you ought to be doing is ensuring that A-G's and DFAT have the resources to actually get in the game because they do not have those things at the moment. That is where we ought to be focusing in terms of international trade agreements. You people whinge and whine about some UN committee picking on us with regard to some aspects of our human rights.

The report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Two treaties tabled on 6 June 2000</inline> was tabled by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties this week, the committee chaired by the fast becoming notorious Mr Andrew Thomson, whose remarks had some coverage earlier this week in relation to other issues. I disagree very much with those remarks, but the conduct of the chair in the way he does business through the committee is something that I do not criticise. Indeed, I thank him in relation to this report and specifically for his willingness to seek a common agreement so that a consensus report could be put down, and that is what has occurred.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The report deals with two treaties. I will not go through with tedious repetition the government's position in relation to treaties more broadly. Suffice to say, the committee as a whole and its role highlight the importance of engaging internationally and examining and hopefully increasing community awareness and understanding the great benefit we get from many of the international agreements that we reach. One of the treaties covered in this report is the proposed agreement with Spain on remunerated employment for dependants of personnel at diplomatic and consular missions. The committee did not have any problems with that. The other treaty, which I want to speak about at more length, is the proposed amendments to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species. </para><para>The committee supported the amendments, and I personally very strongly support them—one amendment in particular will uplist the dugong to the highest level of protection in this convention. I think that is an appropriate move and a welcome one. From my own personal experience as environment spokesperson for the Democrats, I have a lot to criticise the federal government for in relation to their environment performance but, broadly speaking, their performance in relation to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species has been reasonably positive. There were some areas the Democrats would have liked the government to have put forward for uplisting and they have not but, generally speaking, I think the federal government has a reasonably positive record. </para><para>However, this report does focus on some concerns about the information provided by the Department of the Environment and Heritage to the committee in the process of the committee's consideration of the convention. It does make some criticisms about the inadequacies of the information the department provided originally, and I think those criticisms are fair enough. If all the information that was eventually provided had been provided initially, I think there would have been a lot less concern and a lot less scope for misunderstanding, shall we say, about the value or otherwise of what the government had done in supporting the uplisting of a number of different species, including dugong, and increasing the protection available to some endangered species under this convention. </para><para>I have spoken previously about the World Trade Organisation and its role in trade somewhat critically. This is another convention that deals with trade—with trade of endangered species only, but it is a very important mechanism for regulating, controlling, overseeing and managing trade in wildlife and plant species that are under threat. For some of those people in the community who like to suggest that one of the best ways to preserve wildlife is to commercialise it, I think the very existence of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species highlights the dangers of commercialising trade in wildlife, because in many cases the reason why species are listed as endangered under this convention is the existence of trade and the commercial industry surrounding some of those species. So it is a very important convention.</para><para>I think it is worth noting the importance of this convention, particularly given all the commentary not just in this place but in the broader community about international treaties and conventions. This is one that Australia has engaged in very constructively and reasonably effectively and with a strong willingness to enhance environmental protection around the world. It shows the benefits of engaging constructively. We do not always win. We cop a lot of criticism from other governments about some of the things we propose, but for some reason copping criticism in this area has not led us to talk about withdrawing, and nor should it. Similarly, Australia is critical of other countries in terms of some of their proposals. There is often robust debate and a lot of fairly intensive lobbying at the various meetings that regularly take place to look at the various species and categories of species listed in the convention.</para><para>It is worth emphasising the recommendations. There are specific recommendations encouraging the department to provide information about proposed amendments to the convention much further in advance than it has done. I think that is appropriate and very important, and I hope the Minister for the Environment and Heritage takes that on board. There is another recommendation that deals with the impact of automatic entry into force provisions. That means that when the convention agrees to make a change it will automatically come into force after 90 days. That raises some issues about whether that will give adequate opportunity for scrutiny by the community. I think that is an issue appropriate for debate. I am personally very dubious about the need to extend periods of time for entry into force under this convention anyway, particularly if notification is given to the committee and to the Australian community about proposed changes much earlier, as is recommended elsewhere in the report. But I do not have a problem with it being examined. I certainly do not have a problem with the government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other relevant ministers identifying those international agreements to which Australia is party that allow amendments agreed at a conference of parties to automatically enter into force without having to go through some further process—which is the thrust of the other recommendation. </para><para>As part of the broader ongoing need to increase community awareness and understanding of how some of these treaties and conventions operate, I think getting the facts of their operation out into the community, out into the public arena, would be valuable. Indeed, just into our arena and raising the awareness of parliamentarians would be a start because I am sure most of us do not know which treaties and conventions have those provisions in them. I think that is a recommendation worth supporting, although my personal view, in relation to this specific convention, CITES, is that I do not support and would not support extending or removing the automatic entry into force. I think it is important for prompt action to increase protection for endangered species where it is identified as necessary. It is a recommendation that I support, and I think this convention—the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species—is a classic example of a positive international convention that Australia, thankfully, is continuing to engage in, rather than withdrawing from, criticising, ridiculing and misrepresenting. I hope that the government reconsiders its approach to some other UN international processes and similarly engages more constructively on those, using the approach that the environment department has done under this minister and, I believe, under previous ministers. It is a positive one that has helped not just the Australian environment and the biodiversity of our species but also endangered species around the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>17147</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was asked to keep this item on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>for another senator. I was very interested in Senator Bartlett's comments about the CITES, given I was involved in some work with the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. That work involved the commercialisation of native wildlife and the interaction that the committee had with regard to proposals to trade in certain species of Australian birds, in particular, but in some respects reptiles as well. Restrictions were imposed on that trade not only by the CITES but also by the states, although there were differences in regulations between the states. So it was not just a question of international trade that the CITES covers but also a question of interstate trade and the requirements of state laws with regard to that trading.</para></talk.start><para>We discovered in that inquiry that there appeared to be a connection between commercialisation of certain species and the maintenance of habitat. In fact, in many cases the endangered species problem was connected with the conversion of habitat from the native state to the farmland state—draining of swamps, deforestation and the like. On private land, there was no gain to be made and no living to be made without that sort of interaction. The preservation of the habitat of some of the endangered species would only occur—indeed, there are examples from the United States and the African continent of positive experiences in the preservation of endangered species—because of a commercialisation of the species through various means, be it hunting, game park facilities or the like.

This is a very important report. From the brief time I have had to peruse it, I think it is a very comprehensive report. The report makes the point that Japan is, and has been for some decades, Australia's major trading partner. Page 107 of the report details by value the main export commodities to Japan from Australia. There is a very extensive and impressive list of exports to Japan—meat and meat preparation, cereal grains, metalliferous ores, coal and fish. As an aside, I think it is a matter of regret that much of what we export to Japan is basic raw material and no greater value adding takes place in the Australian economy. I will say a little more about that later on. </para></talk.start><para>The report also highlights on page 108 the enormous increase in the number of visitors to Australia from Japan. Table 5.7 shows that the number of visitors from Japan rose from 34,000 in 1978 to 479,900 in 1990. I do not know what the latest figures are. I am sure there are later figures available. But that illustrates just how important the Japanese tourist industry is to the Australian economy. In fact, in 1990, they were the largest contributors in terms of visitor numbers. So the basic health of the Japanese economy is obviously very important to Australia.</para><para>Regrettably, the Japanese economy in recent times has not performed well. This is outlined in chapter 3. Page 33 illustrates the annual growth rates for Japan from 1991. In 1991 there was a growth rate of three per cent; in 1992, it was 0.4 per cent; in 1993, it was 0.5 per cent; in 1994, it was 0.7 per cent; in1995, it was 2.7 per cent; in 1996, it was 3.4 per cent; and in calendar year 1997 it was back down to 0.9 per cent. I would just make one point about the growth rate in 1997. This was when Japan increased their goods and services tax. They had introduced a VAT or a goods and services tax as part of an earlier measure known as a `stimulatory' package.</para><para>Japan has seen a succession of stimulatory packages: initially an introduction of a GST and then the increasing of that GST in 1997. So, if Japan is anything to go by, using GSTs or VAT taxes as stimulatory packages has resulted in little in terms of positive economic outcomes. It is disappointing—I have only had a cursory read of this report—that it does not refer to the dismal failure of the GST as part of those stimulatory packages in the Japanese economy. It does make reference to the collapse in public confidence that accompanied that 1997 stimulatory package, but I cannot see any reference to the impact of the GST.</para><para>One of the great problems in the Japanese economy was the property boom and the bubble economy that finally burst in 1990. As part of that, of course, the level of debt owed by Japanese financial institutions in 1980 had accounted for 56.8 per cent of gross domestic product, total economic and services production, but it had risen 10 years later in 1990 to 103.1 per cent of gross domestic product. In other words, the level of debt carried by Japanese financial institutions was in excess of the total value of the Japanese economy by 1990. The great problem with this was that it was secured, in large part, by land and property values in Japan. Of course, the increasing value of property in Japan—which at times ran at 20, 30, 40 or 50 per cent per annum—was, for many of the financial institutions, the underlying asset that represented security for much of the loans.</para><para>When that property value collapsed, a significant number of Japanese financial institutions struggled to survive. I say that they `struggled to survive' because the Japanese concept of bankruptcy is totally different from ours. The Japanese government pumped in billions and billions of yen—billions and billions of Australian dollars; I do not know what the exchange rate was then—to prop up Japanese financial institutions. I cannot think of one Japanese financial institution which was allowed to go broke, even though by any standard accounting measure many of them were bankrupt. That is one of the reasons the Japanese economy has failed to recover. It simply staggered along during the 1990s.</para><para>One other issue that I want to touch on is the demographic changes in Japan. This is pointed out as a great opportunity for Australia in terms of exports. Japan is an interesting country. I think it will be the first country in the OECD, the advanced economic world, where the population will actually start declining as a result of low birth rates. That is in fact occurring this year. As I say, it is the first country with a declining population. But what is happening at the same time is a rapid ageing of the population. The report points out the demographic changes that are occurring and the opportunities for the export of Australian services, particularly to the aged care market. One word of caution, however: the Japanese pension system is underwritten by an equal contribution tax from employers and employees. I think it is about 6½ per cent each, totalling 13 per cent. That is simply not sustainable, given Japan's ageing population. The figures I have seen are that it is estimated that, in Japan over the next 20 years, the tax of about 13 per cent that currently funds their pension system will have to double in order to support their rapidly ageing population at current pension benefit levels. I would submit to the Senate that that is unsustainable and that they will not be able to carry that level of taxation and provide current benefits. </para><para>In conclusion, as a Tasmanian senator, I want to point out that the Tasmanian apple industry has finally cracked the export market into Japan, after many years of trying. As a Tasmanian, it is great to see that we have finally had what I suppose you could refer to as the `ordination' of Tasmanian apples. They have finally got into the Japanese market after 10 to 15 years of trying. I hope that the Japanese appreciate—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Watson</name></talker><para>—It is good news.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—It is good news, Senator Watson—a Tasmanian colleague.

One should realise the reason for the committee first deciding to look into the issue of Japan. It arose out of a previous inquiry that the committee had conducted on APEC and the importance of APEC to Australia and to the region—and, of course, Japan is very vital for our export industries. When we set about the compilation of this report, we looked at every aspect of the Japanese economy that we could look at and at its social and political life. This was a very serious attempt by the committee to assess the importance of Japan to our future—to see where it would place us and the steps that we should take as a nation to foster closer relationships with Japan.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting that, arising out of the release of this report, there have been comments that we do not understand the Japanese fully even today and that they do not understand our attitudes on some issues as well. Really, this boils down simply to the fact that I do not believe we take enough time and put enough effort and skill into fostering and developing our relationship with the Japanese people in a broader sense—whether it be in a political sense, in an educational sense or with exchanges of students or whatever it might be.</para><para>This is the first part of the report, which simply looks at the Japanese economy. As my colleague Senator Sherry noted, the Japanese economy has been in great difficulties. As we went through the inquiry, there were some signs that the Japanese economy was emerging from its difficulties—but, of course, it has slipped back slightly since then. Nonetheless, it is a very important economy for Australia. The report shows that Japan gets somewhere in the vicinity of a 20 per cent share of Australia's total exports and that 14 per cent of Australia's total imports come to us from Japan. So it is a very significant market for Australian exporters.</para><para>One of the pluses to come out of Japan's economic woes has been the fact that Japan has had to modernise many of its practices in terms of its economy. It has had to remove some of the restrictions that were placed there that kept many overseas businesses from gaining access to the marketplace. So what we are seeing now are emerging opportunities for many Australian companies. Those opportunities will only be as good as our contacts with the Japanese at the governmental level, and I think that this report should encourage this government to do all it can to improve our relationship with the Japanese.</para><para>There is no doubt in my mind, from having been on this committee and involved in considering the depth of information that came to us, that there are emerging opportunities, particularly in the finance sector, the banking sector, the insurance sector and the IT sector. Opportunities are there which, if they are capitalised on, will help us greatly in our own economy.</para><para>Part of the problem we are confronted with, though, is the non-tariff barriers that are still put in place by the Japanese themselves. That is where this issue emerging out of the APEC report is so important, because APEC is that ideal vehicle for us to seek the removal of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. Whilst a lot of focus has been placed by many people on the tariff barriers that exist—they are quite real and they do place an inhibiting factor upon our exports or some of our potential exports to Japan—non-tariff barriers, which are just as inhibiting, exist also. Many of those are fairly seamless barriers that need to be dismantled. </para><para>Representatives of a housing group in Sydney who appeared before the committee told us of some of the problems that they had had getting their product into the Japanese market. Many of the problems that they were confronted with related to specifications, local building codes, the contracting of labour, getting supplies into the country and so on. There were a range of problems, none of which was related to a tariff directly—but they were related to non-tariff barriers that were put as obstacles to their becoming competitive in the marketplace.</para><para>The product that they had to sell was of world quality. Of course, when they actually got access to the market after a great deal of struggle, it was found that they were indeed very successful. But it was that initial breakthrough into the marketplace that was very hard for them. Part of that is due to the Japanese culture, but the other part is due to the non-tariff barriers that exist there. Australia should seek to use forums such as APEC to do all that it can to dismantle these tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers to assist the expansion of Australian industry. There are many industries here that could gain access once those barriers were dismantled.</para><para>The other thing that I want to briefly refer to is the importance of the export industry of tourism. Not many people inside Australia really see tourism as being an export industry, but, as my colleague Senator Sherry said, the number of tourists arriving here has increased dramatically since 1978 to 479,000 in 1990. It is interesting that during that year the number of Japanese tourists that came to Australia exceeded the number that came from other countries: New Zealand with 418,400, the United States with 250,000, the United Kingdom with 277,000, Canada with 53,000, Germany with 74,000 and Singapore with 75,000. So it can be seen that that is a very important export industry to us, though it did slip back during the economic crisis in Japan. That was very much brought home to us by the appearance of Qantas before the committee, where they outlined how they had had to cut back some of their flights to Japan. Hopefully now those numbers are on the increase again.</para><para>According to a BTR report, Japanese visitors spend an average of $114 per day when in Australia, whilst the average spent by other foreign tourists is $80 per day. You can see in that figure alone that there is a significant differential. Japanese tourists do go to a number of confined destinations within Australia: Sydney, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Cairns. That was another thing that came out in the report—that we need to get them back for repeat visits. We should not be just a one-stop market for them. It should not be that they come once and never again. They are an important part of our export market, and Australia's promotion of tourism to the Japanese as an export is very important indeed. I commend the report. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><page.no>17150</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>17150</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by<inline font-weight="bold"> Senator McKiernan</inline>:</para><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>17150</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take the opportunity rather briefly to make some comments pertinent to the content of the report, which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">A Sanctuary under review: an examination of Australia's refugee and humanitarian determination processes</inline>, without directly speaking to that. As I recall it, that report was tabled in this place on 28 June this year. The next day, 29 June, another report was tabled. It was that of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission entitled<inline font-style="italic"> Report of an inquiry into a complaint of acts or practices inconsistent with or contrary to human rights in an immigration detention centre</inline>, report No. 10. While the contents of this report do not address the terms of reference of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry, it would have been very interesting if the committee had had a copy of this report prior to the tabling of the refugee report in the Senate. It would have been even more important, I suggest, if the Joint Standing Committee on Migration had had a copy of this report and the findings contained in this report prior to its inspection of the detention centre at Perth in November last year. A report for that will be presented to the parliament on Monday next week. </para></talk.start><para>The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report is probably the last report tabled by Chris Sidoti as the then Human Rights Commissioner. Mr Sidoti has since retired from that position, having served the time that a human rights commissioner is appointed for. During his term as the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Sidoti gave tremendous assistance to a large number of committees of this parliament. He certainly appeared before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and legislation committees on a number of occasions. I am not saying that on every occasion I accepted the advice or the views being put forward by Mr Sidoti, but he certainly made one think when he put forward a proposition that invariably aided the work of the committee and the ongoing inquiry. Mr Sidoti certainly had a passion for the preservation and protection of human rights, not only in this country but throughout the world. Under section 29(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, it was one of his responsibilities as the Human Rights Commissioner to inquire into complaints about matters that happened in Australia's immigration detention centres.</para><para>Those complaints come from time to time. In this short interlude this evening, I do not want to address the content of the complaints or the findings that Mr Sidoti made about the particular individual who complained: Mr George Johnson, a Nigerian national who entered Australia at Perth airport without valid travel documents. He was detained in this country for some 12 months. What really concerns me appears on page 8 of the report, under 2.4, `Submissions and evidence'. The report states:</para><quote><para>On 23 May 1997 an officer of the Commission contacted the Department to advise of the complaint and to arrange for officers of the Commission to interview the complainant during their visit to the Perth IDC on 26 May 1997. On 23 May 1997 an officer of the Department advised the Commission that the complainant was at that stage being held in the Casuarina Prison and that arrangements would be made for the complainant to attend the Perth IDC at the time of the Commission's visit to the Perth IDC. Subsequently the Department advised the Commission that the complainant would not be able to be interviewed by the Commission as he was being removed from Australia on 26 May 1997.</para><para>Documents provided later by the Department indicate that arrangements were made to remove the complainant on 26 May 1997 prior to the Commission approaching the Department about the complaint. It also appears from the documents that, because the complainant refused to take prescribed travel medication, his removal from Australia was delayed until about 16 June 1997.</para><para>The Commission was not advised of the delay in the removal of the complainant, although the Department was aware that officers of the Commission were in Western Australia until 2 June 1997 and able to interview him about his allegations.</para></quote><para>I have not had a chance to test this matter with the officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, but you can be assured that will be tested at the first opportunity. If what I have quoted from this report is true, I find it appalling behaviour. If the allegations that an officer of the Commonwealth of Australia charged with the preservation of human rights in this country could be so misled by officers of the immigration department are true and factual, some of these people should be for the high jump. Mr Sidoti does not reach any findings on this matter, because it was not within his brief to undertake an examination of it. Obviously, his report is lacking because the officers of the commission were not able to interview the complainant. Clearly, from the dates that I have quoted from the report, the officers could have been in a position to undertake that interview and to get to the facts of the matter.</para><para>In my positions as Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on Migration and Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, a number of complaints are directed to me from persons within the detention centres in Australia. In the course of formulating the refugee report I am speaking to now, the committee received a number of allegations, some of which we referred directly to the police. My judgment on those matters—I must say this to the Senate, to the department and to the minister's office—will be coloured in the future by what has been portrayed in the report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I have never known the commission to exaggerate the facts. I know they are passionate about the causes that they are charged to look into and to protect, but I do not think they would go to the lengths of distorting the facts and the removal dates on this occasion. I would hope that would not be the case. </para><para>I do want to, however, give the department an opportunity—in formal session sometime—to come forward and tell their side of the story. We would then be in a position to adjudicate on the stories that are put in front of us, as we have been able to do through the many inquiries that we have conducted in the course of the various parliamentary committees in which I have participated over the years. When I read this, I felt quite sick, having the previous day delivered a report—which I believed was quite balanced—on the protection of refugees and the refugee determination system in this country. If Immigration officers or APS officers charged with the detention of people go to the lengths of covering up and avoiding people to make sure that officers of the commission are not able to examine complaints made about conditions in detention centres, it does bring the system into further disrepute. I say this in the week in which the riots have occurred at the Woomera Detention Centre, and there have been small disturbances at other detention centres. It does not augur well for the department or for the minister's office that these things are occurring. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>17152</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><quote><para>Privileges—Standing Committee—93rd report—Possible unauthorised disclosure of in camera proceedings of the Economics References Committee.

This commitment is manifested in support for research and development projects with clearly developed and focused commercial outcomes. One of the features of the Howard government is the integration and cooperation between the various ministries and, in relation to the issues I am talking about tonight, I commend the partnership and cooperation between the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, and the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile. </para></talk.start><para>The importance the federal government places on research and development is reflected in the government's focus on getting the policy settings for innovation right. Grants and tax concessions have their place, but I commend Senator Minchin for the progress he has made in getting the policy settings for innovation correct. The recommendations of the National Innovation Summit and the report following the commissioning of the Science Capability Review are important elements in the government's innovation action plan, which will clearly identify and address future innovation priorities for Australia. This plan will be in place by the end of the year. I think we should take some time in this adjournment debate tonight to look at a number of components of that. Firstly, there is technology, which is an important part of the world competitive business strategy. We have seen some excellent examples coming to the fore because of the current government's initiatives. To mention but one, the Prime Minister recently launched the $40 million technology based Intelligent Island Program in my home state of Tasmania, made possible by the sale of the second tranche of Telstra.</para><para>The word `technology' is used frequently and quite often loosely. But what is `technology'? It is the practical knowledge, the know-how, the skills and the artefacts that can be used to develop new products or services as well as their production and delivery systems. The concept involves three elements: product technology, process technology and management technology. In addition to technology we require innovation. In a progressive society, technology is here today but becomes rapidly obsolete. As new technologies come on line, applications create or revolutionise demand. The concept of innovation implies discovery of something that existed before, although we may not have known about it, and invention of something that did not exist before and is brand new. To be successful innovation must work; technological innovation, to be commercially successful, must provide a return on investment.</para><para>Just as `position, position, position' is the key to real estate purchasing, creativity is critical to the corporate climate. This creativity is essential for health, happiness and success in business, especially in starting new ventures. Change has become an essential part of our way of life and creating the right environment is particularly important. It is up to governments to create a climate in which people react positively to change rather than take troglodyte positions. Governments must also encourage entrepreneurial forces which must focus on opportunities. These people must have real commitment to seizing those opportunities at the same time as accepting reasonable risk. Corporate research and development is a crucial component of the wealth creation process and is essential to maintaining our international competitiveness. Governments have a large role to play in encouraging innovation and, therefore, research and development. They must provide leadership and vision and champion the causes of those who are prepared to take risks. They must create the environment in which innovation can flourish. </para><para>I take this opportunity of commending the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, for his achievements to date. I encourage him to continue and expand this good work, especially in the area of research and development. Research and development, as I mentioned earlier, is more than just throwing money and tax concessions at R&amp;D. The National Innovation Summit, which I referred to earlier, brought together leaders from business, government and academic organisations to pinpoint and deal with pivotal issues. I will share some of those findings with the Senate tonight. Firstly, business confidence must be promoted by making sure that risk taking is rewarded and that regulation is not a burden. Secondly, internationally competitive incentives, including taxation concessions, grants, loans and venture capital, are necessary to support the full range of innovation activities. Most important is that an educational system be developed that is appropriate to a knowledge based economy. Here the work of Dr Kemp really comes to the fore. One must expect nowadays that lifelong learning is the norm—learning that responds to the needs of business, that expects and feeds off inputs from industry and that inculcates the concepts and fundamentals of entrepreneurialism from an early age.</para><para>There is a need in Australia—I think it is appropriate at this time of the Olympics—to raise this concept that we must develop a sports-like pride and passion in the whole community to develop our innovative achievements. These must be recognised at the start to invest in a world-class research environment, and this must be the foundation for the future. In order to apply the summit's findings, a post-summit high-level implementation group is continuing the partnership model of business, research, education and government, with three senior representatives from each sector. Their report to the minister is imminent. I take this opportunity to applaud this group's ongoing work and their commitment to innovation.</para><para>As a government, we must encourage and reward investment and innovation to ensure that Australia participates in the global benefits of innovation and subsequent reward and growth. I therefore encourage greater government support for innovation and urge Australian industry and business, large and small, to enthusiastically embrace research and development to ensure higher growth in this very important area, because, as such, Australians' living standards will be enhanced and Australia will take its place rightfully as one of the leading nations of this world.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Misinformation</title><page.no>17154</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>17154</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to speak about misinformation, particularly as it relates to the drug problem. Misinformation is one of the greatest obstacles preventing progress in the debate regarding the use of mood altering drugs in our community. In the term `drugs', I include the use of alcohol and tobacco for, in case some of you have not realised, those drugs account for well over 90 per cent of drug related deaths in Australia. Unfortunately, there will be no mention of alcohol and tobacco in the Howard government's mail-out to families in Australia. Thus, the information is unlikely to have much credibility amongst our young people who can spot hypocrisy a mile off. </para></talk.start><para>Although the government attempts to ignore the importance of legal drugs, our young people are not fooled. Research conducted in Perth using a sample size of over 1,000 young people found that alcohol and tobacco were implicated as important gateway drugs. This was contained in the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Stages of drug use: community survey of Perth teenagers</inline>. The mail-out interfered with by the Prime Minister's office sends the message to young people, `You can drink and smoke yourself to death but if you use anything else we will force you to stop.' The young will see that message as one of `do what I say, not what I do'. Young people are not stupid. They will take little notice of a message that reeks of double standards.</para><para>Recently, Senator McGauran claimed there was no evidence that safe injecting rooms reduced rates of death by overdose. This statement was not sourced and contradicts research summarised by the Lindesmith Center in a document called <inline font-style="italic">Evaluation of safe injecting rooms, </inline>which found evidence that they are successful in reducing injection related risks and harms, including vein damage, drug overdose deaths and transmission of disease. I think we need to be very aware of that, particularly because we have not had a great outbreak of some of the diseases that other countries have had from injecting drug users. His statement did not seem to take into account the fall in overdose deaths in Frankfurt or the conclusions of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction summarised in their recent annual report. But supporters of zero tolerance very rarely let truth get in the way of a good story. </para><para>Some comment was made regarding the increased interception of drugs coming into the country, and a comparison was made between numbers and quantities of seizures during our tenure in government and the present government's. Simply, there have been more seized because there are more coming in. This in no way reflects on the hard work of the agencies involved. But the street price and the ease of purchase give a better indication of the success of attempts to reduce supply. </para><para>Official figures show that drugs are cheaper, purer and more available than they were five years ago. Demand and supply have both increased rapidly in the last five years, and supply has been increasing even faster than demand.  If there had been a reduction in supply, the price should go up and the purity should have dropped. But this has not happened. So those indications are that there is more available, it is cheaper and it is purer. In fact, the Tough on Drugs strategy has seen a dramatic rise in overdose deaths and an increase of the `them and us' mentality. The government seems to believe that we can arrest and imprison our way out of this terrible situation with illicit drugs, even though none of the experts, including the law enforcement experts, believe this.</para><para>We have to accept that illicit drugs are primarily health and social issues. Health and social spending should match law enforcement spending. The debate on safe injecting rooms is a direct result of the Howard government's rejection of the heroin trial, despite a 6-3 majority of health and police ministers supporting a heroin trial, including their own health and justice ministers. That year, the number of drug overdose deaths increased by 23 per cent.</para><para>Drug use in most cases is a transitory problem, such as excessive drinking. We have to keep people alive and well while they use drugs so that they are still able to come back into the community when they reach the point of wanting to stop. Relying on incarceration, as this government recommends, is relying on an expensive way of making a bad problem worse. We only have to look at the American situation to see that. But none of these things were teased out in a speech given on what I would prefer to call harm reduction centres rather than safe injecting rooms. We should not overlook the many other health advantages in having these rooms, nor should we overlook the benefits these rooms have to people who do not inject drugs, including neighbourhood residents. </para><para>Why should residents of a neighbourhood where drug injecting has become established have to watch people injecting in public places just so that narrow-minded people can send a message to the whole world that they want to be righteous? We should rather send a message that government cares about our young people, including some who have made a bad mistake and started using illegal drugs. Obviously, a trial of a harm reduction room would not help those who do not frequent them. However, the international experience shows that injecting drug rooms do save lives of young people and do help to get drug injectors into treatment. Who could possibly oppose those objectives?</para><para>The Prime Minister recently launched a diversion scheme in Victoria with Premier Steve Bracks. While anything that diverts young people from prison is to be commended, it will merely scratch the surface of an ever increasing prison population that is largely full of those committing crimes to finance addictions. Mr Howard said that no-one should go to jail due to an addiction. These are commendable words, but the current approach is just more of the same. That is why Labor have given their support to various trials. We need especially to get into treatment the heaviest users in the community—the people who have not previously been tempted into treatment or who have tried treatment and nothing has unfortunately worked. I say `unfortunately' because helping these people—keeping them out of jail and getting them off drugs—is good for them, their families and the whole community. </para><para>We have to have the courage to admit that what we are doing now is not working; we must try new things. Eleven years ago, in their report <inline font-style="italic">Drugs, crime and society: 1989</inline>, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority said:</para><quote><para>Over the past two decades in Australia we have devoted increased resources to drug law enforcement, we have increased the penalties for drug trafficking and we have accepted increasing inroads on our civil liberties as part of the battle to curb the drug trade. All the evidence shows, however, not only that our law enforcement agencies have not succeeded in preventing the supply of illegal drugs to Australian markets but that it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.</para></quote><para>The members of that committee included Senator Alston and Senator Hill, two senior members of the present government. Thus I suggest that, until we completely overhaul our entire approach to drug use in our society, we will see little change. Similarly, until the Australian National Council on Drugs, the ANCD, has the political freedom it needs to perform its important tasks—separated from the destructive interference of the Prime Minister's office—the skills of the good people on that committee will be relegated to political opportunism, with outcomes being more of the same: more deaths, more disease, more crime, more prisons and more corruption.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces: Amalgamation</title><page.no>17156</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>17156</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight, in view of the defence consultations that have been held across the country in connection with Australia's future defence needs, I want to flag an option that should be included in any overall review—that is, that consideration be given to an amalgamation of Australian and New Zealand defence forces. This would lead to the creation of a new ANZAC force, if you like, building on the famous traditions of the past, and perhaps even a common currency will come in time too. But global demands and political realities will in time favour both of those initiatives.</para></talk.start><para>There is a history of proposals for amalgamation of the public functions between Australia and New Zealand. These proposals, with some degree of success, contain the word `closer'—as in closer economic relations, CER, and closer defence relations, CDR. The `closer' concept suggests that moves in this direction might be viewed as a good idea but that neither country wants to take it too far too quickly. Especially in the area of national defence, this viewpoint would be encompassed in the idea of citizens of two sovereign nations wishing that their governments retain control of defence processes. But defence capability is about giving governments of the day options as to the way they respond to international and regional conflicts. It is hard to imagine that Australia and New Zealand would disagree in a way so fundamental that an amalgamated defence force would be a problem.</para><para>Over time Australia and New Zealand have drawn closer in their defence links—from the very early days, where in the Boer War we sent a joint contingent, to the First World War, Gallipoli and the creation of Anzac Day and the Anzac spirit. In June 1944, towards the end of the Second World War, both countries ratified the Australia-New Zealand agreement called the ANZAC Pact. This required defence cooperation in the event of a threat and is seen as a pre-cursor of the ANZUS alliance. In World War II and in regional conflicts and peacekeeping since, Australia and New Zealand have served alongside each other as one.</para><para>In 1977 defence minister Killen and defence minister McCreedy reached an agreement on Australia-New Zealand defence cooperation. The tangible result of this was better sharing of the task of surveillance done by the Orion maritime patrol aircraft of both countries. In this context New Zealand's decision last week not to upgrade their six Orion aircraft is particularly disappointing. You have to wonder what the New Zealand electorate makes of a government apparently so unconcerned about their maritime approaches and exclusive economic zone of 320 kilometres that they allowed that decision to be made. But it seems to serve as confirmation that New Zealand appears determined to become more isolationist—with this substantially based, I suggest, on the politics of their budget. In May 1991 Minister Robert Ray introduced closer defence relations, CDR, with the intention of fostering better coordination between both countries in decisions affecting issues such as equipment purchases and force structure. Again little occurred with the coordination in force structure development, but the purchase by New Zealand of two Anzac frigates, although reached before CDR, perhaps inspired it. The New Zealand option for a further two frigates is unlikely to be exercised at this time. </para><para>New Zealand forces do not have sufficient strength to operate independently, except in some limited circumstances in the south-west Pacific. Their army numbers are scarcely adequate for a brigade, of which Australia has two on short-readiness alert. The New Zealand army are being restructured for peacekeeping activities but, clearly, even in that role their position is questionable. The New Zealand army were able to sustain its commitment to the Truce Monitoring Group, TMG, established in Bougainville in December 1997 for only a few weeks before rotation of personnel and damage to vehicles and equipment apparently became unsupportable. From the end of April 1998 the Australian Defence Force has had to take responsibility for the Peace Monitoring Group, which superseded the Truce Monitoring Group.</para><para>The Royal New Zealand Navy has only two effective warships—the third is in mothballs—which is simply insufficient to maintain a surface warship in a trouble spot or to meet contingencies such as Timor, where New Zealand has 700 personnel presently deployed. Given the need to rotate vessels on station and maintenance requirements, three ships are usually viewed as a minimum to sustain and maintain a naval presence. The Royal New Zealand Air Force has ageing A4 fighter strike aircraft; they are short ranged and have always relied on access to Australian and other overseas airfields to have any strategic role. In fact, Australia presently leases these New Zealand aircraft to attack Australian forces on naval exercises off the east coast of Australia.</para><para>New Zealand's navy and air force—supplemented in the nineties with limited naval logistic capability but losing its medium airlift capability—lacks sufficient capacity to deploy forces overseas in all but the most special cases without Australian assistance. Australia's forces have to some degree been supplemented and improved by the placement of a 2nd Brigade on short alert. Nevertheless, as the deployment in East Timor demonstrated, overall Army and Army Reserve numbers were insufficient to support operations for any length of time, leading to the Australian government deciding in November 1999 to increase the number of operational infantry battalions from four to six, or another 3,000 personnel. Australia has clearly been forced to address shortcomings in its ability to sustain forces in even comparatively minor circumstances. Still, the ADF will have spent over $500 million on equipment to support its deployment in East Timor. This is still more than 35 per cent of the New Zealand defence budget.</para><para>Since the ANZUS agreement was suspended with regard to New Zealand in 1985, New Zealand forces have had limited access to US technology and exercise experience with US forces. The ADF has attempted to compensate for this to some extent. In addition, over 20 per cent of the 51 joint exercises planned by the ADF with other nations in the forthcoming year, 2000-01, are with the New Zealand defence forces.</para><para>What are the implications of these changes? It can be said that the New Zealand armed forces have little potential by themselves yet are a professional—and in some areas modern—force. New Zealand defence policy continues to give weight to a requirement to operate in conjunction with the ADF. In many conceivable circumstances, such as in East Timor, this would be the case. In others circumstances, where it might operate alone, New Zealand will be dependent on the ADF for transport and logistics support, as was the case in establishing the TMG in Bougainville. </para><para>In many practical circumstances, then, the ADF and the New Zealand Defence Force are an integrated force—but without acknowledgment and without planning. These aspects—acknowledgment and planning—have to be addressed if a combined force were to become a reality. The former is largely a political issue of gaining support within both countries for the idea. The latter will require concentrated study and would involve senior personnel from both sides. Such an approach could be initiated through constant contact by senior officers of both forces. A way of achieving this would be to establish perhaps a joint Australia-New Zealand headquarters charged with planning joint operational plans and commanding joint operations. Increasingly, the purview of this body could expand to planning the future force for both countries. Executive decision making could continue to reside with the sovereign governments of both countries. This would require constant negotiation but not negate the progress which this structure could achieve over time. It would not be simple, but it would be in the best interests of the defence effort of two close neighbours and friends. I look forward to this proposal being further discussed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Vibrational Individuation Program</title><page.no>17158</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>17158</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honourable senators may recall that in April of last year I raised in this chamber my concerns about a dangerous cult which went by the name of the Vibrational Individuation Program. Among the practices of that cult was the imposition on its members of bizarre diets of offal and the like by the two leaders of the cult, these diets being determined by a so-called food test. A person undergoing the food test lies on a couch while the therapist observes the response of the wrist and surrounding muscles as she reads through a checklist of food items. Depending on the response, the therapist determines which foods are to be eaten exclusively, how they are to be cooked or prepared, the quantity to be eaten, how often and for how long.</para></talk.start><para>After my exposure of this cult, many people contacted me to discuss the detrimental effect on their health and their family life which their involvement with this cult over various periods of time had caused. It was therefore with some alarm that it has come to my attention that the Vibrational Individuation Program have lodged an application with Burnside council in metropolitan Adelaide, in the inner suburbs of Adelaide, to set up their operations in premises at 76A Kensington Road, Rose Park, just on the outskirts of the city of Adelaide. They are seeking approval to establish what they describe as `nutritional based complementary medicine rooms' to be used as a consulting area for a supposed nutritional professional and as an education centre for the general community.</para><para>As previously detailed in those remarks some 15 or 16 months ago, the diets often prescribed by the two principal exponents of this program are anything but nutritional and are potentially damaging to health. As for complementary medicine, the danger the group poses is evident from the advice that the cult leader gave to adherents that it did not matter whether what was later diagnosed as a class 4 melanoma was left untouched or removed. As honourable senators may know, a class 4 melanoma is the second highest level of melanoma, a class 5 being the highest. This is the sort of quasi-medical advice that the leaders of this cult give to their adherents: that a class 4 melanoma can be left untouched and does not need medical attention.</para><para>I believe it would be unacceptable were the Burnside council to approve this particular application. If the application were approved, the premises would give the group exposure and accessibility to the general community which they have not enjoyed in the past, and that could certainly result in many more unsuspecting people being sucked into their bizarre practices, ultimately with detrimental consequences. I believe that it is important that the community are made aware of this danger, and certainly that Burnside council are fully aware of the nature of this organisation when they consider this application. I strongly urge the Burnside council to reject the application. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>17159</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.39 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>17159</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>17159</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Air Services Act—Direction under section 6—Instrument M26/2000.</para><para>Christmas Island Act—List of applied Western Australian Acts for the period 11 March to 25 August 2000.</para><para>Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act—List of applied Western Australian Acts for the period 11 March to 25 August 2000.</para><para>Corporations Act—Accounting Standard AASB 1005—Segment Reporting.</para><para>Defence Act—Determination under section 58B—Defence Determination 2000/26.</para><para>Migration Act—Certificates under section 502, dated 15 August 2000 [3].</para><para>Parliamentary Service Act—Parliamentary Service (Consequential and Transitional) Determination 2000/1.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew Act—Dispensation granted under section 20—Dispensation No. 11/00.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>17159</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996 as amended 3 December 1998:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 January to 30 June 2000—Statements of compliance—Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>17160</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Department of Industry, Science and Resources Research</title><page.no>17160</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1987)</subtitle><id.no>1987</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>17160</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 3 March 2000:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Has the department, or any agency of the department, commissioned or conducted any quantitative and/or qualitative public opinion research (including tracking research) since 1 October 1998, related to the goods and services tax (GST) and the new tax system;

No car allowances are paid other than reimbursement for use of private vehicle to travel to and from Council meetings, if these are less than the equivalent airfare.  Reimbursement for private cars is based on the standard Public Service rates.  Cab charges are provided for use in airport transfers for Council meetings.

As a signatory to the Chicago Convention, Australia has an obligation to provide the minimum level of ARFFS standards as defined in Annex 14.

A Memorandum of Understanding was formalised between CASA and Airservices Australia for the interim regulation of Airway Services including Air Traffic, Rescue and Fire Fighting and Airways Engineering signed by both the CASA and Airservices Boards on 14 August 1995.  The Memorandum of Understanding has evolved into the current <inline font-style="italic">Safety Regulation of Airservices Australia and Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Service Providers, Final Draft Regulatory Arrangements and Standards, April 1996,</inline> that reflects the ICAO requirements.

As stated above, Australia has no legislatively based standard for the provision of ARFFS.  Since the inception of CASA, a draft document (referenced in Question 2 above) has been developed to reflect the ICAO requirements.  This draft document outlines the present standards applied to ARFFS.  CASA is currently developing regulations to replace this informal document and a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM 002AS <inline font-style="italic">Regulatory Standards For Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Service</inline>) has been released in this regard and is available at the CASA website (www.casa.gov.au).

Assistance provided to the federal electorate of Bass under the TWFS is not identified separately within the program.</para><para>Funding provided through the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) for programs administered by AFFA in the federal electorate of Bass amounted to $0.48 million in 1999-2000.  These programs are the National Landcare Program, National Rivercare Program, Fisheries Action Program and Farm Forestry Program.  </para><para>The New Industries Development Program provided grants of $32,000 in 1999-2000. The program is designed to support the development of new agribusiness products and services through a range of initiatives including funding for pilot commercialisation projects. </para><para>The PorkBiz business skills training program provided $7,350 under the National Component of the Commonwealth FarmBis program, for a workshop held in Launceston during the 1999-2000 financial year. </para><para>The Tasmanian Quality Pork program, under the National Pork Industry Development Program (NPIDP), provided $337 for quality assurance training during the 1999-2000 financial year. </para><para>FarmBis funding is not allocated on a regional basis or by electorates. However, funding for the state of Tasmania in the 1999-2000 financial year was $229,018.</para><para>The Financial Counselling Service, part of the Rural Communities Program, provided funding of $107,893 in 1999-2000 in the federal electorate of Bass through Rural Support Tasmania. It should be noted that this group receives funding for two financial counselling positions.  One counsellor operates from Launceston (in the electorate of Bass) and one from Glenorchy (electorate of Denison).  Both counsellors service clients in more than one electorate.</para><para>The exceptional circumstances relief payment (ECRP) assists farm families in exceptional circumstances (EC) areas who are experiencing difficulties meeting personal living expenses. The ECRP is currently available to farmers on Flinders Island in the electorate of Bass. Flinders Island was declared in drought EC on 8 April 1998. Expenditure on ECRP in 1999-2000 to 31 May 2000 totals approximately $183,000. EC interest rate subsidies are also available to drought affected farmers on Flinders Island. During 1999-2000, up to May 2000, the value of applications approved was $144,210, of which $127,578 was funded by the Commonwealth and $16,632 by the State.</para><para>The Farm Family Restart Scheme, which the Government is enhancing to become Farm Help - Supporting Families Through Change, provides income support, professional advice and re-establishment assistance. The Farm Family Restart /Farm Help Scheme is available to all eligible farmers on a national basis. Information on Farm Family Restart /Farm Help Scheme is not available on an electorate basis. However, expenditure for Farm Family Restart /Farm Help Scheme in Tasmania during 1999-2000 (to 31 May) has totalled around $1.2 million. </para><para>The Farm Management Deposit (FMD) Scheme is available to all eligible farmers in Australia and provides a tax-linked savings mechanism that allows farmers to set aside pre-tax income from years of good cash flow for use in years of low cash flow.  The Scheme operates from private financial institutions and information on the utilisation of the scheme is not available on an electorate basis.  The level of funding is nil, as FMDs are not `grants'.  There is a `cost to revenue', for tax income foregone in the year that individuals make an FMD deposit, associated with FMDs.  This is partially offset when FMDs are withdrawn and treated as taxable income, as well as through the impact of tax on interest earned on deposits.  </para><para>The level of funding provided through the Rural GST Start-up Assistance Program in the federal electorate of Bass in the 1999-2000 financial year was $27,500.
