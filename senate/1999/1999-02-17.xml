Based on data provided by the Australian Customs Service (ACS) and on information obtained by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), it is estimated that medication subsidised to the value of some $20 million per annum is being exported inappropriately.</para><para>The bill provides the ACS with the power to detain medication in cases where the Customs officer forms the view that the medication is not for the personal use of the person who is either carrying or shipping the medication overseas. Medication detained by a Customs officer will be transferred to the HIC. The Customs officer has a discretion to detain only some of the medication, allowing the raveller to retain the remainder.</para><para>The HIC will be responsible for determining whether or not a Commonwealth benefit has been paid for the medication. The medication will be forfeited to the Commonwealth unless the medication is not a prescription drug; or that no Commonwealth benefit has been paid or is payable; or it is for the personal use of the person concerned.</para><para>The bill allows the Chief Executive Officer of the ACS to issue guidelines for the use of Customs officers relating to the examination of baggage, detention of medication, transfer of medication to the HIC, and copying and retaining documents provided in relation to the medication.</para><para>The bill further provides that the HIC may issue guidelines for the use of HIC officers when dealing with medication transferred from the ACS, dealing with claims for the return of medication, and dealing with the disposal of medication that has been forfeited to the Commonwealth.</para><para>Where the HIC establishes that the detained medications are prescription drugs, it must notify the exporter that an application may be made within 60 days for the return of the medication. The HIC must consider any submissions seeking the return of the medication. In order for the medication to be forfeited and destroyed, the HIC must apply to a court for an order authorising the proper destruction of the medication. 
</para><para>These provisions are meant to address situations where a person is attempting to carry or send large quantities of medication overseas; quantities which cannot reasonably be considered to be for personal use; where the prescription labels do not relate to the person who has possession or control of the medication; or where the prescription labels have been removed or defaced so as not to allow identification of the person to whom they were supplied.</para><para>The bill specifies a formula, for most medication allowing at least 12 months' supply, under which the possession or attempted export of a greater quantity constitutes a prima facie offence. The bill does not affect travellers who are entitled to medication subsidised under the PBS and which are for the traveller's personal use or are for the personal use of a person accompanying the traveller.</para><para>The National Health Act 1953 currently prohibits a person from disposing of a PBS medication in a manner not intended in the prescription. This includes selling or exporting the medication overseas. The bill will now allow the HIC to address the situation where the subsidised medication is in the possession of another person or is being forwarded overseas by a person for whom the medication was not prescribed.</para><para>The bill has been the subject of extensive consultation between the HIC, the ACS, the Department of Health and Aged Care, the Attorney-General's Department and the office of Director of Public Prosecutions. The work on this bill was initiated by a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in its report <inline font-style="italic">Concessions—Who benefits?</inline></para><para>In conjunction with this legislation, the HIC will undertake action to inform potential travellers, prescribers and pharmacists of the amendments to the National Health Act 1953. The information will be advertised in professional and travel publications, on ethnic radio and in ethnic newspapers.</para><para>I now commend the bill.</para><para>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to increase the attractiveness of the Australian Capital Territory to potential investors by removing the perceived disincentive to business and other investment brought about by the limit of land tenure to 99-year estates, as distinct from freehold title enjoyed elsewhere in Australia.</para><para>The objectives of strengthening land tenure security and allowing the ACT Legislative Assembly to extend ACT leases from 99 years to 999 years were 
 stated in the Coalition Policy on the National Capital in both 1996 and 1998.</para><para>Section 9 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 provides that no Crown lands in the Territory may be sold or disposed of for freehold estates.</para><para>The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 provides for land in the act to be National Land or Territory Land. National Land is land so declared by the Commonwealth Minister as land used or intended to be used by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. Land that is not National Land is Territory Land. The ACT Government manages Territory Land on behalf of the Commonwealth and may grant, dispose of, acquire, hold and administer estates in Territory Land.</para><para>The ACT Government sought an amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 to enable it to issue leases for a maximum term of 999 years. The Chief Minister, Mrs Carnell, has cited the 99-year limit as antiquated and unduly restrictive. ACT business representatives have supported the proposed amendment. A regulation impact statement is included in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>This bill is consistent with the Australian Capital Territory being a self-governing territory.</para><para>The proposed amendment was first introduced into the House of Representatives as the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1997 on 4 December 1997 and was passed by the House without amendment on 10 March 1998. It was introduced into the Senate on 12 March 1998.</para><para>The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 12 March 1998. The committee tabled its report in April 1998 with the majority recommending that the bill be passed without amendment. The committee concluded that the bill is an appropriate form of enabling legislation allowing the ACT Legislative Assembly to enact a change of leasehold term from a maximum possible term of 99 years to 999 years.</para><para>Following its inquiries of the ACT Government as to the machinery proposed for administration of any changes to the term of ACT leasehold approved by the Commonwealth Parliament, the committee was satisfied that the passage of the bill should be supported.</para><para>Effect of the bill</para><para>The proposed amendment will increase the maximum permissible limit for the grant of new estates in Territory Land to 999 years. The bill will not provide for automatic extension of existing estates. 
 A leaseholder seeking a term longer than 99 years will need to apply to the ACT Government for a new grant.</para><para>The ACT Government has indicated that a modest administrative charge will apply to the grant of new leases to existing leaseholders, provided no terms of the lease, other than the lease period, are changed.</para><para>The proposed amendment removes the reference to `or such longer period as is prescribed' so that no terms of estate greater than 999 years will be possible.</para><para>The Regulations currently applicable which relate to 999-year leases granted for tertiary education or church purposes prior to the introduction of Self-Government in the ACT will be unaffected by the proposed amendment.</para><para>The act is proposed to take effect upon receiving the Royal Assent.</para><para>Financial Impact</para><para>The proposed amendment will have no direct impact on Commonwealth revenue or outgoings. However, it is intended that the amendment will bring positive effects to the ACT economy by increasing the Territory's attractiveness to investors.</para><para>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>This bill represents an important moment in the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia. This bill encompasses the first component of a package of reforms designed to provide a new and appropriate framework for the regulation and management of complementary medicines. This bill also makes a number of more general amendments to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</para><para>It is estimated that over 60 percent of Australians use complementary health care products at least once a year. These include vitamins, minerals, herbal, naturopathic and/or homoeopathic preparations with therapeutic properties.</para><para>There are now around 17,000 such products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and an estimated 6,000 complementary medicine practitioners (not including massage therapists) operating in Australia.</para><para>In December last year I announced the formation of a Working Party, bringing together industry representatives, consumers and Government, to develop reforms in the regulation of complementary medicines. Along with many of my colleagues on both sides of the Senate, I considered this extremely important given the growing use and acceptance 
 of complementary health care products in this country and throughout the world.</para><para>Both government and industry have been struggling to balance the need to improve market access with the need to uphold consumer confidence. Reviewing advertising regulations, substantiation of therapeutic claims and post market vigilance are critical issues to government, industry and consumers alike. It is also essential to secure the ongoing involvement of the complementary medicines industry in providing advice to government and evaluating and regulating complementary medicines.</para><para>I am delighted that the Working Party was able to address these issues and agree on a well considered and comprehensive framework for complementary medicines which addresses market access, the ongoing control of complementary medicines and most importantly the maintenance of public health and safety through co-operation and regulation.</para><para>The package of reforms for complementary medicines includes some legislative changes, some changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act regulations, major administrative reforms plus information and consultative initiatives.</para><para>The bill that I am presenting today includes the legislative component of complementary medicine reforms. It ensures that through appropriate regulation, the Australian public can be confident that the medicines they consume and medical devices that they use are safe, effective and of a high quality.</para><para>In summary, the bill makes amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in three key respects:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Firstly</inline> , it amends key definitions in the act to provide greater clarity and certainty in relation to the application of the legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Secondly,</inline>  it includes amendments which acknowledge the shift of focus from pre-market clearance to post market vigilance for low-risk `listable' goods. This is achieved by, for example, providing a more streamlined and efficient process to enable sponsors to market low risk products without undue delay while ensuring that consumers continue to be protected from unsafe products.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Thirdly</inline> , this bill includes a new part in the act that establishes as a statutory body, the existing Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee.</para><para>The opportunity has also been taken, with agreement from industry, to address other matters in the bill including the establishment of the existing National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee as a statutory committee and the inclusion of a new Part which describes penalties and offences in relation to the publication of advertisements which have not been pre-cleared.</para><para>Allow me to explain the key components of the bill in a little more detail. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendments to Definitions</inline></para><para>The bill amends key definitions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the act) to provide a better interface between foods, complementary medicines and other medicines such as over the counter and prescription medicines. Changes have been made to reduce confusion at the food-therapeutic goods interface and make it clear when a good is a therapeutic good (regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration) and when it is a food (to be dealt with by the Australian and New Zealand Food Authority).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Enhanced market access and increased post market vigilance</inline></para><para>A number of amendments to the bill operate in conjunction with each other to improve market access for complementary medicines while at the same time increasing post market monitoring to ensure that consumers continue to access only safe and reliable products.</para><para>At present, once the TGA is satisfied that a substance is sufficiently low risk for its intended purpose, such goods may be eligible for `listing' in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). These goods are referred to as `listable' goods. However, changes to the documentation of goods that qualify as `listable' goods requires an amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. This is a cumbersome process that often fails to accommodate the commercial realities involved in enabling low-risk products to become publicly available.</para><para>To address this problem, the amendments contained in this bill propose the use of a gazettal notice by the Minister in lieu of an amendment to regulations. This will enable a quicker, more responsive process to be adopted to achieve the same results—that is, low risk products gaining swift access to the market and consumers having access to new products more quickly.</para><para>Quicker market access does not mean marketing of less safe products or misleading marketing claims. The bill confirms the existing condition that requires the sponsor to hold evidence supporting any claims.</para><para>This supporting evidence will not be required as a matter of routine but will be called upon in cases where there is a clear public health or safety matter at issue or where there has been deliberately or recklessly misleading information provided to the public about a product. The level of evidence that will be required, will be directly related to the risk associated with the product and the nature of the claim made about the product. However, it is important to note that testimonials alone are not acceptable proof of efficacy. The Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee will advise the TGA and sponsors on appropriate levels of evi 
 dence for claims made for various substances and products.</para><para>The combination of these measures will help facilitate growth in the area of complementary medicines and promote public confidence that the complementary health care products marketed in Australia are safe, effective and of a high quality.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee</inline></para><para>The Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee (CMEC) was established in December 1997. This bill will strengthen and enhance the standing of the Committee and complementary health care products generally by establishing CMEC as a statutory committee.</para><para>The establishment of CMEC as a statutory committees under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 is an acknowledgment of the growing significance of this industry and the need to improve the government's access to expertise in this area. This will provide an opportunity for expert, experienced and appropriate input into the evaluation of medicines and for important issues to be discussed amongst peers both within and outside the public sector.</para><para>This legislative change, will also be accompanied by a range of administrative reforms aimed at improving the management of complementary medicines and ensuring the involvement of industry and consumers in policy making. For example, I will be setting up an Office of Complementary Medicines within the Therapeutic Goods Administration, responsible for the regulation of the complementary medicines industry and staffed by senior and experienced personnel. I will also be inviting consumer and industry groups to join a Complementary Health Care Consultative Forum.</para><para>Another critical issue which the government intends to address through administrative reform is the advertising of therapeutic goods. It is recognised by both the TGA and industry that the existing Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code is somewhat outdated and no longer meets the needs of industry or government. The TGA has therefore undertaken to conduct a comprehensive review of the Code and the guidelines issued in relation to the Code.</para><para>The aim of the review will be to create a system of regulation in relation to advertising which is: simple; easily understood by advertisers, sponsors and the media; consistent with modern best practice; and capable of addressing a range of products and claims so that consumers can be appropriately informed. The review will, of course, be characterised by extensive consultation and expert input, particularly from the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, in addition to the reforms proposed in respect of complementary medicines, the opportunity has also been take to make some 
 more general amendments which improve the application of the therapeutic goods legislation in respect of all medicines and devices.</para><para>One such amendment formalises existing arrangements in relation to the scheduling of drugs and poisons. The bill creates a new Part in the act which establishes the existing National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee. The Committee's functions include: making decisions in relation to the classification and scheduling of substances; maintaining the Poisons Standard; and providing advice to government on legislative restrictions and policies in relation to substances.</para><para>It should be noted that this Part of the bill, including the definitions adopted specifically for this Part, do not relate to the reforms in respect of complementary medicines. The Part focuses specifically on the work of the existing Commonwealth/State body known as the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee.</para><para>Another more general amendment included in the bill relates to offences and penalties for publication of advertisements in mainstream print media for which prior approval for such publication has not been obtained.</para><para>These offences and penalties previously resided in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. They are however, much more appropriately placed in the Therapeutic Goods Act itself.</para><para>The penalties have been increased from $1,100 to $11,000 to bring them more in line with penalties for the broadcast of product advertisements and to reflect the Government's commitment to ensuring that advertisements which have a wide audience have been appropriately cleared.</para><para>In closing, I believe that this bill introduces important amendments which will improve the capacity of the legislation to appropriately regulate complementary health care products and other medicines and other therapeutic goods. The reforms provide a unique opportunity to achieve a co-operative approach to health care and provide assurances to the Australian public that the medicines they consume are safe, effective and of a high quality.</para><para>I commend the bill to you.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the winter sittings of 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that these bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title><type>Address in Reply</type><page.no>2037</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Address-in-Reply</title><page.no>2037</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 30 November 1998, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline>:</para><para>That the following Address-in-Reply be agreed to:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">To His Excellency the Governor-General</inline></para><para>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY—</para><para>We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the address-in-reply be presented to His Excellency the Governor-General by the President and such senators as may desire to accompany her.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I inform honourable senators that I have ascertained that His Excellency the Governor-General will be pleased to receive the address-in-reply to his opening speech at Government House on Thursday, 18 February 1999 at 6 p.m. I extend an invitation to all honourable senators to accompany me on the occasion of its presentation.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>2037</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title><page.no>2037</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That on Thursday, 18 February 1999, the Senate adjourn at 5.40 p.m. without the question being put, for the purposes of presenting the address-in-reply to the Governor-General.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2037</page.no><id.no>r653</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2037</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 15 February, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2037</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 and in doing so point out that this is, in the vernacular, a crook bill on electoral 
 matters. It is shameful of the government to bring in this bill with the measures it contains.</para></talk.start><para>From 1983, the former Labor government and the former minister in charge of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, my colleague from South Australia Mick Young, established a process where the parliament would have due process over reviewing each election, dealing with issues of electoral administration in a timely and considered manner and trying to reach bipartisanship on the way in which we conduct our elections.</para><para>Australia has every right to be generally proud of the fact that, at the national level, the conduct of elections since Federation has been very good by world standards. However, as the joint committee looking at the Electoral Act in 1983-84 recommended, there should be a standing committee to review our Electoral Act and look at ways of improving it on the principle of making it easier and more timely for people to be able to vote in an election.</para><para>What we in the Labor Party are about is always ensuring that it is easy for the members of our community to exercise their democratic right—some would say that sacred privilege—to vote. That is a process that, unfortunately, many countries of the world still do not have or do not have in an open and transparent way. That was a major reform of the Hawke Labor government and due credit should be given to Mick Young, the minister, and Dick Klugman who chaired the committee which made all of those recommendations.</para><para>Since that time the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I served on once for a term of government, from 1987 to 1990, has performed that function well. But since this government got into office it has used the process only on the basis of how it can shave the edge off improving the coalition's prospects at election time by the way the act is administered, the way it is changed. The sticky fingers of my colleague Senator Minchin, who in the last period of the government had some interest and responsibilities in this area, are all over this bill in finding ways to give an electoral advantage to the coalition.</para><para>Nick Minchin was the State Director of the Liberal Party in the 1980s while I was State Secretary of the Labor Party in South Australia. During that period we fought out a number of election campaigns. I do not think the partisanship that one brings to helping one's party win an election is the right attitude to have in this parliament—drawing up legislation to try to advantage your party at the expense of democratic principles. That is what this bill is about. It is a crook bill and in a number of areas the opposition is going to move amendments to or oppose the provisions of the bill.</para><para>I want to mention the extraordinary episode of the so-called Greenfields Foundation. If ever there were an example of how the Liberal Party will find a loophole, even a very small one, and try to drive the <inline font-style="italic">Queen Elizabeth</inline> ship through it to their electoral advantage, it is the Greenfields incident. Fortunately, the Electoral Commission is now finding ways to further call on the people involved with the Greenfields operation to disclose where the money came from and how it was raised and to ensure that there is proper transparency. In 1983 the then committee, chaired by Dick Klugman, a member of the other place at the time, under the terms of reference from Mick Young, inquired into two major areas of reform: public funding and disclosure.</para><para>At the time the Liberal Party opposed public funding, but when it came in they never sent the cheque back. They always took the money, though they said that ethically they disagreed with it. If they had some ethics about it, if they believed it was unethical to get public funding, why did they keep accepting the money? Even in the 1984 election Mr Peacock, the then Leader of the Opposition, campaigned to remove this provision of public funding. Of course, he lost the election. The Liberal Party still accepted the money under their entitlement. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Liberal Party to go around questioning issues of public funding but still be willing to accept the cheque.</para><para>Public funding is a very important part of our democratic process. It ensures that political parties get access to reasonable funding to 
 run their election campaigns so that the public have an opportunity to hear all views. It is not just advantaging those political parties that have access to the most money. It was and is a very important reform. But on the disclosure side, it is equally important for people to see who is putting the money up for various political parties. Of course, that was opposed by the Liberal Party. They said that all sorts of terrible things would happen, that intimidation would occur, to those who had been giving money to one party and not to the other. Not one scrap of evidence has anywhere been presented that any organisation which gave more money to one political party than the other has suffered intimidation.</para><para>I stand to be corrected—there might be a case—but I cannot recollect since 1983 or 1984, when the legislation came in, anyone being charged with intimidation or threatening somebody who made a political donation to a political party. The disclosure rules have worked very well. It is published, so that you can see who is putting the money into which party. People can make their own judgment as to whether that party's policies have been duly affected by those donations.</para><para>The Liberal Party has always been embarrassed that it has to rely solely on money from the big end of town, from the big companies, to keep them going. Four or five years ago, at the time of Alexander Downer's leadership of the Liberal Party, the big end of town, the big companies, decided that his leadership was so bad that they told the Liberal Party: `We won't be putting any more money in.' So in a sense they helped in the downfall of Alexander Downer and Mr Howard became leader again of the Liberal Party.</para><para>At that time the debts left in the Liberal Party were substantial. I think the National Australia Bank made a generous facility loan available of $4 million or $5 million to the Liberal Party. Ultimately, they wanted their money back, and how did the Liberal Party do it? They established the Greenfields Foundation whereby, by claiming it is a loan from this company, it does not have to be disclosed. It is absolutely breaking the spirit of the law that we introduced in 1983 and 
 subsequently amended through the 1980s and early 1990s.</para><para>The Liberal Party think they are very smart in finding a loophole. Fortunately, the Electoral Commission appears to be now chasing this down. We will be moving amendments to make the Greenfields example no longer available to any political party, so that the disclosure laws work very well.</para><para>I would also point out about disclosure and about funding the oddity that the Liberal Party often complains that trade unions make donations to the Labor Party but do not make them to the Liberal Party and that this is unfair. Those donations to the Labor Party have been disclosed in the annual accounts of every trade union under the industrial legislation in Australia for many years, long before public disclosure. So they are available to every union member to see where their membership fees are going.</para><para>In South Australia at the moment the Liberal government is trying to outlaw trade unions making such donations. But they are not making any suggestion that you cannot make a donation from a trade union without a specific plebiscite or vote of all the members of the union. They do not want to put that into the provision. However, they are not putting in a provision saying that publicly listed companies have to take a vote of all their shareholders to see whether they should make a donation to a political party.</para><para>BHP, Western Mining Corporation and other companies have publicly disclosed that they are making donations to both sides of politics, usually much more to the Liberal Party than to the Labor Party. I would like to see the chairman of the board at the annual general meeting of such companies move a resolution to the shareholders saying, `I hereby move that we make a donation of half a million dollars to the Liberal Party, $100,000 to the Labor Party, $5,000 to the Democrats and the Greens get nothing,' and a ballot of every one of those hundreds of thousands of shareholders of those companies—and see what happens.</para><para>If the Liberal Party in South Australia was fair dinkum about this proposal they would amend it to include the fact that every share 
 holder in every company has to be consulted before any political donation can be made to any political party. They will not do that, of course. They want to hit the trade unions around the head. The trade unions have always been open about their affiliation and payments to the Labor Party. The Liberal Party want to remove from the shareholders their opportunity to be consulted and have a vote on whether they believe the dividend money paid to them should be paid to political parties.</para><para>I think the issue of disclosure, the Greenfields operation, is a shameful one for the Liberal Party. As I said in my opening remarks, this is a crook bill. It is a disgrace to the process of bipartisanship that we have had over most issues of improvement in the Electoral Act. Many of the other provisions in this bill have only been designed by the Liberal Party because they think they will have the advantage of getting people who they think may not vote for them off the roll and stop them voting.</para><para>It is a disgraceful bill in most of its aspects. We will be moving amendments to a number of areas of the bill and rejecting others.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2040</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I thank senators from the opposition and other parties for their contributions to this debate.</para></talk.start><para>There are areas of agreement in relation to this legislation. Perhaps it is easier to identify those areas where there is not agreement, and deal with the closure of the rolls. In relation to that closure, the AEC is currently embarking on a process of continually updating the rolls. In fact, this issue has been raised with me by a number of people. They say, `You are shortening the period from the issue of the writs to the closure of the rolls. People will have less chance to get on the roll.' The government says that the ideal situation is that you update the rolls continually outside an election period.</para><para>In one exercise—which is a very good one—the AEC has combined with the Victorian Department of Transport to send out notices to those young people who have just obtained a driver's licence. That is a way of 
 reminding young people that they are eligible to get on the roll.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—What about all the other states?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy is perhaps jumping ahead of things, because I was coming to that. The AEC is looking at dealing with this in other states, so that young people will have a chance to get on the roll, and, combined with the updating that I have mentioned, this will ensure that people do not have to embark upon that last minute rush which has been a problem of past times. In fact, the AEC has indicated to me that over 400,000 transactions have taken place during the period of the closure of the rolls.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another area of disagreement is the question of prisoner voting. This recommendation was made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the government believes it is following community opinion in relation to this matter by extending the bar on voting to prisoners in general. At the moment, roughly a third of prisoners cannot vote. That, of course, will be extended by these provisions and will bring us into line with such countries as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium and some of the states of the United States of America.</para><para>Another area of contention is the disclosure levels of donations. We believe as a government that those are important because we do not believe that parties should be reliant solely on public funding. Recently over $3 million was given to One Nation as a result of public funding and a number of Independents received funding due to the percentage of votes they received during the last election.</para><para>We believe that public funding is a good thing. However, political parties should also be given the opportunity to raise their own funds. The levels have not been addressed for seven years and the government believes that it is now time that the thresholds for disclosure should be raised. We do believe as a principle that parties should not rely solely on public funding as a source of revenue. We saw that happen recently in the last election.</para><para>There is also the question of the provisions dealing with the verification of enrolment. I 
 would put to the Senate that, when someone enrols to vote, that is an important process in the community, as important as opening a bank account—in fact, more important. Yet the requirements for verification of enrolment are less than those required for opening a bank account. The government believes that there should be some tightening of provisions in relation to that, but not so as to disfranchise people. We have provided in our regulations, which have been circulated in draft form, for a wide class of people to be able to witness the enrolment.</para><para>There are some ALP amendments that the government agrees with, and we will be coming to those in due course during the committee stage. There are, of course, others that we do not agree with.</para><para>In relation to one aspect which was raised by Senator Hogg, I did take that up with the AEC. Senator Hogg mentioned that his son had made a lodgment and then the process had taken some five days. I am advised by the AEC that, upon lodgment, processing takes place but, because the mail goes out once a week, it may be some days before someone receives notification. That notification is not the substantial registration of that person; registration occurs when the lodgment and processing takes place on the day the form is lodged. In the current situation, with the period for enrolment after the issue of writs, notification can still be received after the time for enrolment has expired.</para><para>What I am saying is that the action of lodgment is really what you have to look at, not so much the notification. Some people think they are not enrolled until they receive notification, so that is perhaps a matter which needs clarification. Other than that, I commend the bill to the Senate. In the committee stage, we can deal with those amendments and the final detail.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2041</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We have a running sheet for this bill.

This memorandum was tabled in the chamber on 15 February this year.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2041</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As indicated on the running sheet, the Democrats wish to oppose schedule 1, items 1 and 2, which relate to the provision of salutation and date of birth information on the electoral roll. As I am sure all senators know, but perhaps not all of the public, the electoral roll is available to all MPs and registered parties already via CD-ROM, so utilising that information and manipulating the data is something that can quite easily be done.</para></talk.start><para>Currently, the information that is made available does not include salutation—which I do not think has been recorded by the Electoral Commission yet—and date of birth. Date of birth is in the Electoral Commission's information but has not been provided to date to MPs or registered political parties. This part of the bill will enable that to happen, so in the information to be made available, which I assume will also be provided as part of the information on the CD-ROM, political parties or MPs will be able to sort data by date of birth and salutation.</para><para>The Democrats have concerns about this in terms of privacy implications. I realise there are other components of the bill that insert and increase penalties for improper commercial usage of this information, but in our view it is not information that should be made available. Like all parties and people involved in politics, we are trying to encourage people to participate in the electoral system, to participate in our system of democracy and to get on the roll. It is a big issue to make sure people even get on the roll. If people are aware that information such as their date of birth will become readily available to a wide range of people, that may serve as a disincentive for them to get on the roll. There are clearly a lot of privacy concerns in the community, and I do not think this section of the legislation will assist.</para><para>Of particular concern is the fact that this information will go to registered political parties. As I indicated in my speech on the second reading debate, there is a long list of bodies that are registered as political parties, many of which are quite obscure and which people know very little about. I for one certainly would not be confident that that information would not be misused.</para><para>For instance, organisations such as One Nation, which is actually structured as a company, would be able to utilise such information. You could see David Oldfield, a well-known casanova, being able to do a sort on his computer to extract all the females who have the salutation of `Miss' and who are under the age of 35 so he could send them a personal invitation. He would be able to do that quite easily with this sort of information, and I think that gives an indication of some of the ways this information could be used which are not commercial. I do not know whether that would come under `misuse' in the bill.</para><para>In terms of the commercial value of this sort of material, it would be immensely valuable for organisations—whether you are talking about organisations that describe themselves as One Nation Ltd or other organisations outside the political sphere that may be able to get hold of this material—to be able to get the details of basically every adult in the Australian community, in terms of their date of birth and marital status, to some extent, or salutation. The sorts of penalties that are proposed by the government, which I know we will get on to in future amendments, could quite easily be absorbed by a commercial operation into its overall cost structure. An $11,000 fine would be a fairly small amount to pay compared with the amount that a commercial operation would be able to extract from using such a list if it was done in a targeted manner.</para><para>For all of those reasons, the Democrats believe that this is not an appropriate measure. It is not appropriate that political parties and parliamentarians should have access to date of birth information. Obviously, it would be beneficial to the Democrats, as to all other MPs, to be able to have access to that infor 
 mation in terms of targeting our message. But we believe we should not have that level of personal information about Australia's citizens.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2042</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with that. The Greens feel very strongly opposed to this amendment which will give all political parties and all politicians not only the list of names on the electoral roll which, in common with every other member of the Australian public, we have access to at the moment but also—unlike the rest of the Australian public—access to two things: first of all, the date of birth of everybody on the electoral roll, and then the salutation. That is whether a person prefers to be called Miss, Ms, Mrs, Mr, Doctor, Professor—whatever it might be.</para></talk.start><para>I understand that this is new. The minister may be able to tell the committee that the salutation will be collected and will be something that people will be required to give when they fill in an application to go on the electoral roll. If that is so, what we are witnessing through this amendment is the electoral office being used to get information that will advantage the political parties. It is not something that the electoral office itself has up until now apparently wanted.</para><para>What you can see here is what so often happens in parliament, and that is the big political parties wanting to change the Electoral Act in a way which gives the incumbents an advantage. Of course, when it comes to the next election or the election after that, this information is going to be available to political parties and politicians, but it is not going to be available, for example, to Independents standing for that election. They are going to be clearly disadvantaged—much the same way as they are currently disadvantaged by the rule which says they must always go at the end of the ballot paper.</para><para>It is another tilting of the balance towards the incumbents when the balance should be struck and, if anything, turned in the other direction, because what Australians are looking for in this day and age is greater diversity, more individualism, more difference in the range of people they can vote for. This is 
 simply another measure to help entrench the big political parties and give them advantage.</para><para>I would ask the minister: to what use can the salutation and date of birth, along with the name of people on the electoral roll, be put by political parties or politicians who get them? Or, conversely, to make it a bit easier: are there any uses which are prohibited under the electoral law? For example, can a political party send out to everybody on the electoral roll a request that that person consider joining the political party? Can they garner a donation? Are they able to invite people to otherwise contribute to the strength and wellbeing of that political party under this amendment in a way that other people are not going to be able to? Where is the line of commercial use? Where is the line of abuse in political parties and politicians getting access to these private details of members in the electorate—access which the Australian people themselves cannot get?</para><para>I believe there is a simple rule here. That is, the information on the electoral roll that is available to political parties and politicians ought to be exactly the same as the information that is available to every other citizen. Parties and party machines should not be getting information that is not available to the very people that information is kept on. As Mr or Mrs Citizen, the average Australian is not going to be able to get this information about the date of birth of their neighbour or how the person down the road prefers to be addressed for their Christmas card. Why should the political parties? It is a self-interested amendment. The Greens totally oppose it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2043</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this amendment, because it flies directly in the face of what the government is proposing. At the moment the AEC collects gender, and that is nothing new. What is proposed here is that the date of birth and salutation be included. It is the view of the government that it is only appropriate to ask people as to the title by which they would like to be addressed. There is no great revelation or no great privacy consideration in that, the government would submit.</para></talk.start><para>There are safeguards in relation to the use of information from the roll and the habitation index. There are penalties involved to ensure that the information is not abused. The current situation allows for medical researchers to make use of the information on the roll, and that is for screening for breast cancer and the like. That is covered by regulation.</para><para>What we are proposing here is to allow for electoral research by political parties. We do not see that is such a problem. It is all part of the democratic process that there be communication between political parties and those who are entitled to vote. We do not see this as breaking down any great walls of privacy, if you like. What we are dealing with is information which people commonly provide: the salutation, a title by which they wish to be addressed; the date of birth; and, as I say, the gender is already there on the record.

Is the minister really trying to convince this committee that the political parties are, in some way or another, paradigms of virtue that will not abuse this system in the way that the wider public would? That statement, in itself, has the government saying that the public does not have the ethical standards that the political parties have. I think you would have a lot of trouble sustaining that argument out in the public arena.</para></talk.start><para>This is a very clear move by the political parties to gain self-advantage. This is not a move to, in some way or another, act in the wider public interest. This is a self-invested move by the government—and the Labor Party is supporting it—to get information on electors: information which is not available to those electors themselves; information about other people not just to consult or do research, as the minister says, but to be able to at least send out information in an attempt to get electors to support those political parties in a way that other people standing for election cannot. And that is wrong.</para><para>There were two other questions. One was whether the Privacy Commissioner was consulted; and, if so, what was the response? And, just going back to the first question I asked of the minister: where are the boundaries of the uses to which this so-called `research' by the political parties can be put? It is not good enough for the minister to say, `Oh, we'll leave that to the Electoral Commission.'</para><para>If you are to have good laws, it is up to this parliament—and, in this case, it is up to those putting forward the amendment—to state explicitly the purposes for which the use of salutations and date of birth of Australians in general can be put by the political parties. It 
 is not to be left vaguely to some arbiter because, as you know, that will lead to abuse. I suppose we will get no further answer out of the minister on that, although I invite further comment about what the government believes is a fair use of this information, and that should be on the record at this juncture in this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2044</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly on that last point, section 4 of the act contains definitions.

Political parties play an essential role in the running of democracy in this country, despite the fact that a lot of people do not think so.

I would say that Senator Brown needs to remember that there is recognition of this fact by public funding in relation to elections.</para><para>Political parties play a very important role, and electoral research is part of that role.

It is really about informing the electors of Australia.</para><para>I reject the notion that political parties are subversive or, in some way, that they are devious in this regard.

The opposition does acknowledge that. We believe, as a result, it is important that there are sufficient penalties for misuse of such information. I think it is important to address that concern. I think the opposition's amendments in relation to increasing penalties does address those concerns. I would commend them to Senator Brown's and Senator Bartlett's consideration.

The information can be used for any purpose in connection with an election or referendum or the performance by the senator or member of his or her functions as a senator or member in relation to the people on the electoral roll. That has no real definition or limitation at all. I suppose by comparison we might say, if we accept that political parties have a special place of honour when it comes to using information about the electorate, information which the electorate itself cannot get, why not give it to the churches? Why not give this information to welfare organisations in the country? Why not give it to ethical organisations so that they might do some research? Are they less worthy of this information than political parties? I think not. Let us be straight about this: this is

The government's proposal in the bill to increase the penalty to 100 units—which is effectively an $11,000 penalty—is a step in the right direction, but I believe that a more severe penalty should be imposed, given the increased access to information on electors and the sensitivity and value of that information. The opposition amendments propose to increase the number of penalty units to 1,000 for disclosure or for using this information for commercial purposes. That would mean it would attract a fine of $110,000, and I think that is more appropriate and would reflect the value of the information that is provided to parliamentarians and those involved in the political process.</para><para>The disclosure of this information to marketing companies could offer an enormous commercial advantage to them, and it is essential that a penalty exist to act as a serious deterrent to any such commercial advantage—in other words: use this information for what it is intended to be used for. The minister has indicated on behalf of the government the sorts of constraints that apply. I think this is an important amendment to ensure that no individual strays beyond those sorts of constraints. We do not think that the government's proposal for 100 penalty units or an $11,000 penalty does that; we believe that the very significant increase to $110,000 would. As a result, I commend the opposition's amendments to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2046</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Faulkner.

Another prisoner who was sentenced to two years in gaol coinciding with a favourable electoral cycle would be able to vote.</para><para>The truth is that parliament has accepted that certain classes of prisoners should not be able to vote. We do not oppose that view that has been expressed by parliament previously. But we say that it is possible to distinguish between major and minor crimes, as has been decided previously by this parliament and a range of state parliaments. That is why we will be opposing measures to abolish mobile polling booths for prisons and postal votes for prisoners, which was the item that we have deferred to a little later in our considerations and deliberations.</para><para>Our amendments will ensure that, if any prisoner has been continually in prison from the return of the writs of the previous elections to the issuing of the writs for the next election, their vote will not be admitted to the count. And we think that this is an improvement to the current act, that it actually provides greater consistency to the five-year rule. We have picked up suggestions, arising from the debate in the House of Representatives, to leave item 29 as it is. Item 29 provides for the controller-general of prisons in each state and territory to forward to the AEC lists of persons who have been convicted and are serving a sentence of imprisonment. To make the opposition's amendment effective the provision of that information is essential.</para><para>Fundamentally, we are saying that, above and beyond the five-year rule, which we believe ought to remain in place, any prisoner who has not been able to be involved at all in the political process from the return of the writs of one election to the issuing of the writs at the next ought not to be entitled to vote because, of course, there has been no capacity for a prisoner in that circumstance—in any sense, or in any way—to participate in the political process.</para><para>This is, I suppose, Mr Temporary Chairman, an amendment that could be described, in one sense, as a minor tightening of the current provisions. Nevertheless, I think it is a balanced approach that the opposition is taking on this issue and I think it strengthens the provision in the current act. I commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2048</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be supporting that amendment but, as the committee and Senator Faulkner will be aware, the Greens not only oppose the amendments which are going to discriminate further against prisoners in Australia—in breach, we believe, of a number of international civil rights covenants—but will move to ensure that all Australian prisoners have the right to vote. 	 Currently the law is that if you are sentenced to five years or more, you cannot vote. Senator Faulkner's amendment is an improvement on that. But the best thing that can be done is to get rid of that provision altogether. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it is up to the courts to put a penalty on a person who infringes against society; it should not be for parliaments to be adding to that penalty. If we were having a move here today to say judges may be able, in their considerations, to deprive some prisoners of votes, then so be it. But this universal imposing of extra penalties above those of the courts is not a good way for us to be going. What other rights will the parliament, generally, take away from prisoners?</para></talk.start><para>There is a very good reason for giving prisoners the vote—that is, we all want to see prisoners out of jails, where they cost a lot of money, and back in society in a rehabilitated form so that they feel part of society and feel they can contribute to society and not go back to prison. Where you deny prisoners the right to vote, you send a clear message to them that they are rejected by society and that they have a right to feel further alienated. The impact of this is to lessen the likelihood of people coming out of prison with a better attitude towards society than when they went in. It is not that we would be alone in this. As I mentioned, there are a number of international covenants which say that every citizen should have a right to vote. The measures 
 being put forward here by the government—to further trammel the right of prisoners to vote—goes against those covenants.</para><para>Around the world, countries which ensure that prisoners do have the right to vote include Cyprus, England, Hungary, Israel, Kenya, Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Norway, Poland and Zimbabwe, as well as five states in the US. I think we are following the pattern of the United States—which is trying to contain the extraordinary levels of crime it has compared to Australia; and the misguided philosophy behind its crowded gaols, which have over a million prisoners these days—where the belief is that, in some way or another, depriving people of civil liberties will teach them something that will help them when they come back into society. The reverse is the case.</para><para>Following a number of peaceful environmental protests, I have found myself for a period of time with prisoners in Tasmanian gaols. They are alert to what is going on in politics. They read the papers. They watch television. They discuss these matters. I think we ought to encourage that, not discourage it. The deprivation of a person's right to vote is a very clear discouragement. As I said, if that is to be a penalty for prisoners, let the courts impose it.</para><para>Senator Ray said in this place the other day when we were talking about these matters that anybody who gets up and tries to improve the lot of prisoners—I am paraphrasing here, but I agree with this sentiment—is going to cop a bucketing out in the community. That does not make it wrong. That is why I will not only be supporting this opposition amendment, which is a fair one, but also be moving, as you know, amendments a little further down the line to ensure that prisoners do have the right to vote in Australia, as they do in many other countries around the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2048</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting this opposition amendment, for reasons similar to those just outlined. We also strongly believe that it is important, except in exceptional circumstances such as treason, et cetera, that prisoners should have the right to vote. We do 
 not believe it serves any useful purpose to deny prisoners that right, particularly in relation to some of the reasons why people end up in gaol these days.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cooney, in his contribution at the second reading stage, pointed out the problems of mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory. Mandatory sentencing also exists in Western Australia. The Democrats are strongly opposed to the mandatory sentencing regimes in those areas and, indeed, anywhere in Australia. The attempt to deprive citizens of their entitlement to vote, we believe, is unfounded and unhelpful in terms of trying to ensure as comprehensive a democratic system as possible.</para><para>It probably would be unreasonable of me to suggest that this may be the government's motivation. I am sure it is not. Nonetheless, it is still appropriate to point out that it would be reasonable to assume that the potential political beneficiaries of such a measure would be conservative parties. I think it would be reasonable to suggest that, demographically speaking, people in prison would be less likely than those in the broader community to vote for conservative parties. Whilst I am not suggesting that is the government's motivation, it nonetheless has that potential effect.</para><para>As with any change to the electoral law, I think it is important to highlight those sorts of issues. As I said in my contribution in the second reading debate, all of us in this place are not just legislators but a prime interest group in relation to the impact of this legislation that deals with electoral law. We need to highlight that up-front and be clear about that.</para><para>There are a number of other amendments that the Democrats and Senator Brown are proposing, as have been indicated on the running sheet, to ensure that prisoners have the right to vote. In relation to Senator Faulkner's amendment, we believe it is an improvement on the bill as it stands at the moment, and we will support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>2049</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is opposing these amendments for a number of reasons. Firstly, the unworkability of this would make the AEC entirely 
 reliant on timely advice from prison authorities following the issue of the writ. The AEC has to deal with not only six states but also two territories in dealing with prison authorities. I also note that there is no proposed amendment to section 109 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Section 109, `Lists of convictions to be forwarded', provides that the Controller-General of Prisons shall forward a list each month to the Australian Electoral Commissioner of the names of those people who have been sentenced to a period of five years or longer. That is the current provision. I note that that has not been amended by the opposition. That is a flaw that would need to be amended as well.</para></talk.start><para>The other thing is that the amendment would be extremely impractical to implement, even with the current seven-day close of rolls period. It would be difficult for the AEC to determine the eligibility of prisoners as this could only be resolved when the date of the issue of the writ is known.</para><para>The other problem you have with the opposition amendment is that it deals with the return of the writs for an election for the House of Representatives or the Senate and it continues to the issuing of the writs for any successful election for the House of Representatives or the Senate. There are different times for those. Whilst the writs of the House of Representatives are returned together, the various writs from the states for the Senate may not all be returned on the same day. That is another administrative aspect which the government has a problem with.</para><para>In total, the government's proposal is a much simpler one in dealing with this issue. This deals with the recommendation made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—that is, that those who disregard the laws to a degree sufficient to warrant imprisonment should not expect the right to retain a franchise. As I say, in any event, there is provision at the moment for those sentenced to a period of five years or over to lose that entitlement. On that basis, the government opposes the opposition's amendment and maintains its proposal as previously stated.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—The question is that the

Some time ago the parliament, as Senator Faulkner has said, decided to take away from prisoners who are sentenced to more than five years in gaol the right to vote. This move means that all prisoners will lose their right to vote. That goes against, as I have said, a series of international covenants. It overrides what I believe is the court's sole prerogative to be giving penalties to people who break the law, and it puts us out of line with a lot of countries around the world in ensuring that prisoners do have the right to vote.</para></talk.start><para>It is also totally unfair, and there is no way that the government is going to fix this up. It means that, if you are in gaol for a relatively minor crime which has involved no physical harm to anybody else, when Mr Howard calls an election you lose your vote. Of course, if you have just finished your sentence—your two months or your one month—and you are out of gaol you keep your vote. If you go to gaol just after the election you keep your vote. If you just happen to be the one who is in gaol when the election is called you lose your vote. It, on the face of it, means that those prisoners who happen to be serving their sentence at, and only at, the time an election is called will be deprived of privileges which prisoners who have just got out of gaol are going to maintain.</para><para>I and other senators have had a very strong letter from the South African communities organising for public safety and for a sensible and effective prison policy, Ms Johnson, saying, `Don't do this.' It is saying that these organisations are horrified to hear that the 
 Prime Minister and the government have put forward this bill with the intention of removing prisoners' right to vote. It says:</para><para>I remember the years we South Africans could rely on Australians to stand up for human rights by supporting the anti-apartheid movement, demonstrating at Springbok rugby and cricket games when racist-minded bureaucrats allowed them to travel to your country. I consider Australia as the progressive country, with its fair share of problems but working to address them in a fair and equitable manner.</para><para>It mentions, by the way:</para><para>I remember—</para><para>says Ms Johnson—</para><para>reading about the ground-breaking prison reform attempts of Mr Tony Vincent in New South Wales, which focused on addressing the real problems of prisons ravaged by riots and institutionalised brutality with rehabilitation, education and empowerment. Mr Vincent was correct when he sought to introduce the humane principle that a prisoner must retain certain inalienable rights if the hopeless cycle of recidivism, that is, going back to crime, is ever to be broken. The right to vote should be an inalienable right for all citizens of all countries.</para><para>This South African correspondent goes on to point out that, of course, by denying prisoners the vote, including prisoners who are sentenced to less than five years, if you look at the statistics, will have an undue effect of depriving indigenous people of the right to vote. Remember that, wholesale, indigenous Australians were not recognised or given that right until just a couple of decades ago. Here we have a move which is going to unfairly discriminate against indigenous Australians for the simple reason that they go to gaol, they get locked up, 10 to 20 times as much as the rest of the population. The reasons for that we all know—the poverty, the dispossession of land, the enforced breakdown and deprival of culture, and so many other things.</para><para>Added on top of this is a disproportionate and I believe racist amendment in its effect in depriving an undue number of indigenous Australians of the right to vote. I totally object to it. The Greens are totally opposed to this. We think this committee chair would do well to listen to the letter from South Africa saying, `Don't do it.' Prisoners, like everybody else, should have the right to vote. It 
 should be an inalienable right. Taking away their right to vote is not going to help with reform, reduction of crime, or improvement of behaviour when prisoners get out of gaol, which ought to be the aim of their time in gaol. I would submit that this is the case, in particular, for people sentenced to gaol for less than five years, who so often have not caused physical harm but have in other ways broken the law—very often over monetary matters. This measure is discriminatory in a number of ways and that is why we oppose these government amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2051</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will be opposing these amendments put forward by the Greens; I think our reasons for so doing were stated adequately previously.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2051</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Effectively, I think Senator Brown is right when he makes the point that the current bill as it stands—if these amendments were not accepted by the committee—would deny all prisoners the right to vote.

That is not quite the intention, as I explained to the committee. It is, as I have described, a moderate strengthening of the provision that goes to those prisoners who have been in gaol from the time of the return of the writs in one election to the issue of the writs for the next. So as I explained in my brief but, I hope, comprehensive speech in support of my amendment, it effectively involves those prisoners who are not able, because they are in gaol for the whole of that period between the return of the writs in one election and the issue of the writs for the next election, to take any part in the political process. That is why, consequently, 
 the words `five years or longer' seem to me to be able to be removed from the act.

It deals with section 109 of the existing act. The bill that we are considering seeks to take out the reference to `five years or longer'. The section deals with the Comptroller-General of Prisons forwarding at the beginning of each month a list of the names, addresses, et cetera, of persons who have been convicted in that state during the previous month, and forwarding those lists to the electoral office. At the moment those lists are only of people 
 who are serving a sentence of five years or longer for any offence. That is what is in the act at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation that we are discussing today seeks to remove the requirement that the list consist of those people serving a sentence of five years or longer, and change it to anybody who is serving a sentence of imprisonment, which is obviously in line with the government's initial intention to deny all prisoners the right to vote.</para><para>Since we now have Senator Faulkner's amendment through, which modifies that to people who are in prison for two elections, the five years is actually fairly incongruous and will not necessarily assist the Electoral Commissioner to accurately determine who is eligible to vote and who is not.</para><para>In that sense, it may actually be better to proceed with what is in the bill which would require a list of everybody who is imprisoned. This will give the Electoral Commission as much information as possible to help them decide who should vote and who should not.

It seems to me, given what we have heard in the debate, we are likely to see the committee not change its view on that particular matter. It was the opposition amendment on which, after further explanation, the final vote did not reflect the will of some senators who had a misunderstanding about the impact of that particular amendment. That would be my view, Mr Temporary Chairman. The minister may have a different one, as may other senators, but I think we can stick with it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—Is it the wish of the committee that we go back to postponed item 29?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2057</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Chairman, it is not a question of recommittal because Senator Bartlett did not move Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 1227 revised 2.

After the committee's revisionism on the opposition's preferred amendment and approach, I think it is important that now this particular amendment be supported so that the provisions in the current act in relation to prisoners, at a minimum, stay. At a later stage Senator Brown may again engage in the debate about progressing his other amendments. But this, though not the preferred approach of the opposition, does maintain the five-year rule in the act. And I think that is important.</para></talk.start><para>I think that is a much better compromise than the government's proposal to remove all entitlements for prisoners to vote and enrol. I would point out to Senator Brown that ensuring that all prisoners, regardless of length of sentence, can participate in the electoral process is a more balanced approach than what the government is proposing, which is to remove all rights for prisoners in relation to voting and enrolment.</para><para>It is not perfect, and obviously the opposition's amendments would have improved the act as it currently stands. But this is the preferable course of action to maintain this provision that not only is current Commonwealth law but, of course, has also found favour in a majority of state and terri 
 tory jurisdictions. So there is also this issue of consistency across the states, territories and the Commonwealth. So I think, in the circumstances and, as I say, after the committee's recent revisionism, Senator Bartlett's amendment is worthy of support and is a principled position to draw the sort of distinction that is appropriate in relation to prisoners' voting rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2058</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Chairman, what is before the chair?

About 80,000 new enrolments occur once the election is called. Closing the rolls so quickly would disenfranchise a huge number of first-time voters. Do not forget that most of these are young people. Even worse, of course, the postponement period for new electors would see all of those 80,000 new voters, who apply to get on the electoral roll when the election is called, disenfranchised.</para><para>When an election is called, there is obviously a rush of people who try and get on the electoral roll. They either apply to get on the electoral roll as first-time voters, or they need an update on their electoral enrolment, such as a change of address. The fact that an election is called obviously motivates people to move quickly in this regard. But we all know about electoral behaviour in Australia. It is often not until an election is actually called that many people take this course of action, that they consider the status of their electoral enrolment. We had evidence given by the AEC to the Senate committee showing that a majority of the 320,000 notify a change of address at the last available opportunity. That is just the way it works.</para><para>It is clear that the restriction of three days for change of address prior to an election is going to be massively distorting and a real impediment to the democratic process. It could lead to anything up to 200,000 people voting at their previous address. That is not what the intention or the spirit of the Electoral Act is about. These are very unreasonable provisions in the bill and we will oppose them in order to retain the integrity of the Electoral Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2061</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will also be opposing 
 these sections of the bill, as outlined in my speech during the second reading debate. I will not go through that whole section of the speech again, but I think it is worth recording once again the Democrats' strong opposition to what the government is attempting to do in this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I realise their purported rationale is to deal with minimising the opportunity for electoral fraud. I suppose if you cut everybody off the roll then you have got a chance of minimising electoral fraud, but you are obviously much more likely to minimise electoral participation. That is something that the Democrats are very concerned about. We do not believe there has been very strong evidence of electoral fraud, but there is certainly very strong evidence about the need for maximum electoral participation if our democratic system is going to have any sort of integrity at all.</para><para>As has been pointed out, this will effectively disenfranchise about 80,000 people and the Democrats believe that it should be strongly opposed because of the hole it will blow in the integrity of our voting system. Clearly, it will impact not solely but, predominantly, on first time voters—on younger people. Again, these are the very people we are trying to encourage to be involved in the political process. It is these very people who, perhaps even more than the rest of the Australian community, wonder whether politics and government and parliament are really worth the bother; and whether or not they should just ignore it all as something that they cannot really do anything about—as some sort of fairly distasteful show that happens down in Canberra that they cannot impact upon.</para><para>All of us, I am sure, want to try to reverse that by whatever means we can. We want to try to encourage younger people to get on the roll to vote, to realise their voice is important, that they can make a difference, that they have a legitimate and crucial part to play in the direction of our democracy and that they have the ability to determine who represents them in the parliament and who forms government.</para><para>This measure is clearly going to reduce the incentive and the opportunity for younger people and first-time voters to be involved in 
 the electoral process. If an election is called, under this measure that the government is proposing, at 6 p.m. on the day of writs being issued, that is it—the guillotine comes down. As Senator Faulkner said, the reality for all of us—not just younger people—is that we tend not to get around to something like fixing up our new address on the roll or on a driver's licence until some specific event comes along which motivates us or pushes us into doing that. For most people, that event is the calling of an election.</para><para>You can imagine the great degree of enthusiasm that young people and potential first-time voters have when they hear an election is called.

That will be the effect, and that is clearly detrimental to the future functioning of our democracy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Chances are they may not even put in an application at that stage to go on the roll for a later election. Their  enthusiasm for the 
 whole process may be such that by the time the next election comes around in two or three years time they will feel even less connected, more disfranchised and less interested than ever. Clearly that is a negative outcome.</para><para>In speaking to the previous amendment I said that a possible effect may have been to benefit the coalition but that I would not suggest that was the motivation. With this particular amendment I feel a little more inclined to suggest that that is probably a strong motivation for the coalition because it will clearly disfranchise predominantly younger people. As all of us know, support for the coalition amongst younger people tends to be less than amongst older people, for whatever reason that may be. For that reason alone, I think it is something that should be pointed out and opposed.</para><para>But more strongly than that, if we are going to amend the electoral system to benefit one party over another, if there is a proper underlying principle, then that will be the outcome. Clearly the underlying effect of this amendment, more than anything else, will be to disfranchise younger people, to destroy even further their faith and interest in the political process. We already have a major problem with that issue in this country, as I am sure we would all admit.

As far as I know, the first Greens legislation ever passed in this country was in 1989 and 1990 in the Tasmanian House of Assembly and it came from Reverend Lance Armstrong, the then member for Bass. The legislation was to protect young voters' rights in the same way we are trying to protect them by opposing this government move here. That was consequent upon an election being called by the then Premier, Mr Gray, on a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon and the rolls closing on the Friday afternoon.

That would only increase their cynicism as well as their sense of frustration about an electoral system that average citizens already feel too cut off from and too divorced from what goes on in their parliaments.

The government's view has been clearly stated in the second reading speech, and I will not go into it in great detail other than to say that the ideal is for there to be a continual updating of the roll. Past experience shows that over 400,000 transactions occur in the period between the issue of the writ and the close of the rolls. This places a great deal of strain on the Australian Electoral Commission. In that rush of transfers and new enrolments, the commission has to verify that indeed those transfers and enrolments are legitimate. The government is concerned that we concentrate more on those activities outside of the election cycle.</para></talk.start><para>As I mentioned earlier, the Electoral Commission has taken up an initiative with the government of Victoria to contact those young people who have just obtained a driver's licence with a view to getting them onto the rolls. This will be pursued with other states. You will see during the course of this year with our referendum that there will be a communications strategy whereby people will be urged to make sure that they update their details on the roll if they have moved or that they get on the roll if they are not on it. That is the ideal situation.</para><para>This legislation allows three working days for anyone to notify change of address after the issue of the writ. That excludes public holidays and weekends. The government believes that is sufficient time for a person 
 who is transferring to lodge that detail. In any event, that transferor is not disfranchised because that person is still entitled to vote in their old electorate.</para><para>With respect to new enrolments, they make up some 80,000 of the in excess of 400,000 transactions I mentioned. We believe our strategies, which we are pursuing, will ensure that young people are not disfranchised but that it will be administratively more efficient to have enrolment on the day of the issue of the writ. For those reasons, the government maintains its initiative in this regard. This was a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.

I am very pleased to see that Senator Ellison and the government are taking action between elections to get on the rolls as many people as possible who are eligible to vote, particularly focusing attention on young people.

 by the Electoral Commission now in respect of the huge number of transactions that take place after the issue of the writs. I believe that we should look to see how these initiatives are going to work out and whether they are going to be successful or not.

I think he is right. He accurately reflects what the spirit of the current provisions in the act are about. If this particular schedule of the bill is agreed to, some 80,000 new enrollees are going to be disfranchised. That means that no new elector can get on the roll once the election has been called and, of the 320,000 people who take the opportunity after an election is called to change their address, a very significant number, probably a couple of hundred thousand, will be voting in electorates in which they do not want to vote. They would actually want to enrol for the electorate in which they currently live.</para></talk.start><para>This really demonstrates the impact of the provisions in the bill and indicates very strongly the breach of the spirit of the way the Electoral Act has operated. Surely we are not about making it hard for Australians to cast their vote in the electorate in which they reside. We ought to be about reasonable provisions with reasonable time frames allowing the democratic process to proceed, understanding the sorts of constraints that the Electoral Commission have to operate under. They are the sorts of issues that Senator Harradine has also dealt with.</para><para>I think this is a real breach of the spirit of the act and the way the electoral process has worked in this country. The provisions in this bill are not provisions that are going to encourage the democratic process. An awful lot of people will either lose the right to vote, or will not vote where they should. We do 
 have a responsibility in this chamber to ensure that the act, which has worked well in this regard, is not changed in a way that will disfranchise so many Australians trying to do the right thing. On this occasion—it is not always the case—I do think that Senator Harradine's comments about the spirit of the act are quite right.

Previously, people were required to reside in their new electorate for a period of one month before being eligible for enrolment in that electorate. They then had 21 days to notify the AEC of their change of enrolment.</para></talk.start><para>These items cut that time back to only four weeks. Of course, there is a much greater concern here with itinerant electors. Item 17 seems to actually eliminate the entire category of itinerant electors. Item 17 provides:</para><para>Subject to subsection (9), a person ceases to be eligible to be treated as an itinerant elector under this section as soon as the person becomes entitled to be enrolled for a Subdivision.</para><para>The thing is that the other items in this group of proposed changes to the act provide that a person becomes entitled to be enrolled for a subdivision immediately, without a waiting period. Of course, then an elector would cease to be treated as an itinerant elector as soon as they moved somewhere.</para><para>We did raise this anomaly during the debate on this bill in the House of Representatives, 
 and I want to record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the response the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration gave on this issue on behalf of the Australian Electoral Commission. He said:</para><para>. . . while the proposed amendments would appear to severely limit an elector's ability to claim itinerant status in the application of the current provisions, the AEC has based the determination of eligibility not solely on the length of residency at a particular address but on whether that address is considered to be a permanent address of the elector—that is, one to which the elector has a fixed intention of returning to live on a permanent basis rather than just a temporary abode for a fixed period of time. The AEC advises that it will continue to adopt this approach in considering applications if the proposed amendments are passed into law.</para><para>That is not good enough, and it is not a sufficient response to what I think is a significant issue, a real problem that the government and the AEC probably would have missed if the opposition actually had not drawn their attention to it.

But it is nine months after the legislation was first introduced. Finally, the regulations have hit my office this morning. I do not know if they have hit other senators' offices. I suppose it is better that they hit your office before the bill is finally dealt with by the Senate than afterwards, so I will give a modicum of credit for that—but only a modicum, I can tell you. It is simply not good enough.

If you were going to be that paranoid and you have got hold of the reins of government and you have a good look at some of these issues, you would be starting to think that a little bit of evidence might come your way if there were any justification for the paranoia itself. Of course, there is not. I think it is paranoia rather than a real desire to improve the integrity of the electoral rolls that is motivating the government in this regard.</para><para>These provisions will lead to an enormous rise in bureaucratic procedures. They will cost the best part of $4 million a year. We think that those sorts of funds would be far better spent on habitation reviews. It is those sentiments that are guiding the opposition's approach in relation to this particular item.</para><para>I suppose we will have an opportunity, given that in 10 minutes the committee will have a break from the laborious examination of this legislation, to look at the draft regulations. I will be able to check when they were 
 actually faxed to my office, at what particular time this morning they actually arrived, given that the government has had nine months to do it. We might be able to have a bit of a look at some of these regulations over the lunch break.</para><para>Frankly, the government has not got its act together on this particular item. I think other senators would share my sentiments in relation to that. That is what will guide the opposition's approach. It is disappointing that the government, which has argued so strenuously that these are such serious matters, has not felt that it is able to involve or consult in any way or provide draft regulations to the opposition or any other senators to advance its case. I think its case is extremely flimsy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2067</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On that point, we have a list of people which is much the same as the list of people who witness passports. That certainly is something which many Australians have. It is not such a bar to people to go through and find someone from a list of that sort. It is not often when we are debating legislation in the parliament that we have the consequential regulations available for consideration, but in this instance the government had to draft these regulations. We have had the intervening election, which taxed the resources of the AEC, and other matters. We had quite an extensive list here that had to be settled.</para></talk.start><para>These regulations are in draft form and they have been circulated. I urge fellow senators from all sides to look at the list because it really is comprehensive. It spans some three pages of people who could witness an enrolment. You have community leaders from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, you have professional people, you have consular people overseas for those Australians who are travelling, you have a number of employees of community groups and women's refuges, part-time and full-time teachers, pilots, a range of people in the area of the judiciary, staff of the Electoral Commission, members of the defence services and people who are involved in Australia Post. You have quite a range of people, even down to ministers of religion within the meaning of 
 the Marriage Act. That really is an expansive list of people who can witness an enrolment.</para><para>The current situation simply provides for any person who is eligible to enrol as a voter. That is a very wide class of person indeed. The government thinks that when you are enrolling it is an important transaction between the individual and the state and that there should be a level of scrutiny at that level of enrolment which recognises that fact. I mentioned earlier that when opening a bank account certain things are required. A much lesser requirement is made of someone who is getting onto the electoral roll. After all, that is a very important thing. It entitles you to exercise a very important right as a citizen of this country. So to have a list of people, albeit an expansive one, is important to ensure that the integrity of the process is maintained. This was recommendation No. 2 of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The government is strongly of the view that there should be this scrutiny.</para><para>I understand that senators have been provided with a copy of these draft regulations. I have other copies here in case anyone wants to have a look. I see that Senator Bartlett would require a copy. I ask senators to have a look at this list. It also deals with the agencies where you can lodge your application for enrolment. That is important, too. It deals with things like the verification of Australian citizenship and the original documentation that is required from a person who wishes to enrol. So these draft regulations are not just dealing with a list of witnesses. There are other matters which have to be dealt with, as well. That, as you can see, was of some detail. I don't know whether Senator Brown has a copy of these regulations.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Only in my office.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—And Senator Harradine as well?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I urge this government proposal on the Senate as being a sensible one, and one which will not act as a bar to any person wishing to get on the roll.

It is the Drug Crisis Public Meeting. I have lent my support to this meeting because it is absolutely vital that we start to find more effective solutions to the drug crisis facing our nation. The meeting tonight will have four themes: the drug problem and its effects; remedies being used today; rehabilitation today; and efforts by governments to combat the drug problem both here and overseas, with special emphasis on the Swedish experience.</para></talk.start><para>A panel of experts will address the issues. We will have Father Chris Riley from the Youth Off the Streets program who will be talking about the problem as it affects youth, and Angela Woods, the mother of Anna Woods, will discuss educating youth to avoid drugs. We will hear about rehabilitation practices here and overseas and the New South Wales shadow minister for health, Jillian Skinner, will release some of the coalition's policy for combating drugs. As yet no state ALP member has agreed to discuss their drug position, but I will get to the Carr government's record on this matter a little later.</para><para>One of the most important issues to be discussed tonight is the concept of custodial rehabilitation. Susan and Allan Forrester, who have spent seven years and $50,000 fighting the heroin addiction of their daughter, will speak tonight as advocates of custodial rehabilitation. Members and senators might recall that in the weekend press both last weekend and the one before they told their story to the whole world, so desperate are they in their fight against drugs. They have seen what drugs have done to their own family and they do not want this to happen to other families.</para><para>The drug crisis as it has spread through the families of the nation has reached epidemic proportions and it is time to consider some new measures. I know from talking to 
 mothers, fathers and families of drug addicts how hard it is for drug users to help themselves. The craving for that one hit is often too strong for any individual to overcome once they have been hooked on drugs.</para><para>I have been told, `If only there was a place where addicts could safely get medical help to overcome their addiction without being able to sign themselves out or get access to drugs.' The current problem is that addicts can leave their rehabilitation program and it only takes one hit to negate all the good work that has been done.</para><para>Custodial rehabilitation for addicts who have been convicted of criminal offences overcomes this problem. When convicted, for example, by a drug court—which has just been established in New South Wales—an arrangement can be made where, for a reduced sentence, and with an agreement to spend the last year of that sentence in custodial rehabilitation, these young people can be put into a drug free environment and get real help. Without drugs and with other support programs, we can actually help them put their lives back together again. Unlike a lot of rehabilitation programs that are currently operating, under this system they cannot sign themselves in and out, and they are not tempted back into their old way of life.</para><para>The current drug programs are not working effectively enough. I am not saying that this new approach is the be-all and end-all by any means. We need a whole range of strategies to help ameliorate the drug crisis. We need to put more resources in at both state and federal levels, and we need a greater range of programs to assist in this process. I have heard from people with personal experience that the way to really help an addict who wants to get clean is to make sure that they cannot get access to the drugs, and then they are given professional support.</para><para>This crisis must be tackled, particularly in the state of the New South Wales which has the worst record. It seems that the Carr government is very slow in moving on this. What they have said as part of their election promise is that they will hold a drug summit after the election. We have the worst record in New South Wales. This state Carr ALP 
 government has now been in power for four years and their solution is to hold a crisis meeting after the election. The crisis is actually happening now and addicts and their families have waited long enough.</para><para>In the report <inline font-style="italic">Drugs, money and governments</inline>, the Carr government was identified as the worst performing state government in dealing with its drug problem. The report found that in New South Wales expenditure on health related programs to deal with drug treatment and rehabilitation actually dropped in 1996-97. The report says:</para><para>It is disappointing to note the very poor performance of the New South Wales government. New South Wales is the largest state and arguably has some of the most significant drug problems, but has failed to prioritise drug problems or make a serious commitment to reducing drug related harm.</para><para>In 1996 half of Australia's heroin overdoses occurred in New South Wales, even though it only accounts for around one-third of the nation's population.</para><para>No-one from the Carr government, not even one of the local Labour MPs—and I have written to all of them—has agreed to come to tonight's meeting or to participate. I suppose we cannot be too surprised about that; they must be very embarrassed about their own government's record on this matter. Meanwhile the opposition health spokesperson, Jillian Skinner, is eager to share what the coalition will do to fight drugs. She will be there tonight and will actually announce part of the drug policy at tonight's meeting.</para><para>At a federal level the coalition government can be very proud of what it has done. It has released the biggest anti-drug strategy in Australia's history with its $290 million Tough on Drugs strategy. This is already making significant progress in fighting the drug crisis. It is a four-pronged approach over four years: firstly, protecting our borders by giving more than $50 million to protect Australia from the international drug trade; secondly, busting the dealers by providing more than $100 million to fight this type of crime; thirdly, funding for schools to educate our children about the dangers of drug abuse; and fourthly, the coalition's policy of zero tolerance of illicit drugs in our schools.</para><para>These approaches are combining to help fight this problem, but probably the most important area we really need to focus on is treatment. At the federal level, we are putting $100 million into this program to assist drug users kick the habit and to provide support for their families. This includes more than $50 million over four years for non-government treatment services.</para><para>The coalition's Tough on Drugs policy is the biggest single anti-drug initiative taken in the country. In addition, the Prime Minister recently announced funding of $60 million for a new youth homelessness early intervention program. The funding will provide almost 100 new services across the country for assistance for young people and their families. These services will be aimed at reducing youth homelessness, as well as supporting young people who may be at risk of youth suicide, drug and alcohol abuse and prolonged unemployment.</para><para>The federal government has been proactive on this issue, but I believe that all governments need to commit more resources to rehabilitation. For this reason, I look forward to tonight's public meeting in Newcastle, where real solutions to the drug crisis will be discussed. I look forward to sharing with the Senate the outcomes of tonight's public meeting.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Honey: Imports and Exports</title><title>Tasmania: Freight Subsidy Schemes</title><page.no>2070</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2070</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In September 1996, nearly 2½ years ago, former Senator Bob Collins asked questions of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee about honey exports to New Zealand. He asked when negotiations with New Zealand had commenced for both the exportation of honey from Australia to that country and the importation of New Zealand honey to Australia. Dr Kahn, a senior AQIS officer, told the Senate committee that we had been importing New Zealand honey for four years. She advised, incorrectly, that some honey from Western Australia was being exported to New Zealand.</para></talk.start><para>However, in a subsequent hearing of that committee, AQIS corrected its earlier evidence. The new answer was that New Zealand had agreed in principle to let our honey in but wanted assurances about areas' freedom from certain diseases on the basis that that would not be an unreasonable request. The hurdle put in place by the New Zealand government frankly did not appear that high at the time. Dr Kahn advised the committee that:</para><para>The information required for exports out of Western Australia is simply surveillance information—</para><para>That sounds innocent enough. She said that her advice from Western Australia was that the state already had data it thought sufficient to satisfy the New Zealanders. She also suggested that it might be possible to establish heat treatment procedures to enable exports of honey from other states.</para><para>In a written answer to the committee from AQIS, the committee was made aware of the full facts of the case. AQIS said that negotiations commenced in 1990 and New Zealand honey producers were given access to our market in 1991. AQIS also advised that it was given draft conditions by New Zealand for access to its market in November 1995. New Zealand also requested further information about heat treatment to eliminate European foul brood as it is called. I asked that same question again on 26 February this year. The answer was basically the same. We continue to allow New Zealand honey to access our markets, but according to Dr Kahn's memory, we still cannot access theirs. That is still dependent on preparation of a case and presentation of data to the New Zealand ministry.</para><para>The honey industry is not the biggest industry in Australia, but it is an important industry. According to the Australian beekeeping industry, particularly in a report prepared for that group at the beginning of last year, the gross value of production for the industry is between $60 million and $65 million a year. It is, however, an important income generator for rural and regional communities, and it is estimated that between 9,000 and 12,000 tonnes of honey are exported per annum. It is not a big number but it is important enough.</para><para>I raise the issue today not only on behalf of the Australian honey industry—who you would understand have become completely frustrated with their failure to be granted access to the New Zealand market; in fact, the information that has been given to me indicates that they have all but given up hope—but also in the wider context of the Howard government's approach to both trade liberalisation and the legitimate domestic industries. Take trade negotiations with New Zealand over honey. New Zealand accessed our market quick smart, but we are still waiting, nearly eight years after our application, to access theirs. Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that it is the view of this government that the Australian honey industry is not big enough to worry about. The tone of the latest answer would appear to confirm that view. In fact, it was quite a jocular answer, as I recall it.</para><para>When Labor was in office, the Australian government did facilitate New Zealand honey's access to our market but, apparently now, according to the government, it is really up to the Australian industry itself to obtain access to the New Zealand market. In the Howard administration, there is an unfortunate parallel between this industry and other intensive rural activities. Their interests are not high on the government's agenda when it comes to assisting them to expand or when it comes to protecting them. In this case, I am talking about the quite legal protection under World Trade Organisation rules if they suffer damage from surging imports.</para><para>Apparently, this government sees industries such as the chicken industry, pork industry and the feedlot industry as expendable and appears to be treating them accordingly. Unfortunately, I must say from the point of view of my state, this theme appears likely in the Howard government's approach in the upcoming budget to a number of industries in Tasmania. At the last federal election there were two federal programs that were the subject of much debate in Tasmania: the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme. The continuation of both of those schemes is vital to industry in Tasmania. 
 Together they provide relief against cost disadvantages faced by many Tasmanian industries and, therefore, they underpin many jobs that rely upon trade and transport across Bass Strait.</para><para>In the lead-up to the federal election, the Howard government committed itself to upgrading the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme to the tune of an additional $15 million a year. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, also committed the government to a continuation of the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme, but gave no commitment as to an adequate level of funding. I pursued the future of both schemes at recent estimates hearings because I was interested in just where the government was on these matters. A senior officer from the department told me that cabinet was yet to consider the recommendations of the Nixon inquiry into the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. He said the actual impact of the review on the scheme would not be known until cabinet actually makes a final decision in the budget context about the acceptance of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme review recommendations.</para><para>The minister responsible for administration of the scheme, Senator Ian Macdonald, gave me an assurance that the additional funding of $15 million was an election commitment. I knew that already, as did many people in Tasmania, from the election campaign. He said the commitment would go into the budget process. We knew that as well. But he could not say what would come out at the other end of that process. Even though he is directly responsible for the TFES, he was unable to say which of the Nixon recommendations might succeed and which might not succeed in the cabinet process.</para><para>Officers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry also confirmed that there is no money for the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme next year—that is, the scheme will literally run out of money on 30 June. That scheme was introduced in 1989 by a Labor government to provide assistance to cover blue water freight, wharfage and unloading costs associated with shipping 
 wheat and other grain, I think, across Bass Strait. It was reviewed in 1993 and 1994 and was extended for a further five years at a rate of $2.7 million a year. Funding was also provided to help meet the costs of upgrading handling and storage capacity in Tasmania. This was based on dollar-for-dollar funding arrangements with the state government. But soon after taking office in March 1996, the Howard government all but gutted the scheme. It removed all infrastructure assistance and cut the actual subsidy to just $1.2 million for a period of three years.</para><para>During the estimates I asked officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry whether the government had reviewed the effectiveness of the scheme. I was told there had been no review. This government has not checked to see whether the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme needs more money or less money. It had not checked to see whether the scheme should be improved in any way. So all of the Tasmanian industries underpinned by that scheme—such as the chicken industry, the pork industry, the stockfeed industry and the baking industry—and the 1,600 workers in those industries whose jobs rely on the scheme will not know until the second week in May whether the scheme—and possibly their jobs—will still be there after June.</para><para>I also asked the government whether it had looked at the possible impact on these industries and the workers who work in them if the Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme is shut down. Surprising to some perhaps the answer was no, there had been no such inquiry. So federal cabinet, apparently, will consider the future of the scheme without any assessment of its effectiveness and without any assessment of the employment consequences of its termination. This will, therefore, be a decision based on politics and not on proper analysis and sensible public policy. Frankly, this is no way to do business.</para><para>Given the importance of these intensive industries to Tasmania and the jobs which they sustain and given the lack of any assessment of the effectiveness or otherwise of the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme, this government has no choice—I say no 
 choice—but to continue its funding beyond 30 June. It is also important that a formal commitment to the future of the scheme be given as a matter of urgency. As I say, people should not have to wait until after the budget to know what their future is. Such a decision, therefore, cannot wait until the second week in May. Those businesses, industries and employees need to know. The government should also as a matter of urgency initiate discussions with the users of the scheme to see where it might be improved. Frankly, if this government is not prepared to undertake these discussions, then perhaps the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee might have to do its job for it.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.06 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>2072</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title><page.no>2072</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2072</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Family and Community Services.

This was not par 
 ticularly directed to my own church; it is frequently the case. I have seen it happen when the Labor Party was in government, and it has not stopped. I have a pretty good impression, for instance, of Anglicare in the provision of services. My portfolio pays quite a lot of money to Anglicare, as well as Centacare and other community organisations, for the provision of services to needy people in our community. It does not mean to say that they are experts on the tax system. In the announcement that was made yesterday by the Anglican media, Anglicare was arguing against a tax on food. Anglicare obviously has not done its homework, because it is crystal clear from the evidence that has been given to the Senate committees by a long list of experts in this area that taxing food is equitable, is simple and is the best way to go for Australia.</para></talk.start><para>We do not want to have small business tied up in knots with great overheads, such as in Britain which has so many exemptions that small business finds it a real burden, we do not want to go that route, because we believe small business has the best chance of helping needy people in Australia get a job, get off welfare dependence and not need the support of the state. That is obviously the best outcome for everybody. I would have thought that the Anglican Church, like other churches and community organisations, would also believe that welfare dependency is not the best option. If you can help people get off welfare and into a job, you are doing them the best service you can.</para><para>If small business is tied up in knots with the exemptions to a complicated indirect tax system, we have done small business no good and we have potentially done no good for those who need jobs. We on this side of the parliament are concerned about the equity of the system too. The evidence that has been given to the Senate committees is quite clear—the expenditure by rich families and poor families is pretty much constant on such basics as food and clothing, it is reasonable to continue to use the CPI as a determinant, and across the board families are treated equally and will not be disadvantaged by the 
 measures. No, none of those families will be worse off.</para><para>The Labor Party can make a lot of noise and has continued to do so, but it is not only the government making these allegations about equity and simplicity but also the most respected tax experts in our country. I think it would be wiser of church bodies and community organisations who do not have the expertise to take careful note of what the experts have given by way of evidence.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2073</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I note your claims about these organisations not having sought any expert information, which confirms that you are not across what the witnesses have been saying to us in our hearings.

Why is it that you would argue against compliance costs for small business but not compliance costs for charities like Anglicare—one of the organisations that has said that this will be a great contributor to the costs of their organisation and therefore make it harder for them to deliver the very services that you say you want?

The tax office has estimated that Australia will have less than half the number of tax administrators as Britain have per capita. Australia will have one tax official per 390 businesses, while Britain has one for every 149 businesses due to the large number of exemptions in the UK especially on food. That is a pretty important piece of information, Senator Crowley, which I am sure you did not have before.

Indeed, something like 50 per cent of the work force is now employed in the small business sector; and, of the 1.2 million new jobs net over the last decade, more than 90 per cent have been in small business. So it is clearly critical to ensure that small business is not handicapped, that it does not have lead in its saddlebags when it is trying to get on with the business of earning a living and employing more Australians. So what would be the consequences if we were to go down this minefield that the Democrats and the Labor Party are advocating? Just look at Canada, for example. This is the sort of nonsense that you get when you try to draw these distinctions, when you try to work out where the boundary lines are. Revenue Canada says:</para></talk.start><para>The federal government is introducing amendments to clarify and simplify the tax treatment of salad sandwiches and other prepared foods.

Gingerbread houses and similar products are generally zero rated and not taxable at 7 or 15 per cent.</para><para>So trying to exempt food would be an absolute nightmare, a legal maze, a quagmire into which small business would sink without any compensation for it. In the UK they have sought to exempt food. What does that mean? You get these inevitable boundary distinctions between `Is it raw, is it processed, is it fro 
 zen?' The rule is that, if sold at the ambient temperature, it is exempt. What happens is that you sell someone a cold pie across the counter so that it is exempt, and then you offer to heat it up for him free of charge. If you go into a milk bar on a very hot day wanting to buy a cold drink, you have to pay more if it is frozen because it then attracts a VAT. So you get all these extraordinary propositions. Confectionary is exempt. How do you define `confectionary'? It is defined as `any item of sweetened prepared food which is normally eaten with the fingers'. So, in other words, presumably a lollipop bar is exempt, but a muesli bar is not.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Schacht interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—I do not know what Senator Schacht eats—probably everything with his fingers.

Here is another classic: standard biscuits include gingerbread men decorated with chocolate, unless it amounts to no more than a couple of dots for eyes. Fruit and vegetable pops are zero rated. So fruit and vegetable, on the face of it, is exempt. But if it is sold as an accompaniment to a hot meal, then it is not. So on it goes. Juice and juice concentrates are at a standard rating, whereas fruit and vegetables are zero rated. Corn chips are zero rated; potato chips are not.	 `What about yoghurt?' I hear you ask. All sizes of yoghurt will be zero rated when supplied in grocery or convenience stores. This includes single servings sold individually, except when supplied in restaurants and other eating or food service establishments for immediate consumption. `Immediate' is another critical word; if it is `delayed' it is different. Supplies of yoghurt made through vending machines and single servings of frozen yoghurt remain subject to the GST. On and on it goes, all in aid of lawyers' picnics, no doubt.

The Australian Council of Social Service have appeared before the Senate select committee on a new tax system. At the committee hearing and in their submission to the committee, ACOSS have recognised that the government's compensation package for people on low incomes exceeds the average increase in the cost of living. That is in line with what the government has said all along since the release of a new tax system. The compensation package of a four per cent increase in all maximum rates of social security, veteran and student pensions and allowances provides a 1.5 per cent real increase in the value of these payments. This 1.5 per cent increase is on top of compensation for the effect of the tax package on the consumer price index.</para></talk.start><para>The ACOSS submission demonstrated that adequate compensation is in the package for age pensioners, couples with children, sole parents, and single and couple recipients of Newstart, and for sickness payments and disability support pension. The ACOSS submission also noted substantial strength in 
 the government's proposals, such as reducing by over 20 per cent effective marginal tax rates for most low income families, maintaining an integrated system of family assistance for working and non-working families, simplifying the system of family income support by combining 12 separate forms of assistance to families into three, substantially increasing the rate of assistance provided to sole parent families and retaining a separate system of payments to assist parents with the cost of child care.</para><para>It is interesting that those who would soon make judgment on this tax reform package are not prepared to listen to what ACOSS has to say about it. It is very pleasing that ACOSS has recognised these elements of the tax reform package. The lessening of poverty traps, which were left to run unchecked during the Labor years, the ones facing low income groups and the greater assistance that is provided to families, are cornerstones of the tax reforms and should, one would have thought, had the unanimous endorsement of all parties in the parliament. But the ALP response to ACOSS was simply one of displeasure and discomfort, because they have backed the wrong horse. Australia needs a new tax system. Australia's families  need it.

I am pleased to be able to say that the tax package will be of considerable benefit to indigenous Australians, particularly those living in remote and isolated areas. In fact, all low income people living in remote areas, whether indigenous or not, will benefit from the government's tax reform 
 package. In developing the package, we have been very careful to ensure that people who are geographically isolated get as much benefit from tax reform as people living in cities and towns. In specific terms, increases in social security payments and income tax cuts are part of a raft of important compensation measures. These measures will ensure that indigenous people on low incomes, income support and CDEP not only are compensated for the impact of the goods and services tax but also share in the gains of the new system.</para></talk.start><para>Social security payments will be increased by 4 per cent to cover an estimated cost of living increase of around 1.9 per cent. Income support benefits will be kept 1.5 per cent higher than they would have been had the normal indexation arrangements applied. In remote areas, where costs can be higher, we have allowed sufficient margin to ensure people are not disadvantaged. Even research by Allen Consulting, commissioned by ATSIC, suggests a cost of living impact of less than four per cent. It also has to be remembered that the indigenous median age is about half that of the wider community. Indigenous families are larger and younger, so they will also receive substantial benefits from increased family allowances.</para><para>While some food items might increase, many will, in fact, be cheaper because of the abolition of wholesale sales tax. The reduction of diesel fuel excise will significantly cut transport costs for heavy vehicles, by up to 19 cents a litre. These savings will be passed on to consumers and will be of particular benefit to people living in remote and isolated areas. I note that the Road Transport Forum and the Northern Territory Road Transport Association agree with that proposition. They say that the reduction in diesel excise costs will result in reduced transport costs. They see benefits flowing on to consumers at the supermarket shelf and the petrol bowser. Community groups and businesses in remote communities will also benefit from a range of new measures. This includes an average 3.2 per cent reduction in operating costs.</para><para>So, Madam President, I have much pleasure in informing Senator Ferris—although she did 
 not particularly need that information because she was aware of it, to a large degree, but I think many people are unaware—of the positive benefits for remote indigenous communities because of the overall nature of the tax package, which will compensate them disproportionately to those in cities. This is because of the demographic factors that are included in the tax package.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Disability Services: Consultation</title><page.no>2080</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2080</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman.

You will recall that prior to the election Warwick Smith was the minister responsible for disability services. He and the state ministers had agreed to meet again late in the year—probably December, but no date was finalised—to discuss this very issue of unmet need. When I was given this expanded portfolio by the Prime Minister in mid-October, it was important for us to put together a portfolio which had a very wide ranging number of responsibilities across child care, disabilities, income support, housing, et cetera. It was not possible for me to meet with the state ministers in December as had been talked about but not scheduled. I then worked with the ministers to set a date, which is the first date that everybody could be present together. From memory, I think 
 that is about 9 April. I think it is an important meeting that we are planning to have.</para></talk.start><para>However, you should understand that in your question you were talking about accommodation and respite services. Those in fact are the responsibilities largely, almost entirely, of the states. The Commonwealth does provide them with a considerable sum of money towards that, but there is divided responsibility, by agreement with the states: the Commonwealth takes responsibility for income support for people with disabilities and employment services for people with disabilities and the states take responsibility for accommodation, respite and support services.</para><para>In that context, as ministers we will be looking across state and Commonwealth governments at how this very difficult problem of unmet need will be met in each of our own areas of responsibility. It would be remiss of me to not point out that this is not something that has just happened. This is something that has been happening over the last 10, 15 or even 20 years. It is not something that will be easily solved; it is something on which governments will have to work together very carefully.</para><para>One of the things I was saying this week in answer to a question about tax reform was very appropriate to this issue: the states will shortly have flowing to them $25 billion of revenue from the GST, which will enable them to improve their services in the disabilities area. This reform is something which many premiers are either publicly or privately saying that they cannot wait to see happen. They need that money. We cannot have states to continue to go cap in hand to Canberra to get money for basic services. That was the system we inherited. Our government has taken the decision to reform the whole of the tax system, including payments to the states. The GST will provide them with an assured revenue stream, which will grow over the years as the population grows and as more people are brought into the tax system compared with those who are now avoiding it.

The government undertook to put that model at a referendum, and we will be doing that in a referendum some time in November this year. The convention also stated that there should be a 
 public education campaign which should be impartial and which should be designed to inform the people of Australia as to the constitution governing the country and its system of government.

Those committees will then apply the $7½ million respectively to a campaign of advertising and information as they see fit to the yes case and no case respectively. I might add that there will be a government process in relation to the approval of that advertising. It will not go to the substance of the advertising but merely to the fact that the advertising is not misrepresentative and that it conforms with the usual guidelines in relation to standards of advertising. It will not be dealing with the substantive matters as to the advertising concerned.</para><para>The third phase will involve the traditional yes and no cases.

 will be provided in a booklet form closer to the referendum.</para><para>It is essential that the people of Australia have a good grasp of the question that is being put them, of the issues at hand, and an understanding of the system of government in this country.

Was it the government's intention that this assessment tool operate to exclude children who are clearly disadvantaged from receiving this payment, and how does the minister intend to ensure that in the future children with a disability are not excluded from this allowance due to inadequate assessment procedures?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2084</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am sure the senator would not expect that the minister would be determining people's eligibility on an individual basis. The social security system has never allowed for that. If a decision of Centrelink is not accepted by the family concerned, they have very important review rights within the Centrelink system and appeal rights to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, the Federal Court and the High Court. So there is no way that family did not have the right of appeal, and it appears they must have succeeded. I recall that was a case last year, but I do not recall the outcome of it. Obviously, though, from the way you describe it, they did use their appeal rights, and it is an indication that the system works fairly.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Renewable Energy</title><page.no>2084</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2084</page.no><name role="metadata">Parer, Sen Warwick</name><name role="display">Senator PARER</name><name.id>KI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin.

The pensioners, the disabled, the people who need our support rely on her to ensure that the GST package is fair and that adequate compensation applies to them. What is perfectly clear is that she does not have a clue how the package impacts on her clients. 
 She does not seem to care and has taken no steps to find out what the impact is on those clients. The most vulnerable in the community rely on her as minister to make sure that they are protected.</para><para>What is clear from the answer she gave today and what was clear at the Senate Community Affairs References Committee hearings is that she does not have a clue and has taken no steps to protect those people. She shows no interest in ensuring that those people are protected and instead relies on trotting out the same glib government line that, `Everyone will be better off. We will have a new tax, but you will all be better off.' The logic of that escapes most Australians, and it certainly escapes me. The minister cannot back it up with any analysis. What she said yesterday in attacking the Anglican Church, because they dared to raise some criticism, was:</para><para>I think it is very sad that those who purport to speak for the poor and the disadvantaged frequently do so with total ignorance.</para><para>That is dead right, minister. And there is no-one more ignorant than you on this issue. You proved today again that you speak with total ignorance about the impact of the GST on the clients of your department—the pensioners, the disabled the other social security recipients. You have no idea. I questioned the department closely at the community affairs committee hearing about their involvement, and the minister today tried to pretend that they had been closely involved. This is what they said in answer to questions I put to them the other day at the community affairs committee inquiry into the GST. I asked:</para><para>So was there any formal DSS involvement in the preparation of the document, the tax package?</para><para>Mr Tune, the Executive Director of the department, replied, `No.' I asked:</para><para>Has the department formally provided advice to the government about the package itself?</para><para>He replied, `No.' I then asked:</para><para>So with the modelling that was done in terms of the tax package, there was no Social Security or Family and Community Services involvement?</para><para>His answer was, `No.' My next question was:</para><para>Has the department done any work on the impact of the tax changes on its clients? 
</para><para>Mr Tune replied:</para><para>No, other than through implementation work that we are putting in place.</para><para>I asked:</para><para>So the department has not provided any views to Treasury about what should be the basis for the assessment of compensation?</para><para>Mr Tune said, `No.' The department has done no work, the department has done no modelling on the impact on its clients. The department was not involved or consulted in the preparation of the tax package. They have got no idea of what it means for housing, for pensioners, for the costs of living of the clients of the department. They do not know whether the compensation package is adequate. They have not done any work on it. The minister does not know whether it is adequate, because she has done no work on it. She has not asked the department to do any work on it. She is not interested in asking. Treasury have said to her that it will all be okay, so it is all okay; we need not worry. The fact that everybody else in the community raises concerns about the disproportionate impact on low income earners in this country does not worry her, does not require any analysis of the problem, any work, to be assured that those people will not be worse off.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—What did you do in 1993?

Labor has refused to admit how the present structure of our tax and social security systems conspires to keep families and people on welfare dependent on benefits, and discourages them from taking up work. It is a commonly held view that the highest marginal tax rates are paid by people at the top end of the income distribution scale. However, the interaction between Labor's income tax and social security systems means that many low and moderate income families keep only a few cents of the additional income they earn. That is what we inherited from Labor. When people on moderate incomes got a few extra dollars in their pay they went out the door backwards, that is, they experienced a reduction in disposable income as their earned income went up.</para></talk.start><para>For example, a single income family with two children faced an effective tax rate of 105 per cent on private income between $27,600 and $29,600 a year. This is the system we inherited from Labor. As soon as people on 
 middle incomes got some extra overtime or were promoted in their job, they went out the door backwards. Those opposite have the hide to come in here and claim that in the tax reform package no notice has been taken of the impact on social security recipients or welfare beneficiaries. That is absolute humbug. That is not the case. Of course the officer in the department will have brought to bear his skills and knowledge. He may not have been representing the department, but his skills and knowledge were there. That is why this system is much fairer and much better. It means that people on middle incomes, when they have an increase in pay, do not go out the door backwards.</para><para>Senator Ian Campbell was absolutely correct: in 1993 the Labor Party put up wholesale sales tax by 10 per cent. I might just remind people that wholesale sales tax went up on strawberry Quik but not on chocolate Quik. Why? Because chocolate Quik doesn't have a tax on it, and strawberry Quik does. That is how ramshackle your wholesale sales tax system was—a tax on strawberry Quik and not on chocolate Quik, on toothbrushes and not on toothpaste. It was a ramshackle, out-of-date tax system which was narrowing and narrowing and had no hope in the future of sustaining or maintaining the social security system. What we have in the tax reform package is some interaction between income tax and welfare benefits and family benefits to ensure that we have a sustainable system into the future.</para><para>To stand here and cry crocodile tears is absolutely outrageous. To say that Senator Newman doesn't know and doesn't care is also outrageous. She is the best social security minister. She is saving $47 million a fortnight in fraud and overpayments in social security, enabling us to give benefits to profoundly disabled children who are in the care of parents and who are under 16. Labor never cared about that. It had families with profoundly disabled children receiving no assistance at all. What was it doing? It was squandering that money, borrowing from overseas, borrowing $10 billion a year to pay for social security fraud, to pay for its incoherent system.</para><para>You stand here and talk about the tax package, the GST. You never talk about it as a tax reform package. You never accept that it is a whole package. You never accept that there is also compensation. The senator who spoke previously said that food is going to go up, that prices are going to go up. Of course we have admitted that there will be an increase in prices, estimated at 1.9 per cent. People will get a four per cent increase on their benefits prior to the GST. If the impact is higher, their benefits will stay 1.5 per cent above the inflation rate. We are compensating them for it.</para><para>So to get up here and cry about the fact that the social security department wasn't represented is absolute nonsense. No social security department was represented when the wholesale sales tax went up. There was no compensation for people who buy all the items that have wholesale sales tax on them, wholesale sales tax that is cascading down. It is outrageous and hypocritical that the Labor Party should get up and make the sorts of claims it is making today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2089</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it very interesting that Senator Newman has gone and left Senator Patterson to defend the government in this debate. It is probably because Senator Patterson is better able to do it, but she has got a dreadful job. Suddenly the government is very loud and very aggressive in its campaign for this GST. It knows that out there in the community people are beginning to understand the impact of this GST on their lives, their income, their capacity to cope. It is anything but a fair tax. Time and time again the witnesses before our GST committee have pointed out that if you are old, if you are poor, if you are disabled, if you are working for a charity or if you depend on charities, you will be badly affected, negatively affected, by the introduction of a GST.</para></talk.start><para>The government's program for the last few days to try to address these serious issues has been to start accusing people like Anglicare, the Anglican Church's service organisation, of being ignorant and unaware of what happens. Who more than Anglicare would know about the impact of the GST on the lives of 
 the many thousands of people they see at the low end of the income scale? That is why they have bothered to write a submission. They have said in their submission that this GST is going to be very damaging. I have here from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, first edition, Wednesday, 17 February 1999, an article that starts:</para><para>The Federal Government's tax reform plans suffered a significant blow with one of the church's most influential church leaders describing the GST on food as inequitable . . . Anglican Archbishop Peter Hollingworth—who played a key role in forcing the former Liberal Leader Dr John Hewson to rewrite his 1992 Fightback package to exclude food—yesterday said a GST compensation package could not be trusted.</para><para>It is much more than that. If you want to start arguing the case in the community about the virtues of the GST why do it by fighting Anglicare? Why do it by fighting the Salvation Army and the Smith Family and St Vincent de Paul? They are to come up tomorrow, are they? Anybody who disagrees with the government is wrong and wicked, according to Senator Newman, or at least they are ignorant.</para><para>We have had other evidence that should give the government considerable pause. Professor McDonald, department head of the demography program, Research School of Social Sciences at the ANU argued before the committee that, according to the household cameos in tax reform, the presence of a child increases the GST inflation of living costs by a mere 30c a week. For example, the GST would increase the living costs of a couple with one child by 30c more than the inflation experienced by a couple with no children. He goes on to say:</para><para>The income tax cuts favour high income, childless households. The double income couple with no children earning $125,000 a year receives a tax cut of $108 a week. A double income couple with one child earning $45,000 benefits by only $13 a week.</para><para>The people in the community know that this is unfair as it is structured.

The Treasury now says it is at least 3.1 per cent. People listening should know that the government has calculated its increase on the CPI, which does not include health costs. Anybody who ever incurs health costs—and thousands of old, sick and young people do—should know that that calculation is not included in the Treasury's figures.</para><para>Finally, Senator Newman has said all the GST money will go to the states to provide services. Anybody in the states in Australia knows that the states are very loath to spend money on services. We have seen so many of those services cut back. Schools in Victoria are an example that springs to mind. Money for home and community services to assist people to stay in their homes and communities has been cut back and cut back. We have no guarantee that the government's GST will give those services to the people in the states. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2090</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Crowley starts off by talking about witnesses who appeared before her GST committee.

They actually assessed that, in their own view, the Treasury's estimate of a 1.9 per cent CPI increase could not possibly be correct. So they urged the government to release the household expenditure survey data, which the government did.

They have no idea because Senator Crowley and Senator Evans have a total focus on that one portion of the tax reform package which talks about a goods and services tax; a broad tax, a tax which for the first time taxes services which is a growing sector, and takes the pressure off the indirect wholesale sales tax which is in a declining sector with a lessening tax base. The only way to maintain an indirect revenue base is to put up the rate, which is what the Labor Party did in 1993 with the wholesale sales tax.</para><para>Do not let Senator Evans and Senator Crowley come into this place and say that we do not understand the impact it will have on low income earners and welfare recipients. We do, and that is why we have made sure that they will be overcompensated. It even allows for a cushion of overcompensation, and this government has said that whatever the CPI effect is—if the modelling is a very small margin out—we will guarantee compensation for that 1.5 per cent above the CPI impact to low income earners and welfare recipients. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2091</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take note of the answers from Senator Newman today, particularly in relation to disability services. The minister started today by actually implying that Anglicare should do their homework when it comes to presenting information before the committees that are looking into the impact of the tax reform package put forward by the government. Her answers today reflect that it is the minister who ought to do her homework. Her answers reflect that she has no heart or feeling when it comes to disability services in this country.</para></talk.start><para>Let us take some of the examples today she referred to, or in fact did not refer to. Warwick Smith, the previous minister, undertook to meet with disability services groups some time last December. That meeting still has not occurred. It would be true to say that this minister has not met with those groups in the 
 community that have responsibility for disability services. For example, ACROD, a peak disabilities group, may be meeting with her department once a month, but the department is not good enough in this instance. They should be meeting with the minister. The fact that the minister has failed to schedule meetings regularly with this group shows a lack of commitment on her behalf to understanding the problems and the complexities of disability services.</para><para>The meeting that was scheduled for last December has now been put off until 9 April, which will be far too late. If these groups are going to have an input on the budget this year, then 9 April will be well and truly too late. The budget is handed down in May, and decisions and commitments will be locked in by 9 April. There is really no commitment by this minister to get a grip on the problems facing disability services in this country.</para><para>We asked a question today about a little boy in the Northern Territory and the fight his family had to gain access to disability services and to qualify for an assessment by Centrelink. It may well be true that that family accessed their appeal rights, but the heart of the matter, which the minister failed to grasp, is that the actual assessment criteria are inadequate. Yes, it is true that ministers should never interfere with decisions by Centrelink, but what this minister fails to understand is that she needs to be across the assessment criteria. She needs to be aware of how inadequate they are. She needs to be aware of where there are problems with the system that need to be addressed.</para><para>This little boy who had his leg amputated below the knee due to an illness was assessed by Centrelink as not having a disability, because the assessment did not require that Centrelink must say that he did. The assessment was not adequate, and it is in the minister's own interest to be aware of these problems within her portfolio. If she attended meetings with ACROD, if she was across the issues in Centrelink and if she was across the assessment criteria, these kinds of heart-wrenching struggles and disappointments faced by families, like the family of this little boy in the Northern Territory, would not have 
 taken so long to be resolved and, in fact, would never have had to occur in the first place.</para><para>Yesterday, we saw an example of another mean-spirited policy by this government. The Howard government is in the process of taking away the child disability allowance from nearly 3,846 children with a disability. No doubt this is to achieve budget savings of nearly $7½ million during this financial year. Parents around Australia have only been given 21 days to reapply for their child disability allowance. That means that they need to fill in a quite complex form. They need to make appointments with specialists. They need to get that referral and all of that information into Centrelink within 21 days. For some parents in capital cities—let alone those in rural and remote Australia—this is just not possible. This is a payment that is worth $75 a fortnight and that helps parents with extra costs associated with caring for a child with a disability.</para><para>Once again, this is simply a backdoor way of taking money from families. It is another indication that this minister has not got a handle on the child disability problems and the disability service problems this country is experiencing. It is another indication that this minister really does not care about what happens to disability services in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2092</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we have seen today has been a shameful and stuttering attack by the opposition on the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman. It peaked in the question that was asked by Senator Gibbs and referred to by Senator Crossin here just a moment ago about the assessment of the disability payment for a boy from the Northern Territory who had leukemia. I would hasten to bet that most of the senators in this chamber have probably never seen the form that a parent or carer would fill in to seek a disability payment for a disabled child. Most of them would probably have never seen the form, yet the Labor Party can come in here and work themselves into a lather of indignation without a proper knowledge of the facts.</para></talk.start><para>The facts are these. The form which has been referred to is in fact an assessment of a 
 person's degree of disability. There are certain categories of people for whom completion of the last part of the form—which is the functional disability test—is not necessary either because of their age or because they have certain categories of disability which automatically qualify them. But anybody who knows anything about disabilities knows that a person can be disabled yet fall into a whole range of possible degrees of impairment. That is why you have to have a functional disability test. Not everybody who is an amputee is going to be disabled in the same way. Not everybody who has an intellectual impairment may be equally intellectually impaired. You might have an intellectual impairment which is very minor and which allows you to function normally in the community, or you may have an intellectual impairment which is profound and requires assistance.</para><para>It would be absurd if we were to say that every person would be treated equally. That would be a failure of our duty to those people who are truly in need. It would be unfair on the taxpayer to support people whose degree of impairment is mild or minor. That is a sensible attitude to take. That is why you have to have a functional disability test.</para><para>Of all the thousands of people who apply and receive disability payments, we get a story of one person whose functional disability test was rejected by Centrelink at first instance. Senator Crossin out of her own mouth said that it would be wrong and it should never happen that a minister interferes with the assessment by Centrelink. Yet Senator Crossin then proceeded to spend the rest of her speech blaming Senator Newman for the fact that Centrelink at first instance rejected the claim, having already said at the start of her speech that it would be wrong for the minister to interfere. If it is wrong for the minister to interfere, how can you expect the minister to take responsibility for an administrative decision, which Senator Crossin by her own admission said should be made by Centrelink? That is the absurdity of the case that we have had from the other side of the chamber.</para><para>What the other side of the chamber gild over and do not want to talk about is the fact 
 that, when this case went to review, the parents of the boy in question received access to the payment they sought. In other words, the system worked. It does not always work perfectly at first instance—no system will—because, if it did, you would not need review criteria, you would not need review procedures. But the system worked.</para><para>What should be condemned is not this minister: what should be condemned is the arrant ignorance of how these matters are dealt with, which exists on the other side of the chamber. What should be condemned is this pathetic attack that we saw today. It took up half of question time; it has taken up half an hour after question time; and still they have not proved one single allegation against this minister. All this has proved is that this opposition is incompetent, this opposition does not know what they are talking about and they should be condemned.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The previous Committee was unable to report on them due to the intervening election. The present Committee considered the evidence assembled by the previous Committee and resolved, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, that further public hearings on the proposed works were not necessary.</para><para>The total cost of the public works covered in the reports is close to 200 million dollars.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies Stage 2 development, Pinjarra Hills, Qld.</inline></para><para>The first report involves the proposed construction of the CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies Stage 2 development at Pinjarra Hills, in Queensland.</para><para>The estimated out turn cost of the proposal when referred to the Committee was 22.3 million dollars.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the works should proceed.</para><para>By way of background, the Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies was established by an agreement between the Queensland Government and the CSIRO to expand and diversify research and development in the mining, energy and related manufacturing industries in Queensland and nationally. The Centre brings together resources from the State Government, universities, CSIRO divisions, Queensland and Australia-wide minerals, energy and manufacturing industries in collaborative activities.</para><para>The proposal examined by the Committee includes the construction of a research building, a technology transfer building, a number of new industrial type buildings, extensions to existing buildings such as the library and canteen, and site works, including 
 new roads, carparking and environmental rehabilitation.</para><para>The Centre was originally designed to cater for research and development projects involving 130 staff. Since the Centre was established, research activities have grown at a rapid rate and existing facilities will be inadequate to support planned increases in research personnel and projects.</para><para>As a consequence, the Committee has concluded that there is a need to provide additional facilities at the Centre to house and support planned increases in personnel and research projects.</para><para>The Committee found that master planning studies of the site, undertaken by the CSIRO, have identified areas suitable for further expansion well into the next century.</para><para>Based on the evidence, the Committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed works will provide for the planned expansion of research and development projects and provide capabilities expected to stimulate their further expansion.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research, Bentley, WA</inline></para><para>The second report which I have tabled involves the construction of another national centre for the CSIRO. This one will be located in the Perth suburb of Bentley and will be known as the CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research.</para><para>The Bentley Centre will provide a focal point for research excellence and collaboration between CSIRO, Cooperative Research Centres, university researchers, Government agencies, resource companies and associated technology suppliers and providers.</para><para>The proposal examined by the Committee involves the construction of laboratories and research facilities, process bays, support and stores areas, staff amenities, public facilities, associated site works, roadworks, carparking, engineering and communication services and landscaping.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was 31.8 million dollars.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the work proceed as proposed.</para><para>By way of background I should mention that the CSIRO, or its predecessor organisations, has had a presence in Western Australia spanning more than 80 years. It now employs more than 400 staff at six locations in the State.</para><para>The proposed work is a recognition of the fact that the mining, oil and gas industries are the mainstay of the Western Australian economy. For this 
 reason, CSIRO and the Western Australian Government have identified the need to increase substantially the State's research capability to support the sustained development of resource industries in an era of heightened international competitiveness.</para><para>The CSIRO divisions involved in the mining, oil and gas industries have established research teams and formed alliances with other research and development partners to undertake projects in Western Australia and nationally.</para><para>Based on the evidence, the Committee has concluded that returns to the community and resource companies from investment in research and technology transfer can be significant and are highly influential in the creation of new investment and employment.</para><para>The Committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed work can be justified as providing modern facilities designed to enable CSIRO Divisions and alliance partners to undertake research into minerals and petroleum research at increased levels and will overcome current unsatisfactory conditions.</para><para>Two other significant factors also emerged from the Committee's inquiry. The first is that co-location of two key CSIRO divisions, Exploration and Mining, and of Petroleum Resources will deliver cost savings and will maximise research effort in support of both oil and mining industry sectors.</para><para>Secondly, the proposed site for the Centre, adjacent to Curtin University of Technology and within Technology Park, Bentley will provide the capability to foster collaborative research between the university and private sector research and development organisations. CSIRO has developed a master plan for the site which makes provision for further expansion of facilities and staff.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Lavarack Barracks Redevelopment Stage 2, Townsville</inline></para><para>The third report which I have tabled involves the second stage of the redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks in Townsville.There are nine major components in the proposed works. These comprise accommodation and messing, operational, logistic support and infrastructure development facilities. The main component consists of new living-in accommodation for 1,112 officers, senior non-commissioned officers and other ranks, associated mess complexes and a central food preparation facility</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was $139.3 million.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the works proceed as proposed. 
</para><para>The Committee has concluded that the provision of new airconditioned living-in accommodation should improve living standards for on-base personnel and should lift the morale of personnel.</para><para>Similarly, the Committee established that there is a need for new messes, on a scale commensurate with requirements identified in Department of Defence planning studies, to be provided at Lavarack Barracks adjacent to the sites proposed for new living-in accommodation.</para><para>The Committee believes there are uncertainties about the appropriateness of the cook-chill method of food preparation based on its untested nature in the Australian Defence Force.</para><para>For this reason, the Committee recommended that the Department of Defence should report back to the Committee on the operation of the cook-chill process after it has been fully tested at Lavarack Barracks, before its wider implementation within the Australian Defence Force.</para><para>The report concludes that the remainder of the works, namely a new Communications Centre, new transport facilities, the Eastern Deployment and Assembly Area, new heavy vehicle roads, and waste collection facilities will all provide substantial improvements to the functionality and environmental management of this, one of the Army's largest bases.</para><para>I commend the reports to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee </title><page.no>2099</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>2099</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2099</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the second report of 1999 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

Obviously, the Senate as a whole is of a view that this is an important matter which does need highlighting.</para></talk.start><para>I rise to speak on this matter of public importance because I believe that the Senate needs to devote some time to this this afternoon. It is a vital issue to the future of native forests  of this country and indeed to the future of our nation overall—our economy as well as our environment.</para><para>Australia is a unique land. Our native forests, in particular, are an ecological wonder. Our forests range from tropical to temperate, from open dry woodland to closed and wet canopy. They are host to a variety of ecosystems, encompassing many of the world's most unique animals and plants. They are found over flat, riverine or escarpment areas from the southern most part of the country to the northern tip. What is particularly extraordinary is the diverse range of forest ecosystems between and within regions. This makes it all the more crucial that we should protect and care for our forests. If properly managed, they could provide a sound economic base for a truly sustainable timber industry and a strong and permanent environmental base for our nation.</para><para>However, successive governments have sold these forests to the woodchip industry. This industry to date has shown little regard for biodiversity, little regard for the diverse range of ecosystems—animals, plants and genetic base—and little regard for the interdependence of all these. It has little regard for water 
 quality issues or other users of forest areas other than woodchippers. The woodchipping industry does have a high regard for getting the maximum amount of corporate welfare from state and federal governments and views the chopping and shredding of the maximum number of forest areas very warmly.</para><para>When the evidence about this industry started to become well known in the public arena around five years ago, the  media took a considerable amount of interest and, to their credit, published a lot of information on various forest issues, including economic and biological arguments as well as the basic environmental aspects of the issue. This certainly scared the industry and governments who, when their actions were exposed, were left able to do little more than defend the indefensible.</para><para>It was a time of full-blown crisis for the industry and, somewhere out of the public relations and damage control spin, the Regional Forest Agreement process was born. This meant that—instead of the industry each year having to face another public relations disaster as a new round of export licences were approved, instead of continual revelations about the appalling process used to determine those licences, instead of all that—we would have a Regional Forest Agreement which would be signed for each general logging area and which would allegedly meet competing demands and allegedly be ecologically sustainable.</para><para>However, the process that we have seen so far has been characterised by a lack of transparency, by bureaucratic obfuscation and by allowing much more woodchipping than previously occurred—so much so that even industry groups are alarmed by the destruction of many areas of significance and its potential impact on long-term ecological sustainability as well as environmental sustainability. Time prevents me from listing all of the problems with the Regional Forest Agreements so far. I am sure there will be other senators who will add to that body of knowledge, but I would like to highlight a few examples which go to demonstrate why this is a matter of such public importance.</para><para>In Tasmania the Regional Forest Agreement, as it currently stands, will remove 39,000 hectares of provisional coupes from the register and then add 40,000 hectares more. In other words, another 1,000 hectares will be available for logging. The state undertook to publish, by 31 October last year, a description of the methods of calculating sustainable yield. This has not occurred. They have also not published, nor made publicly available, compliance audits of the Forest Practices Act or the code of reserve management. Nor have they developed and implemented a threatened species protection strategy.</para><para>In the East Gippsland area of Victoria, certain data on wood, which it is claimed is publicly available, is not provided at all by forest agencies and there are regular attempts to make the process as difficult as possible for people seeking information. These sorts of petty impediments distract from the real tragedy and the real area of great concern—that forests along the banks of heritage-listed rivers will be decimated, leading to shocking water quality consequences.</para><para>In Western Australia the process is so bad that the environment minister has promised, after the RFA is finished, that there will be further changes. Clearly, the RFA there will not be the last word, as was promised. More than 30,000 people sent in submissions to that process, yet the environment minister will not allow the release of the audit into those submissions until after the RFA has been signed. What exactly is being hidden? Perhaps the fact that 80 per cent of people in the state of Western Australia want no native forest logging and no woodchipping. Even the National Party in that state, and some Liberal Party branches, are expressing extreme disquiet with relation to government policy on RFAs, because the Western Australia forest process is in such a mess. The department which, at state level, is in charge of the negotiations in the RFA process—the Department of Conservation and Land Management—clearly has a vested financial interest in the outcome. The department has a clear interest in ensuring the maximum area is available to loggers.</para><para>The forthcoming Regional Forest Agreement legislation that is being considered in this parliament is a small bill of only a few pages, but it represents one of the biggest environmental issues to come before the Senate. It is an issue that most Australians feel very strongly about.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: in view of the fact that this legislation is before the parliament currently and there was a reference to the committee that I chair, I believe it is outside of standing orders to be making reference to that legislation or, in fact, be dealing with any issues pertaining to anything that might come out of the committee's report. I would like a clear ruling on that at the start of this debate.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>—I do not uphold your point of order for two reasons. Firstly, there is a general debate before the chair on the issue of RFAs and forests. Senator Bartlett is clearly addressing that. Secondly, I understand the President would not have approved the MPI if it had been contrary to standing orders. Her advice is that it is appropriately before the chair and, consequently, Senator Bartlett is in order.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—I therefore want to ask a question with regard to this issue.

That is why it is such a major environmental issue which this parliament obviously needs to consider, and consider very deeply. It is an issue that most Australians feel very strongly about and it deserves clearer and stronger highlighting and more thorough consideration—because the bill itself, as part of the overall Regional Forest Agreement process, is an attempt by the Commonwealth to abrogate its responsibility for forests back to the states.</para><para>Forest agreements are being put together at state level in those states that have vested short-term economic dependence on woodchip royalties. We have a system where so much public money is given to the native forest industry in government subsidies that it makes the plantation industry almost untenable. That is what is at risk of being enshrined. The bill will force massive job losses to occur in the timber industry, particularly in the small sawmilling sector, and will be responsible for an unprecedented level of native forest destruction.</para><para>Important safeguards that have been put in place by this parliament over many years, such as the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the World Heritage Act and export controls, will not apply to vast regions of our most important forest areas under what is being proposed by the government. That is made doubly horrifying because of the sorts of agreements that have been agreed to already at state level and those agreements that are yet to be reached in other states. Those important safeguards that this parliament has seen fit to put in place to protect our environmental heritage will be voided for 20 years. This legislation upholds a process which is fatally 
 flawed, and it will destroy rather than protect our native forest areas.</para><para>The Democrats are determined to ensure that the public are made aware of the major threats posed to the survival of our forests by the Regional Forest Agreement process as it stands at present, because it is such a crucial issue to the very survival of our forests and the survival of communities and economies that depend upon those forests and on the long-term survival of a massive amount of biodiversity and genetic diversity in species which are also dependent on those forests. Those are all at risk now in this country. The Democrats believe it is crucial that that risk is highlighted to the Australian people and as much effort brought to bear to prevent the calamity that is before us from occurring.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2102</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance before us to hopefully put a few myths to bed. One of the interesting things about this debate is the endeavour by those opposite to try to shift the goal posts in regard to what was determined in the national forest policy statement and subsequent regional forest agreements.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is most inappropriate that we are debating this here today when the legislation is before us and a Senate inquiry will be making recommendations in a report to be tabled in this parliament. In particular, I would say to Senator Bartlett that I think he has compromised his colleague Senator Woodley to an unacceptable and unfair degree. I think he should think very hard about bringing these types of debates on when the Senate inquiry is yet to report to the parliament.</para><para>Having said that, I want to deal with some of the problems. I got in touch with the clerks to find out what I could and could not use. A quote from Mr Pearce, who gave evidence to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, sums up the position of those people who want to keep shifting the goal posts and who do not accept Australia's responsibility. In answer to a question from Senator Brown, he said:</para><para>He does not like the answer he is getting. The point is there has been a long movement over this issue 
 of sustainability. I have noticed that when people like yourselves who argued for sustainable development 20 years ago discovered that in fact you can have a sustainable development arrangement in the forests whereby the needs of the environment are looked for and the forests are harvested on a sustainable basis, you have jumped ship on sustainable development and started trying to develop other definitions which mean, in effect, sustainable ecology, that you cannot do these things. You have done that, Senator, because you have discovered over time that the sustainable development thing which you argued for 10 or 15 years ago did not produce what you want, which is no industry at all in a good many areas of Australia. Although you are here arguing that about the forests today, you will be in other committees arguing about other industries in other areas of Australia on other occasions.</para><para>My definition of these things is that you strike a balance between all of the needs of our people, and they do require large areas of untouched natural forest, on your definition and mine, put aside and safeguarded for all generations in the future. I agree with that and our industry agrees with that, and it is the striking of the balance which is important there. But our people also need jobs and our people use timber and paper and timber products. They use more than they produce.</para><para>I repeat: they use more than they produce. He goes on:</para><para>Senator, and people in Australia who argue for the proposition that we should not touch our own forests but continue to use wood and paper products in the way that we are are simply arguing for ripping off other people's forests, and that is not a position which I believe is morally sustainable.</para><para>I think that is the crux of or one of the key issues in this debate. I wish to make the point that currently Australia is using 14 million cubic metres of our own timber a year and importing seven million cubic metres. Approximately a third of the timber we use for things such as the paper I am reading from, the pads I am writing on, et cetera, is imported from another country. I find that an untenable position.</para><para>I want to make a few points. Once the RFA is signed, the forest management plan will be prepared. The plan will be released for public comment and full assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority. You hear in debate from the other side that once the RFA is signed that is the end of the matter; it is not. Why don't we get told occasionally that 
 once an RFA is signed the states have to report to the Commonwealth minister? They have to report every year. These are the facts that need to be put on the table.</para><para>Further to this assessment, the EPA will be involved in two processes to ensure sustainable wood production. First, it will participate in an expert panel to verify the level of wood yield before the RFA is signed. Second, it will be represented on a task force to assess forest management and timber harvest levels before the next forest management plan is commenced. Once again, that absolutely destroys the oft repeated lie that the process is left uncontrolled.</para><para>Moving to the regional forest agreements, there are many stages involved in this. The first and one of more important stages is the Commonwealth-state agreement on deferred forest areas. The second state is a formal Commonwealth-state scoping agreement. The third stage is a CRA, a comprehensive regional assessment. The fourth stage is public consultation. The final stage is negotiation of a formal Regional Forest Agreement to be signed by the Commonwealth and appropriate state governments.</para><para>Some of the most important evidence that was given to the committee—and we do not have time to consider it today but I refer senators to it—was from the Deputy Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, when he put a few things in perspective.</para><para>Western Australia gets a lot of mentions in this matter because of the current situation. We have what I consider to be a very unfair campaign, and it is being run on emotion and not on facts from the consultation process that has gone on and the various reports that have been done. I place on the public record that 39 reports have been released to the public since it started in Western Australia. Currently, another eight reports are being prepared and are to be released, I understand, in due course. That is a total of 47. This process has been inquired into to an extent that no other industry has been—whether it be on environmental, tourist or forest aspects or on the matter of shutting up land for wilderness protection. </para><para>You may not like the outcomes, but to claim that there has not been a process of public consultation on forest management in Western Australia is just plain dishonest. I will run through some examples of the process: 1982, EPA review of karri forest; 1987, regional forest management plans; 1990, resources assessment inquiry; 1991, review of ecologically sustainable development; 1991, National Forest Policy Statement; 1992, draft forest management plan; 1993, appeals committee review of forest management plans; 1995, deferred forest assessment process with 500 public submissions.</para><para>The list continues: 1997, eight public meetings in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997-98, 122 meetings with organisations; 1996-98, nine meetings of Stakeholder Reference Group; 1996-97, five meetings with Noongar Action Group; 1997, nine public open days in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997, 10 public open days in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997, 10 community heritage workshops in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997-98, seven indigenous workshops throughout the south-west; 1997-98, 195 meetings with organisations; 1998, the inquiry which produced 30,000 public submissions. I think that accurately puts on the table the processes that have gone on in Western Australia.</para><para>This has not been something that has been restricted to this side of politics. When Labor governments were in power in Western Australia and in other states, they were part of the process—including the governments of Brian Burke, Carmen Lawrence, Peter Dowding. Richard Court's government has been involved and, prior to all of these, so was the government of the final days of Sir Charles Court and that of Mr O'Connor when he was Premier of Western Australia. So this process has been ongoing. I think it is about time people focused on the truth when they selectively criticise the process of the RFAs. I will leave it to my colleagues to deal with the others.</para><para>In the time remaining I quote Carmen Lawrence in 1990 when she was Premier. She said: </para><para>One of the major achievements of the final Management Plans was the identification of areas to be included in conservation reserves. While creation of all of the reserves is still continuing, all areas identified for reservation are being managed for that purpose in the interim. When the reserve system has been completed there will have been a 340 per cent increase in the conservation estate of the South west that is an increase of some 550,000 hectares. Many of the reserves, such as the Shannon river basin, have been made into national parks.</para><para>That process has been going on in Western Australia for a long time. Finally, I quote Carmen Lawrence again:</para><para>. . . it is far better to use timber from well managed Australian forests, where every tree cut is regrown, than to lock up our own forests while plundering the forests of developing countries.</para><para>I put to the Senate that Democrats Senator Bartlett's matter of public importance, if ever implemented, will result in the plundering of other nations' forests. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2104</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset I also want to express a concern about the fact that Senator Bartlett has raised this matter today. He may believe this is a matter of public importance, and no doubt this issue is, but Senator Bartlett is well aware, having attended at least for a short time the hearings of the Senate rural and regional affairs committee, that we have just completed three sessions of public inquiry. We have taken evidence on these very issues, and the committee is at this very time in the process of finalising its report to be tabled next week before the legislation is brought back into this Senate in the following week. I would have thought that in those circumstances Senator Bartlett may have held his fire a bit and enabled that process to be completed and then, if he wanted to address these issues, he could have done so through the debate on the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I also note that Senator Bartlett, having made his short address, has left the chamber. I have always taken the view when I have been involved in proposing a matter of public importance in this Senate that as a matter of courtesy the proposer should be prepared to sit and listen to the arguments put by other senators. I know senators have other commitments, but I believe that that course is appro 
 priate, particularly if you put forward the proposition as being one of such major public importance.</para><para>The next point I wish to make is that we do not accept the statement within the matter of public importance, namely, `the failure of the Regional Forests Agreement process to protect the remaining native forests of Australia.' Our view, which has been put on the record in the other place by the shadow minister, Mr Ferguson—and I do not want to transgress the standing orders by canvassing some of the issues that will arise when we debate the bill—is that the Regional Forest Agreement process is an appropriate process and is a process that by and large is working. That is not to say that there are not some problems. But the problems, in our view, are not necessarily problems with the rules that are set down within the process that is to be followed. Rather, it would appear from at least some of the evidence that has been presented to our committee that the problems are in the attitudes that are being adopted by various parties. It is a bit like a football game. If the teams are not playing the game properly, you do not turn around and blame the rules of the game.</para><para>In our view the Regional Forest Agreement process is the appropriate way forward. In order to appreciate the process we have to at least look at some of the background of how this process developed. Every member of this Senate—indeed, including those who were not here at the time—remembers the divisiveness, the bitterness, surrounding the forest industry debates, particularly in 1995 when this parliament was blockaded for the opening week or two of the parliament. That was the culmination of this divisiveness, this aggravation, this hostility that existed in respect of the management of Australia's forests for a number of years prior.</para><para>We had, on one hand, those who believed that native forests should never be logged. We had on the other side—I suppose, at the other end of the spectrum—some representatives of the timber industry who believed that it should be open slather and that you should be able to export as many woodchips as you liked. </para><para>In order to overcome the impasse that existed as a result of the legitimate interests of conservationists and industry and also to overcome the myriad of constitutional problems—where, on the one hand, it is the states that own and manage the resource but it is the federal parliament, the federal government, that has increasingly used its powers to regulate forest management—we established, under the then Labor government, the RFA process. Of course the genesis of that process was the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, a statement that ultimately was adopted by the current federal government, the Howard Liberal-National Party government. Therefore, it has bipartisan support at the federal level. It is also a statement and, subsequently, a process which has been adopted by every state government in this country. I will come back that process in the moment.</para><para>I want to take issue, particularly, with a statement Senator Bartlett made in his address that there should be no logging in native forests. What disturbs me is this approach that is adopted by Senator Bartlett and certainly by some interested groups involved in this debate that the only solution is their solution, and their solution is `no logging in native forests'. That is an attitude that is contrary to the National Forest Policy Statement and quite contrary to the RFA process, because, whilst the statement and the process recognise the fundamental importance of conservation values, of protecting of our native forests, particularly our old-growth forests, it also recognises that there is a place for forestry use on a commercial basis. Right through the statement you will see references to that because the statement is about a balance. It states:</para><para>The objectives and policy initiatives are underpinned by the following agreed approaches to forest management.</para><para>That includes:</para><para>. . . commercial uses of forests, including wood production, that are based on ecologically sustainable practises are appropriate and desirable activities.</para><para>It also states:</para><para>The governments also acknowledge that a variety of uses of public native forests is desirable, provid 
 ed those uses comply with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. The objective here is the management of public native forest so as to retain the full suite of forest values over time. The governments acknowledge, however, that some uses, including non-commercial uses, may inevitably compromise other values, such as tourism and recreation values, at least in the short term.</para><para>Further on in the statement in section 4(2), dealing with wood production and industry development, it states:</para><para>Sustainable economic use of native forests and plantations is one of the principal objectives of this statement. Wood production is a major commercial use of Australia's forests. It can be integrated with a range of other commercial and non-commercial uses, among them nature conservation, recreation, tourism and water catchment production. Ecologically sustainable management of native forests for wood production involves maintaining a permanent native forest estate while balancing these uses.</para><para>And I could go on. It is a very detailed statement, as honourable senators know. The point is that some people just do not accept that the principles that underpin the National Forest Policy Statement and the RFA process involve both recognition of conservation values and the application of resource security for the timber industry. Until they understand that, they are not going to come to this debate with clean hands, with an objective approach.</para><para>In his address, Senator Bartlett briefly canvassed some of the evidence that was put to the committee. There was, of course, evidence put to the committee which submitted that the RFA process has not been carried out appropriately in some states. That has also been put on the public record. There is currently a major debate going on within the Western Australian government about whether or not the RFA negotiated in that state is appropriate, whether or not the assessments have been properly made. There is also some debate with respect to the RFAs that have been negotiated and signed in Victoria.</para><para>I believe the central problem at the moment is the politicisation of this process by the current federal Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey. It seems that ever since Mr Tuckey was appointed to this portfolio following the last election we have had nothing but trouble and a reversion back to the bad old days when people were at each 
 other's throats in respect of this industry. Mr Tuckey, for blatant political reasons, has attacked the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has negotiated one of the best, most environmentally friendly agreements on regional forest management ever in this country. The New South Wales government under Bob Carr has the most enviable record in terms of protecting our national estate, our national heritage, our environment and, particularly, our native forests.</para><para>Since the Carr government came to office it has declared a total of 151 new national parks and nature reserves, exceeding its original election commitment by more than 600 per cent. It has recently announced the most comprehensive forest decision in the state's history, with some 380,000 hectares of North Coast forests reserved. At the same time, it has also delivered unprecedented security to the timber industry and its workers; a package that has been endorsed by the industry, by conservation groups and, indeed, supported by the coalition parties in the New South Wales parliament.</para><para>But what has occurred at the federal level? Mr Tuckey, for blatant political purposes, refuses to provide the funding that is required under the agreement for exit assistance because he wants to play politics. He wants to play politics even with his own ideological colleagues in Western Australia on this issue. That is not the way to deal with this very important issue. The way to deal with it is for the parties in all of the states to get back to the principles that underpin the RFA process, that is, achieving both ecologically sustainable development and resource security, hand in hand with conservation of our great national heritage. It should be done under the process that was established and supported by all state and federal governments of both political persuasions. That is the way forward. We believe the process is working. There are some issues that need to be addressed. I have got no doubt that we will be able to deal with those when the legislation comes before the parliament soon. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2106</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel somewhat frustrated because there is 
 only three minutes allocated to me to speak on this matter. I am also angry because we are seeing a process in this parliament whereby, without the knowledge of most Australians, we are facing legislation within two weeks which will hand across millions of hectares of what is left of the wild forests in this great nation of ours to the woodchippers. That is called the regional forest agreement. Behind that name is the lie that it has the support of the Australian people. Every opinion poll shows that that is not the case. It has the support of the big logging corporations, in particular the export woodchip corporations, and through them I submit it has the support of the major political parties.</para></talk.start><para>The problem here is that we do not have an adequate debate, with an opposition on one side and a government on the other. Both the political parties are lining up to push through this legislation in the interests of those logging corporations against the 80 per cent of Australians who do not want this continuing and unnecessary destruction of not only the great wild forests that are left in this country but also the wildlife in them.</para><para>I have in my hands a picture which you cannot see, Mr Acting Deputy President, but which I can. When we look at that picture, which is in the rainforests of the Tarkine Wilderness in Tasmania where clear-felling takes place, what we see is a whole mountainside in flames where once the rainforest stood. It has been scalped. Every blade, every leaf, every living animal, every living entity in that forest has been totally and utterly destroyed. Members come in here and say that this is ecologically sustainable.</para><para>On the committee evidence that earlier members have averred, when I have asked representatives of the logging industry—not least the Deputy Premier of Tasmania—what a natural forest ecosystem is, with one exception, they have totally failed to provide an answer. When you ask, `What does sustainable mean?' again they cannot answer—or they won't. To be honest about it, you cannot be cutting, firebombing and then poisoning these forests to kill any grazing animals that come into them after they have been destroyed and call that ecologically sustainable. 
 That is a lie. Anybody in the street can tell you that that is a fabrication. Yet that lie is going to be incorporated into action for far more extensive destruction of these forests and the wildlife that goes with them, including world heritage value forests in this great country of ours under this legislation which has had far from adequate exposure to the public.</para><para>In Western Australia in particular at the moment the debate is raging. The opinion polls show that a growing proportion of people are horrified by the potential for legislation to lock up these forests. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2107</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to reiterate what has been said by a couple of earlier speakers about the matter coming forward today when the bill is being debated. I am sure that both Senator Bartlett and, no doubt, Senator Brown will have plenty of opportunity to put their views on the table. I must say, although Senator Brown complains about the amount of time he has had here today, I think our chairman, Senator Crane, has been more than patient with Senator Brown at the three days of committee hearings; he has given him a lot more time than permanent members.</para></talk.start><para>In any event, I do not think Senator Brown will ever agree with any process we come up with in this place. The track record goes back some 10 years. With any opportunity that has been put forward by whatever government happens to be in power federally or in the state, Senator Brown and his friends in the green movement pay lip-service initially and, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, then walk away from the process. I really query why the Democrats want to derail a process which is guaranteeing the protection of potentially vast amounts of Tasmanian wilderness and old growth forests and replace it with increased exploitation of wilderness and old growth forests in other countries.</para><para>I would be the first to admit that the issues surrounding the best conservation use of Tasmania's forests—and in this case I would like to refer to Tasmania because it has completed an RFA and, therefore, I think it is 
 appropriate to tell the chamber what has happened there—are both complex and difficult. One of the main difficulties that arises is ensuring that the economical harvesting of timber can continue to be carried out in a manner which does not threaten fragile ecosystems, particularly where they are unique; that future generations are able to continue to appreciate existing natural wilderness and that harvesting does not occur at a rate which is unsustainable in the long term. I believe the RFA process was commenced to ensure that these and other difficulties are overcome.</para><para>It is worth looking at the objectives of the RFA process. They come as a result of the national forest policy statement that the Federal Labor Party put down. They come, in Tasmania's case, after 28 or so inquiries over a period of 10 or more years, when a lot of emotional debate has gone on and a lot of small industries in Tasmania have gone to the wall. A lot of jobs have been lost, and further jobs will be lost if we cannot collectively come up with a process that meets the objectives.</para><para>The objectives of the RFA process included social, economic, environmental and heritage objectives. I will outline what they were. They were to manage the forests for a potentially expanding and value adding industry. It is very important that we have that value adding industry because it provides jobs for the people of Tasmania, and we certainly need them at the moment. They were to provide for sustainable high value species timbers, to maximise areas available for intensive management, to protect a comprehensive, adequate and representative sample of forest biodiversity, commonly known as the CAR reserves, to protect vulnerable, rare and endangered forest ecosystem biodiversity and to protect wilderness and old growth forests.</para><para>The final outcome as recommended in the agreement signed between the federal and Tasmanian governments has delivered outcomes which meet all these objectives—far beyond recognised national and international best practice reservation standards. For example, under the RFA, 40 per cent of Tasman 
 ia's land area will be classified as reserves, including 39 per cent of Tasmania's forests, 68 per cent of the old growth forests and 95 per cent of all wilderness. These percentages far exceed the JANIS guidelines set as goals at the commencement of the process.</para><para>The new Tasmanian Labor government is a very strong supporter of the RFA outcomes for Tasmania. The Deputy Premier himself came to Melbourne to give evidence and strongly support the Commonwealth RFA legislation. Since the process was started by the Keating Labor government I am surprised that some of my Tasmanian Labor colleagues have not been more vocal in their support for the process—not Senator O'Brien, I must admit, nor you, Senator Sherry. But for some reason one or two others have been rather quiet.</para><para>After all, the RFA is expected to have many benefits for Tasmania, for its people and for the protection of its forests. Those benefits include the development and launch of a widely supported forest industry growth plan, a significant increase in plantation establishment, hundreds of new jobs to be created, resource security resulting in millions of dollars being invested in Tasmania, guaranteed quality of sawlogs available to Tasmanian sawmill operators, world's best reservation standards met and exceeded, with some 95 per cent of Tasmania's high quality wilderness reserved, and social and economic outcomes given equal consideration with environmental and heritage objectives.</para><para>One of the major things that this regional forest agreement process does is to create certainty. Well, hopefully it will create certainty. The sorts of arguments we have heard and this matter being brought forward today do not provide any more certainty. It seems to me that all it will provide is more of the same argument that has gone on for the last 10 or 15 years. I guess that is what some of these people are all about, particularly in the Democrats' case. I think one of Senator Bartlett's former colleagues, Senator Bell, would  still be here in this parliament if it had not been for the ridiculous attitude the Democrats took towards some issues. Senator Bartlett may care to look at some of the 
 speeches Senator Bell made when he was in this place. I think Senator Bell, for a Democrat, was rather supportive of sustainable forestry development.</para><para>I take issue with what Senator Forshaw had to say about my colleague Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey, since he has come to this job—I know for a fact, from talking to some of the union representatives in Tasmania—has gained the respect of the CFMEU members. The statement on sustainable forest management in Tasmania put down by Mr Tuckey and Paul Lennon was welcomed by the industry in my state. I also believe that the action plan he intends to put in place and the commitments he has given to encourage downstream processing are all positive things that will help the industry and the people of Tasmania and create jobs. I reiterate that this motion today is inopportune. It has been put forward at the wrong time. I look forward to debating the matter further.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2109</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A great deal has been said about the fact that this debate occurs at a time when the legislation committee is considering this legislation, so I do not propose to add anything further on that point; it has all been said. But certain things occurred during the committee's deliberations, many of which are on the public record, which I believe it is appropriate I refer to today.</para></talk.start><para>The motion we are discussing is the failure of the regional forest agreement process to protect the remaining native forests of Australia. That is one of the more misleading statements that I have ever seen put before this chamber in terms of our being asked to discuss it. The very process that is being pursued as the Labor Party contemplates the RFA process is to lead to renewable, sustainable forests for harvesting together with reserves of forests, not the removal of the native forests, as is suggested in this proposition.</para><para>The first and most important point to be made is the Australian people should not be misled that the RFA process is about removing native forests. It is about retaining native forests either protected from logging or guaranteed to be sustained in a renewable 
 form. It also contemplates the creation of plantations so that, in the future, timber for pulping purposes, for example, will substantially come from the hardwood plantations that are grown as a result of the RFA process. My recollection of the environment movement's views on the use of forests is that it was preferable to use plantations for timber purposes. We have to get to that point somehow. The RFA process, as the Labor Party would contemplate it, will indeed lead us to that process.</para><para>Senator Bartlett's comment that he anticipates that the RFA will hurt small sawmillers flies in the face of the attitude of some of the green supporters who attended the hearings that we conducted in Melbourne. I was interested in the evidence of the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, particularly with regard to downstream processing. I asked for them to send me more information, and Mr Graeme Gooding sent me this letter and reinforced my recollection of something that took place at the hearing. A passage from his letter states:</para><para>I found the whole Senate Inquiry quite astounding with most issues raised by those submitting to your group quite irrelevant.</para><para>He is referring to the greens. He goes on:</para><para>Some seemed to think it was another RAC Timber Inquiry rather than a review about legislation. In particular I found it amazing in our session that the greens applauded the likes of Judy Clark when she essentially advocated closing down the 50 or so viable small (hardwood) businesses in Victoria and replacing them with one or two huge (softwood) corporations. They then laughed when I noted that Demby's sawmill in Toolangi had more than tripled their employment from less than 10 to 30 people. I could not stop thinking about what I thought was a bizarre event—environmental ideologues advocated big business is better than small family companies. Afterwards I recalled two points of relevance:</para><para>1.	 A media report last year noted that Auspine's relatively large pine mill in Portland had doubled its output last year and increased employment by 5 people. Gary Demby's little mill had doubled its output and increased employment by over 20 people. Gary is one of eight hardwood sawmills in the Central Highlands we surveyed who have increased direct employment in total by 160 people by value adding. 
</para><para>It is my recollection that, when that sort of evidence was given, there was an attempt from the audience to belittle the witnesses. There was giggling and laughing—indeed, someone was blowing a whistle when evidence they did not like was being presented. I suppose every group can have its people who misbehave. Unfortunately, there seemed to be an organised pattern of behaviour indicating disrespect for the evidence that was being given.</para><para>Senator Calvert has given evidence of the sort of material that we received in evidence, which I also think is generally publicly known, about the outcome of the RFA in Tasmania. Having gone through numerous inquiries into its timber industry, world heritage areas and logging practices—and I am sure it will go through a number of other inquiries as it follows the RFA process and, as far as is possible, perfect the operation of the timber industry—Tasmania starts with a world-class forestry industry in many respects but will end up with an even better one. At the end of the RFA process, assuming that the Senate gives approval to the process—and that is a matter which I do not propose to comment on now—it will have an even better industry. I would hazard to suggest that, at the end of that period, even more timber will be taken not from native forests but from plantations, and I suspect that plantations will increase as a result of the RFA process.</para><para>One of the problems we have in dealing with this sort of legislation and environment issues generally is the nature of environmental politics. I have been a long-time supporter of environmental issues, and I have supported the environment movement in relation to many issues they have taken up about the forestry industry. Indeed, the forestry industry now will say that some of their past practices were horrendous, were unsustainable and ought to have been changed, and they have recognised that those practices changed, in part, through the contribution of the environment movement. I put on record today that the environment movement has played an important part in correcting some of the problems in the forestry industry and some other environmental issues.</para><para>The problem we have is the environment movement has not become an issues movement but a party political movement. To sustain itself, it needs the big issues to attract voters. It needs the icon environment issue so that it can run around and attract supporters to vote for it at the next election. Unfortunately, if the issue is not there, it has to do something, and that something is manufacture the issue. Unfortunately, there is a strong element of manufacturing issues in the complaints being made about the RFA process.</para><para>I am not saying the process is perfect and I am not saying that there is no scope for improvement. What I am saying is that we have moved from the environment movement saying that we need more and more plantation timber, that pine plantations were bad and that we should have a sustainable forestry industry, and we will get to the point where parts of the environment movement will do anything possible to sabotage the industry, irrespective of the impact that will have on jobs in regional economies in Tasmania, parts of Victoria, parts of New South Wales and parts of Western Australia.

Senators would remember only too well the logging trucks that surrounded Parliament House. That was one of the most dramatic demonstrations. The greens who invaded the East Gippsland area created another dramatic confrontation. All of those confrontations bring instability and uncertainty to the industry. All of them produce great social unrest and conflict for the 6 o'clock news, but that, it seems, is what the Democrats want to take us back to. The truth is they now join the extreme greens.

They were unresearched and fanatical.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Brown interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—They were all those things, Senator Brown. I will give just one example. One group before us was Environment Victoria Inc., as they call themselves. They were involved in the early part of the RFA process and negotiations in East Gippsland. They went to the point of comparing the process of the RFA to Nazism, but they just could not get their point through. Their point was ridiculous. That was the type of language they used and it totally marginalised them in the debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth is that they objected to the outcomes of the RFA, not the processes of it. If the processes fell completely their way, they would not be against RFAs. They objected to the outcome—an outcome that is based on some pretty sound principles, which it looks like they will never agree to. There are 11 national principles stated in the RFA as well as broad criteria for biodiversity. No criteria are broader than these: the protection of 90 per cent or more of high quality wilderness, and East Gippsland meets that criteria; a retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, and East Gippsland meets that criteria; and a benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-1750s distribution of each of the forest communities to be protected, and we meet that criteria and better it.</para><para>The truth is that, without the RFA process, without the RFA outcomes, we are going to go back to the bad old days of confrontation. That is what the Democrats want. Of course, 
 that is what Senator Brown wants. He loves to see himself on the 6 o'clock news. But it will bring down the industry and it will cause great social disharmony.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2112</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Work of Committees</title><page.no>2112</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2112</page.no><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the publication <inline font-style="italic">Work of committees</inline>  for the period 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998 and 1998 statistics.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2112</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>2112</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

It is therefore vital that an effective regulatory regime is in place and maintained to enhance the security of members' benefits and to ensure that superannuation entities operate for genuine retirement purposes.</para><para>The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) provides for the prudential regulation of the superannuation industry between the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). An important aspect of prudential regulation is the monitoring and investigation powers of both Regulators.</para><para>This bill will improve monitoring and investigation powers by increasing the flexibility of the Regulators' existing powers, expanding the parties to whom they apply and increasing penalties for non-compliance. It is vital to the prudential regulation of superannuation moneys in Australia that the Regulators have effective monitoring and investigation powers.</para><para>Another important aspect of the regulatory framework is the existence of a complaints handling body to deal with member's superannuation complaints. The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act (the SRC Act) established the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to resolve fund member complaints about trustee decisions in a manner that is fair, informal and quick. This bill will enable the efficiency and productivity of the Tribunal to be improved, including allowing single member review panels. This will enhance the Tribunal's role in promoting public confidence in the superannuation regime.</para><para>The bill also contains a number of measures which will finetune and clarify the operation of the supervisory framework which will assist trustees in discharging their obligations to fund members.</para><para>In conclusion, this bill implements miscellaneous amendments to maintain and strengthen the superannuation supervisory framework. The amendments will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory regime and improve confidence in the superannuation system more generally.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para></para><para>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 1998</para><para>The bill implements the Coalition Government's choice of superannuation fund measure. This measure was a key initiative in the 1997-98 Budget and involves reforms to give employees greater choice over which superannuation fund or Retirement Savings Account will receive superannuation contributions made on their behalf by their employer.</para><para>The choice of fund arrangements are about giving employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn will give them greater sense of ownership of these savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.</para><para>The Government has consulted widely in putting together the details of this important reform. Extensive consultation led to enhancements of the original model being announced in November 1997. These were designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on employers by allowing greater flexibility in how choice is offered, while ensuring that employees still had an effective choice of fund. The announced enhancements were widely welcomed by industry.</para><para>The Government is continuing to work with industry on the design details of the proposed key features statements. Draft key features statements were prepared in consultation with industry and have been market tested with a variety of groups. The results of the market testing is being fed into a redesign of the key features statements.</para><para>While the Government is prepared to consult and listen and respond to ensure the smoothest possible implementation of choice, it is not prepared to compromise on the fundamentals. The fundamentals of this reform are that employees get a genuine choice as to which fund their superannuation is paid. Models for implementing choice which effectively allow employers to veto an employee's choice simply do not meet this essential criteria.</para><para>The reforms to which this bill gives effect are scheduled to first operate from 1 July 1999 in respect of new employees, having already been deferred from 1 July 1998. It is time to conclude the debate on these important matters to allow their orderly implementation, for the benefit of all Australians as they save for their future.</para><para>I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para></para><para>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</para><para>The bill contains two new exemptions from sales tax. The exemptions are for commercial space equipment and for certain goods imported by overseas participants and delegations attending the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Paralympics and associated events.</para><para>The bill will also remedy some weaknesses in the recently enacted scheme to prevent sales tax evasion in the computer industry and correct a deficiency in the temporary importation exemption.</para><para>The bill will implement the Government's policy to exempt from sales tax space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended for launch into outer space or to be brought back from outer space. This measure was announced on the 23 June this year.</para><para>The exemption will:</para><para>.	 encourage the development of a commercial space launch industry in Australia; and</para><para>.	 provide Australia with access to the growing world demand for commercial space launch facilities.</para><para>The space equipment exemption will apply from the date of Royal Assent. However, there will be a transitional credit for dealings on or after 23 June 1998 and before the date of Royal Assent. This will ensure that, as announced by the Government, dealings on or after 23 June do not bear sales tax.</para><para>The bill will also provide that certain goods, imported by or on behalf of non-Australian Olympic and Paralympic Family Members and delegations and participants in the Olympics, Paralympics and associated events, will be exempted from sales tax.</para><para>This exemption is in line with current sales tax arrangements with respect to SOCOG.</para><para>The first events covered by the new exemption and which occur during 1998 will be the Cultural Olympic event "A Sea Change" and the International Sailing Regatta.</para><para>The exemption will not apply to goods for sale, alcohol and tobacco products, motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, television cameras and equipment for radio and television broadcasting.</para><para>The amendments complement recent changes to the customs law to exempt the same goods from customs duty.</para><para>The exemption will apply from the date of Royal Assent and, as for the space equipment measure, there will be a transitional credit arrangement. The credits will apply to dealings on or after 1 March 1998 (ie the commencement date for the proposed changes to the customs law) and before Royal Assent. 
</para><para>The Government proposes three changes to overcome some technical problems with the new scheme for dealing with sales tax evasion in the computer industry.</para><para>The first change will remove anomalies arising from current descriptions and tariff classifications in the law. This will apply from the date of introduction of the bill.</para><para>The second change will increase the maximum penalty for a person falsely representing himself or herself to be accredited or falsely representing a transaction to be authorised, and will increase the maximum penalty for making improper or false quotes under the law. The new maximum penalties of $5500 will apply from the date of Royal Assent.</para><para>The third change will close a loop-hole that allows traders to falsely present themselves as exporters in order to purchase or lease goods tax-free. This will apply from a date to be proclaimed.</para><para>The amendments will enhance the integrity of the new sales tax rules for computers which have addressed the entrenched culture of sales tax evasion previously evident in parts of the personal computer industry.</para><para>The bill also amends the sales tax law so that goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption, used in Australia, exported and then re-imported, are subject to sales tax at the time of the second importation.</para><para>The amendment will correct a deficiency in the sales tax law from 13 May 1997 which is the date the Government announced the measure.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum explains in detail the changes to the law that the bill contains.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1998</para><para>This bill amends the income tax law to give effect to the following measures:</para><para>Firstly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Tax penalty arrangements.</inline></para><para>This bill gives effect to the 1998-99 Budget announcement to replace the existing late payment penalties in various taxation laws with a uniform tax deductible general interest charge. The new arrangements will be simpler and better reflect movements in market interest rates. The changes follow a review by the Australian Taxation Office of late payment and notification penalties in consultation with professional and representative bodies. That review flowed from the Government's response to the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce. 
</para><para>The charge on an outstanding amount will be calculated daily on a compounding basis. The nominal interest rate from which the daily charge is calculated will be set at the 13 Week Treasury Note rate plus 8 percentage points. The penalty for late lodgement of income tax returns of individuals and the penalty for underpayment of income tax will also adopt the general interest charge.</para><para>Secondly, the</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Alignment of remittance dates </inline></para><para>This bill implements the announcement in the Government's tax reform paper, <inline font-style="italic">Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system,</inline>  that from 1 July 1999 the remittance dates for medium and small Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Prescribed Payments System (PPS) and Reportable Payments System (RPS) payers will move from the 7th to the 21st of the month.</para><para>The alignment to the 21st of the month is in anticipation of a large number of businesses being required to make one payment on the 21st of each quarter to cover most tax debts.Thirdly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Running Balance Accounts. </inline></para><para>This bill also introduces amendments to support a system of running balance accounts. The objective of this measure is to establish a taxpayer accounting system under which the Australian Taxation Office can record and monitor all of a business's different tax liabilities on a single account. Debts under the sales tax, pay as you earn, prescribed payments and reportable payments arrangements for the year ending 30 June 2000 will be administered in this way.</para><para>The introduction of running balance accounts will provide for simpler tax accounting and collection arrangements.</para><para>These new accounting and penalty arrangements will position the ATO to better assist taxpayers in minimising any escalation of taxation debt and will allow for a simpler and more efficient process of penalty calculation.</para><para>They will also enable the ATO to provide a comprehensive statement of a taxpayer's outstanding tax debts at a particular point in time.</para><para>These amendments will provide an accounting platform in the lead up to one running balance style account to support most taxation debts after 1 July 2000.</para><para>And lastly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Tax avoidance: foreign tax credit schemes</inline></para><para>This measure amends the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the act) to render ineffective schemes designed to acquire or generate foreign tax credits that can be used to shelter low-taxed foreign source income from Australian tax. 
</para><para>A foreign tax credit scheme operates on the basis that foreign income is earned which gives rise to an entitlement to foreign tax credits. A scheme is entered into whereby a foreign income stream is acquired by another taxpayer. Where the acquisition cost of the income stream is deductible to that another taxpayer those deductions largely cancel out the foreign income the other taxpayer has now acquired. The major portion of the foreign tax credits which relate to the acquired foreign income stream are then available to offset tax payable on the taxpayer's other foreign income of the same class.</para><para>The Australian Taxation Office became aware that these types of schemes were being promoted in Australia. The Commissioner of Taxation does not accept the efficacy of these arrangements, and proposes to challenge them under the existing law in the courts. To put a stop to the development of future schemes the Government announced on 13 August 1998 that it would amend the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the act to render such schemes ineffective.</para><para>These types of arrangements have also been identified in the United States and the United Kingdom and remedial action has also swiftly been taken in both those countries.</para><para>The amendment is designed to protect the revenue base. In the absence of such swift action the revenue base could be exposed to a significant threat.</para><para>The Government also announced on 13 August 1998, as part of its tax reform package <inline font-style="italic">Tax Reform—not a new tax—a new tax system</inline> , that it will modernise the general anti-avoidance rules. This process will be conducted in line with the principles of the integrated tax code. In view of the threat that the foreign tax credit schemes posed to the revenue base it was necessary to announce the measures and bring legislation to the Parliament as soon as possible rather than await the modernisation of the general anti-avoidance rules.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>GENERAL INTEREST CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998</para><para>The bill accompanies Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998 which replaces existing late payment penalties in various taxation laws with a uniform tax deductible general interest charge.</para><para>The Imposition Bill will impose the new general interest charge as a tax to the extent to which the charge cannot validly be imposed as a penalty.

In this case, the ABA's Standard was not consistent with Australia's obligations under the CER Services Protocol with New Zealand.</para><para>The Committee received 35 submissions and held one public hearing in Canberra. The report of the inquiry, originally planned for the first sitting day after 31 October 1998, was delayed because of the general election on 3 October 1998.</para><para>The current Australian Content Standard requires broadcasters to show Australian programs at least 55 per cent of the time between 6am and midnight. `Australian' is defined according to criteria that are specified in the Standard.</para><para>The majority of submissions strongly supported quotas which they saw as essential for preventing Australian television from being dominated by imports from other countries and for protecting Australian cultural values. The submissions expressed concern that the Court's ruling meant that the ABA would make a new Standard which accepted New Zealand programs for quota purposes. The film and television production industry argued that this would pose a threat to the development of Australian cultural values through television programming. They therefore called for section 160(d) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to be repealed.</para><para>The Committee accepted the advice of the Attorney General's department and of the Department of Foreign Affairs that, while repeal of section 160 (d) would enable the ABA to make a Standard that excludes New Zealand-made programs from the 
 quotas, it would not remove the diplomatic problem that the present Standard is inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the CER Protocol with New Zealand. That problem can only be addressed through negotiations with New Zealand and the Committee is recommending that the government approach the New Zealand government to seek an amendment to the Closer Economic Relations (CER) Protocol which would insert a "cultural industries clause" to exempt services relating to cultural industries from the Protocol.</para><para>The film production industry also expressed its fear that if paragraph 160(d) of the <inline font-style="italic">BSA</inline>  were retained in its present form, other nations who have treaties with Australia which include `no less favoured treatment' clauses, would seek the same favoured treatment accorded to New Zealand under the "australian content" quotas for commercial television.</para><para>The Committee took those fears seriously and it has recommended a number of measures to ensure that the australian content quota does not include film imports from every country with which Australia has a trade treaty.</para><para>The Committee is recommending that in all future trade treaty negotiations with other countries, an exclusion clause for cultural industries should be inserted. This now seems to be accepted international practice.</para><para>The Committee is also recommending that every step should be taken to clarify the status of New Zealand/third party co-productions by negotiating with the New Zealand government with a view to exchanging side letters to the CER Services Protocol to clarify both countries' understanding of the meaning and application of the CER Services Protocol in relation to New Zealand/third party co-productions.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2117</page.no><id.no>r653</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2117</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>—I understand that the committee is about to consider schedule 1, item 20.

 debate on item 19 of schedule 1, we spoke about some of the issues that arise in relation to the enrolment form, prescribed persons and the regulations that now, today, in draft form have at least been provided to the opposition and other interested senators. And, in relation to debate on this matter, I do stress that these particular regulations are very much in just a draft form.</para></talk.start><para>For example, now that I have had an opportunity to look at them, I note the following in part 4 of the regulations dealing with electors who can attest a claim for enrolment:</para><para>11 For paragraph 98(2)(c) of the act:</para><para>(a) an elector is a prescribed class of electors if the elector is a person mentioned in schedule 3; and</para><para>(b) if no person mentioned in schedule 3 is available for the person making the claim, an elector is in a prescribed class of electors if the elector:</para><para>(1)	 is not related to the person making the claim by birth or marriage; and</para><para>(2)	 is approved by an Australian Electoral Officer or the DRO.</para><para>After that draft regulation appears a comment—one assumes, an AEC comment—and let me quote it:</para><para>The notion of a prescribed class involves the presumption that the membership is fixed by the regulations. There is an element of subdelegation in the provision that an officer can approve membership of the class. It would be better for this power to be given by the act.</para><para>Then we go on to `verification of identity', also in part 4. Let me quote from the draft regulations:</para><para>12(1) For subsection 98(2)(a) of the act, the identity of a person making a claim must be verified by at least one of the following original documents:</para><para>(a)	 documentary evidence of the applicant's identity.</para><para>Let me interpolate what is in the document as a comment in respect of the draft regulation `(a) documentary evidence of the applicant's identity'. The comment reads:</para><para>Your instructions refer to section 202B of the Tax Act. That section simply says that an application must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the applicant's identity. There is no definition of what may or may not be acceptable evidence, nothing is added here by referring to the Tax Act.</para><para>And so it goes on. Then we get down to `verification of Australian citizenship' in part 
 13 of the regulations, which I will quote. Part 13(2) states:</para><para>The person's Australian citizenship must be verified by any of the following:</para><para>(a)	 provision of:</para><para>	 (1)	 an Australian citizenship certificate; or</para><para>	 (2)	 an Australian passport; or</para><para>	 (3)	 an Electoral Commission enrolment application form given to the person by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs . . . </para><para>Again, there is a comment in the document which reads:</para><para>I am not sure if this is what you want here. The form was not attached to the instructions. Is this a document with evidence of the person's citizenship given to the person when citizenship is granted?</para><para>We are being asked to agree with draft regulations that are in this form. What about schedule 3 of the draft regulations on electors who can attest claim for enrolment? There the comment reads:</para><para>There is a similar list in the statutory declarations regulations. Could that be adopted? A statutory declaration may well be needed with some urgency while an electoral enrolment is a more routine activity that is prescribed persons for statutory declaration should be more than enough for electoral enrolments.</para><para>This is the form that currently the draft regulations are in. I am not necessarily critical. I appreciate that obviously they have to go through this phase in terms of their development. But the point I made earlier today is that we had this legislation first introduced into the parliament in May of last year. We have had a long time, almost a year, for these regulations to be worked up and developed and, I think, provided in a more complete form than the form that was just received this morning from the minister. I do believe, Mr Temporary Chairman, that is a very substantive point for us to make as well as having to deal here with the substance of the issue.</para><para>There are major problems in relation to item 20—the proposals to insert parts 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D after subsection 98(2) of the act. There are difficulties in some cases with very genuine people with the verification of Australian citizenship. I really think in the circumstances, even with the AEC and the government having finally worked this matter 
 through in draft regulation form, that we do not have a position where this committee ought to be expected to sign on to these regulations. This is totally unacceptable. I think it would be a grave mistake for the committee to just blindly accept the government's proposal in relation to these quite significant changes to the Electoral Act.</para><para>I have said before that what is motivating this is simply paranoia on the part of the government—and I stress that. The government's view, belief, claims, if you like, that there is widespread electoral fraud have never been able to be justified. This is motivated by paranoia on the part of the government; it is not motivated by a desire to ensure that we have maximum integrity in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is the problem.</para><para>As I have said before, this is going to cost an enormous amount of money for what is, at this stage still, a dog's breakfast of a proposal that is before the committee. Why should the committee be so courageous as to bite this one off? Why should we, given the stage of development of the regulations, accept what the government is proposing?</para><para>I question very seriously the government's motivation. I question very seriously the process that has got us up to this stage. I question very seriously the state of development of these regulations, even in their current draft form. I strongly advise the committee not to embrace them at this point. It is for that reason that the opposition will be opposing item 20.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2118</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The regulations can only be put forward in draft form.

It is as simple as that. That is the situation, and nothing could be clearer.</para><para>What we have here is a proposal by the government that there should be some verification of identity for those people enrolling for the first time. What we are saying is that it is quite curious—in fact, more than curious; it is inappropriate—that you have a stricter requirement to open a bank account than you 
 do to get on the roll to vote. Gaining the right to vote is a very important right indeed, and we believe as a government there should be some scrutiny in that process. It is as simple as that. What I am saying is that there are adequate provisions in these regulations for the committee to form a very informed view. In any event, these regulations could be subject to disallowance. At the end of the day, the government has a sound proposal as to the scrutiny for the enrolment of new voters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2119</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats, having listened to the views put forward by the opposition and the minister, and while the minister put forward some reasoned views, are not convinced that this level of complication is required to be added to the act.

It is not, perhaps, as much a threshold issue as some of the others, but we have indicated very clearly our concerns there. I am disappointed that the committee does not share the opposition's concern in relation to the prescribed persons. I would suggest that it is worth all committee members apprising themselves of schedule 3 of the draft regulations: the electors who can 
 attest claim for enrolment. It is very limited, and I think it is going to cause a great deal of logistical difficulties in the real world.</para></talk.start><para>This is the point that I particularly made to Senator Harradine, through the chair.

This is unnecessarily causing grief and difficulty to people who genuinely want to participate in the democratic process. I would say again to Senator Harradine, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that I hope he has cast his eye over this list that has now been made available in draft form. I hope he makes a close examination of it and, as I say, the logistical difficulties it is going to cause so many in the community.</para><para>That is the reason that the opposition has opposed item 19 and item 20, and now item 24.

The problem is simple: I feel we have now reached the point where the goodwill of the opposition is being taken advantage of by the government.</para></talk.start><para>I do not direct this directly at Senator Lightfoot. It just so happens that the Senator Lightfoot incident is the third one since the Senate has resumed this week. We had a senator missing a division earlier in the week in relation to a vote to extend a committee reference, and we have had two instances of senators missing divisions in the committee stage of this bill—Senator Lightfoot on this occasion, Senator Ian Macdonald on the previous occasion, and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell, in the first instance I referred to.</para><para>There is no doubt that if Senator Lightfoot had attended the division the outcome of the vote would have been different. I accept that. The point I make is this: time and again the 
 opposition demonstrates its goodwill by recommitting votes and ensuring that the will of the electorate is reflected on the floor of the Senate as votes are taken. I make this as a very serious point to the government: at some point there has to be an effort made by the government to  lift its game.</para><para>The government cannot slack off on its whip arrangements or on ensuring discipline amongst coalition senators, knowing full well that it really does not matter because the good old opposition on this side of the chamber, because it takes a principled and proper approach to these sorts of issues, will always play ball and agree to recommit votes. That does appear to be a trend that is developing. I hope the minister at the table would agree that that is simply not on. You just cannot depend all the time on the opposition to dig the government out of a hole of its own creation.</para><para>I do not direct this particularly to Senator Lightfoot. I make that point. This is the most recent incident in a long line of failures on the part of the government to get its act into gear. That is not to say that on the very rare occasion opposition senators have not missed divisions and been in similar circumstances. But I tell you what: the numbers on missing divisions are overwhelmingly in favour of the government. There have literally been only a couple of instances since Labor lost government in 1996 when a vote has needed to be recommitted—only two that I can recall—because of an error by an opposition senator.</para><para>Government senators are doing this time and time again. If the government simply takes advantage of this by saying, `If we miss a key vote, what the hell does it matter, because the opposition will recommit the matter and we will get on with it,' that is not good enough. I think it is about time the government recognised that it is not good enough.</para><para>The government should also recognise the appalling example Senator Alston has set in this regard as the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. I suspect that is one of the reasons this has occurred. Senator Alston has made an absolute art form of missing divisions over the last couple of 
 years. As deputy leader, he is in a position in which he ought to be setting an example. If that is the example that is set, we have too many other senators following it, including recently another senior government office holder in the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I make that point very seriously. I think it is a reasonable point that the opposition is entitled to see the government take a little more effort in ensuring discipline in relation to votes in this chamber.</para><para>The arguments that are presented in relation to the courtyard might be right. Maybe the bells do not ring in the courtyards, but there are lights in the courtyards. Senators are supposed to be wearing pagers. There are a range of mechanisms to ensure that we do not have this circumstance occur. I stress: I do not blame Senator Lightfoot, because he is the last in a great long line of government senators who have failed the test of coming to divisions, and it is senior government senators who have set such a bad example.</para><para>Of course, we have also nailed our colours to the mast on this, because we have said that we will do the honourable and proper thing. We will continue to do the honourable and proper thing, but I will tell you what: we are entitled to revisit this if our goodwill is just going to be continually exploited by the government in the way it has. Just because the opposition—and, for that matter, minor party senators and Senator Harradine—agree to recommitting votes it does not means that the processes and procedures of this place can be taken for granted. I hope that is a message that Senator Ellison as the responsible minister in the chamber at the moment and the Government Whip, who is on duty in the chamber at the moment, take on board seriously. I am now saying that the opposition will agree to recommit a vote that yet again has meant that a very important provision that is going to very significantly impact on the electoral processes in this country is going to be changed as a result of opposition goodwill. But we have set the benchmark in this. Do not take advantage of it. Do not exploit it, and do not take us for granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2122</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can assure Senator Faulkner that I do

 every senator is issued with a pager. I know that my office and Senator Calvert's office page senators for divisions. If the senator chooses not to carry the pager and as a result of that this chamber is then asked to recommit a vote, then we should understand that the basis for the recommittal is that the senator has refused to carry a pager.  	 I do accept that sometimes pagers do not go off. In fact I was at a meeting where mine did not work, and I had it checked.

The purpose of these amendments is to place an onus upon political parties when lodging their annual returns immediately following elections to also lodge an up-to-date copy of their constitution, which would then be available for public inspection.</para><para>Political parties remain fairly nebulous institutions in our community and derive their chief source of legality from this Electoral Act that we are discussing today. As the rise and fall of the One Nation party has illustrated, the customs of political parties do not necessarily insulate against improper use being made of those parties or, as we have recently seen, the privileges that attach to such a status. Even getting a clear indication of the structure and manner of operation of some political parties is fairly difficult. Nowadays incorporated associations and trade unions must all lodge constitutions which generally are available for public scrutiny.</para><para>This amendment seeks to make political parties and their organisational structure more transparent. Given, as has also been widely publicised, some of those parties at least are able to potentially be the recipient of a significant amount of public funds, the Democrats believe that it is all the more appropriate that this fairly small measure should be incorporated as part of the act.</para><para>Already when political parties apply for registration under section 126(2)(f) of the act, 
 they have to provide a copy of the constitution of the party. But that is not made publicly available and there is no requirement to provide any updated version at any stage after the party has initially been registered. These amendments seek ensure that when or if the Electoral Commission determines that a political party's application for registration should be accepted and the party should be registered, the commissioner would certify a copy of the party's constitution and make it available for public inspection under section 139 of the act, which deals with inspection of the register of political parties.</para><para>To ensure that that is updated, the related amendment requires the party to put in an up-to-date version of their constitution with their first return to the commission after each federal election to ensure that the public is able to have access to an up-to-date version of that party's constitution in case they try to radically change their structure in the interim. It is basically about ensuring a bit more transparency in the organisational structure of Australia's political parties. The Democrats believe that that is something, particularly in light of recent public debate on this issue, that would be a positive move.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2125</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There may be an element of merit in this proposal that the Democrats have moved by way of amendments.

Might I say at the outset that I know from my own state that the Incorporation of Associations Act requires that any body which is incorporated under that act should have a constitution and that it has to be lodged with what was formerly the corporate affairs office. It is lodged there for public scrutiny and is available for inspection. I am hazarding a guess here, but I would assume that in all other states the situation would be much the same. Political parties are incorporated under such legislation. So there is, I would submit, in state legislation already a situation where a constitution of a political party is lodged with an agency and that it is subject to public scrutiny.</para></talk.start><para>However, having said that, I don't take anything away from the spirit of the proposal 
 put forward by the Democrats. There would be some administrative burden to the AEC in this, although, I would concede, it would not be overly burdensome. But the suggestion of Senator Faulkner's is not a bad one. Perhaps the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters could have a look at this. It is something which we cannot see our way clear to support today but perhaps the committee could have a look at it and include it in its report. It has current terms of reference looking into the 1998 election, and this is something it could take up. But I do not think at this stage the government can see its way clear to supporting either of these proposals.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2127</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will not delay the Senate greatly. I realise the situation with the numbers, and I do welcome at least the indication of interest, if you like, from both the coalition and the ALP and the possibility of exploring this in the upcoming inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Nonetheless, I do think it is worth highlighting that, as Senator Harradine said, it is not that difficult a measure. The constitution is already provided to the Electoral Commission when a registration is first put in, so really the only extra work would be adding that to all the other details that are already required on the register, such as the name of the party and the name and address of the registered officer, et cetera.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think that is overly onerous. I do not think that having one extra piece of paper added to the returns, that have to be put in every year in any case, would generate particularly enormous amounts of administrative work for the Electoral Commission, given the amount it is already required to do in assessing returns of political parties. So I do not believe it would be a major measure.</para><para>On Senator Ellison's point about the availability already of the constitutions in some states under incorporated associations law, I am not an expert on the political structure of every political party registered in the country partly because you cannot see where their constitutions are so you do not know, but I would hazard a guess that a number of parties are not incorporated in various states and I am 
 not sure they would be necessarily available in that regard. In any case, we will pursue this through the joint select committee. In the meantime, anyone who actually wants to see the Democrats' constitution at any stage should look on our web site.

For example, each member of a family could donate separately or a family and a company could donate up to the disclosure limit.</para><para>The problem here is that the coalition parties simply do not like political disclosure. It is as simple as that. They have never supported it. Their use of the Greenfields Foundation rort does nothing to inspire any confidence at all in the arguments they have brought to bear in relation to these particular clauses. We are going to be pursuing further amendments in the Senate to try to close once and for all that Greenfields Foundation rort.</para><para>As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have always advocated tight and transparent 
 funding and disclosure provisions. We are not going to allow items 44 and 45 to see the Liberal Party national secretariat fundamentally and very significantly undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, because that is what these items do. These items are key provisions in this bill, and the Senate really has to stand up and be counted on this issue. We need to retain the integrity of the Electoral Act and ensure that those who donate to and support political parties have those donations disclosed. That is in this parliament's interest, and I would suggest to the committee that it is very much in the public interest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2128</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too am opposed to the proposed increase from $1,500 to $10,000 in subsection 305B(1) and from $1,500 to $5,000 in subsection 314AC(1). The matter has been canvassed by Senator Faulkner, but we all know that even the $1,500 can be circumvented. For example, an organisation could pay its members certain funds which are then to be paid to the particular political party, whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any other party. For example, porn merchants could be organising their video outlets and individuals to pay certain moneys to a particular political party, each of those donations being $1,499. Eleven organisations or individuals could pay that and be reimbursed, and there is no way that could be tracked by the AEC.</para></talk.start><para>This is the sort of situation that can arise even under the current provisions. You are never going to have complete transparency, and that is the point I am making. In particular, you will never have complete transparency in a situation where the party—whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any individual party—does not want to be seen to be receiving donations from particular sources. What can be done about that, I do not know. Possibly nothing can be done about it, but let us at least keep the lower threshold that is currently in the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2128</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with both the previous speakers. It is difficult to prevent people from usurping the spirit of the current laws which state that, if 
 you donate $1,500 or more, it must be disclosed. To raise that to $10,000 is to raise by six or eight times the ability of large amounts of money to be transferred by way of donations to the political parties without it being traced. It is when people go to some length to hide the fact that the donation is coming that I suspect political leverage is most wanted as an outcome by those donors. Therefore, there is the greatest need for those people to be under scrutiny.</para></talk.start><para>I do not know why the government wants this change. I would be interested to hear in succinct terms from the minister why the government thinks keeping a longer list of donors who contributed $1,500 or more is more difficult than keeping a shorter list of those who contributed $10,000 or more. One cannot help but suspect that the government sees a very clear advantage in having more of its donors shielded from the glare of public scrutiny. If that is the case, that is not a good thing. If that is not the case, then why bring these amendments forward? It does not add up. They are not a good thing; they are going in the wrong direction. The Greens, like the previous speakers, totally oppose the government amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2129</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to that last comment, these amounts have not been altered since, I believe, the 1992-93 financial year, so I would submit the effluxion of time has some relevance here. When these amounts were set, it was thought that there were obvious levels below which there should not be any disclosure and that, over time, those levels naturally would increase with the CPI, inflation and other things.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to private donations to political parties, it is quite important because the government does not see that political parties should be entirely dependent on public funding. There are some who would say, `Let's rub out private funding entirely and just have it on public funding.' But if that were the case, you would then have parties, as I mentioned before, that would simply run in an election, have a percentage of the vote and collect their cheque. Other parties wanting to 
 do more would want to not only rely on public funding but also rely on their own resources in obtaining donations and donations in kind.</para><para>I think that all political parties have received private donations—quite properly so. There is perhaps a perception that this question of donation to a political party has some cloud over it. The legislation recognises that donations to political parties are a way of life. The question is the level at which you draw the line for disclosure purposes.</para><para>The government believes that, in view of the effluxion of time and the fact that there is a question of the amount by which you might deter people from making a donation if it were to be disclosed—for instance, $500 to $1,500 for an individual, and $1,500 to $10,000 and $1,500 to $5,000 for the organisations—that could well deter people from making a donation because they do not want to have the disclosure. Obviously, some people do not want to make their political allegiances public. I think that is a part of our system which is important. We have a secret ballot—no-one questions that. The country led the way in that.</para><para>But the situation is that the support of political parties is not something that everyone would wear on their sleeves, for obvious reasons. I would expect there would be supporters of the opposition who would not want to be readily identified as supporters of the opposition, for personal reasons or other reasons—and I respect that. But it is a question of the line you draw in relation to disclosure.</para><para>I can foreshadow that the opposition has some amendments which the government will be supporting, the ones dealing with associated entities. We support those because we do not want to see the system circumvented. We have indicated to the opposition that we will be supporting these amendments. There are some that we have a difficulty with due to technicalities, but that is purely the definition of a loan and a credit card. We will deal with them later. But, right now, the government would commend these amendments to the committee. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2130</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This section of the legislation is of great concern to the Democrats. I don't think it would be blowing our own trumpet too much to say that the issue of disclosure of donations and openness in relation to transparency of funding and donations to political parties is something that the Democrats have pursued with some vigour for many years. Our concern goes back to my predecessor from Queensland, Senator Michael Macklin, who pursued these sorts of issues with great diligence over many years.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to emphasise what we are discussing here in this part of the bill: we are not talking about rubbing out private donations or the ability for political parties to receive funds from private sources—not at all—in fact, I would quite like the Democrats to receive a lot more funds and donations than we do from private sources. I am quite happy to be open about that.</para><para>Why the Democrats have concerns with this part of the bill is that it is not about rubbing out private donations—far from it—it is about rubbing out an appropriate level of transparency and openness about private donations. That is something that I am quite sure all of us would agree is of great concern to the Australian public: that people have some ability to be aware of who is donating and who is providing funding—as long as the transparency is there. It is similar to senators and members having to individually declare our assets and have that publicly available or tabled. It is not a way of saying that we cannot have assets; it is a way of being open and upfront about what they are so that there is transparency in the system and some opportunity for public faith in the system.</para><para>As I have said a number of times in this debate, public faith in the system is seriously stretched in Australia at the moment. As a parliament, we do not want to be supporting measures that will further increase public cynicism or will lead to a decrease in public faith in the political and parliamentary process. The Democrats are opposed to the two sections of the bill that we are debating at the moment—again, just to make it clear to those multitudes listening to the debate. In parts of 
 the legislation currently, if a person in any one financial year makes gifts totalling $1,500 or more to any registered political party or the same state branch of a political party, they have to put in a return to the Electoral Commission.</para><para>What this measure seeks to do is change that to $10,000; that is, for a person now to be able to make a gift totalling $10,000 to the same registered political party or the same state branch. Of course, all of us here know that you can donate underneath the threshold to more than one branch of a political party and not be required to put in a return. So it is a significant leap. Whilst I take Senator Ellison's point about the effects of the CPI since these figures were first put in, we also have to look at the state of the world as it is now and the appropriate level of public expectation about what level of donations should be declared. I suggest that $10,000 is well and truly over and above that.</para><para>Similarly, the bill before us seeks to amend the act so that, instead of a party having to include particulars of where a sum amounting to more than $1,500 has come from, that amount will now move up to $5,000. Again, if this were to go through, once you factor in that a person or an organisation can donate to a number of different state branches of the one party plus the national level, you would have the ability to donate just under $5,000 to each state and territory branch plus, possibly, the national level. This would put you up around $40,000-odd. Over the course of an electoral cycle, a three-year period, you get up into well over $100,000 that can be donated to a political party as a whole, without there being any opportunity or requirement for that to be declared. In the view of the Democrats, that is well and truly over and above the level of transparency we should have in our Electoral Act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Reynolds)</name></talker><para>—The question is that schedule 1, items 44 and 45, stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now move to Democrat amendment No. 8, that schedule 1, item 46, be opposed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2131</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats oppose schedule 1, item 46. We are here talking about a similar issue of principle. Item 46 of the legislation again relates to reporting thresholds, and it is another section of the bill that the Democrats oppose. Just to clarify again what this one particularly deals with, the section above section 314AC(2) of the act currently states that, if the sum of all the amounts received by or on behalf of the party from a person or organisation during a financial year is $1,500 or more, the return must include the particulars of that sum. But currently in the act, in calculating that sum, any amount less than $500 does not need to be counted.</para></talk.start><para>What this part of the bill seeks to do is raise that amount of $500 to $1,500. So, basically, any amount less than $1,500 does not need to be counted in determining whether or not a contribution for a financial year is $1,500 or more. Again, from the Democrats point of view, this looks like an inappropriate weakening of transparency requirements of the legislation. Again, this is a measure that, for reasons similar to those that I have just outlined, the Senate should oppose.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that schedule 1, item 46, stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now move to opposition amendment 1 on sheet 1236.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>2131</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move opposition amendment 1 on sheet 1236:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Clause 4, page 2 (line 12), omit "amendments made by items 44, 45 and 46 apply", substitute "amendment made by item 46 applies".</para><para>This amendment is consequential to our previous decision in relation to items 44 and 45.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Reynolds)</name></talker><para>—We now move to Democrat amendment No. 14.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>2131</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that our amendment No.

I want to say this, being as generous as I can in the circumstances: the government did take some steps to address recommendation 10 of the March 1998 report of the AEC into funding and disclosure by broadening the investigative powers of the AEC in dealing with and determining whether or not an organisation is an associated entity.</para><para>We found out, as senators would know, during questioning of the Australian Electoral Commission at Senate estimates hearings last week, that the AEC recently utilised these powers for the first time to serve notice on the Greenfields Foundation on 15 January 1999. While those particular government amendments were sufficient for the purpose of broadening the investigative powers of the AEC in pursuing suspected associated entities, they have not gone far enough in relation to the crucial issue of closing the loophole in the legislation. That is what the opposition wants to do.</para><para>Let me explain to the committee what our amendments here are about. Firstly, they tighten the definition of `associated entity'. Secondly, they close the loophole in the event of the loan being given ultimately becoming a gift. Thirdly, they prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information, such as terms and conditions of the loan, are disclosed. I might continue arguing this very strong case tomorrow.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2134</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Safety Review Committee</title><page.no>2134</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2134</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document. 
</para><para>This is the final report of the Safety Review Committee which has the responsibility to ensure the safety of the operations at Lucas Heights. It is the final report because its responsibilities are being taken over by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and its councils and committees. The responsibility of this committee cannot be underestimated. Nuclear safety is an issue of paramount concern, and I have no reason to doubt the integrity or the qualifications or the commitment to safety or even the effectiveness of the committee in ensuring safety. But this report gives me no reason to have a lot of confidence either. One of the problems is the superficiality of much of the report. Whenever there is something of potential concern, it gets a glancing mention which raises more questions than answers. I will come to some of those concerns and the questions that come to mind in a moment.</para><para>The other problem is that the committee considered there were no matters arising in regard to the committee's functions B, C and D during the period of the report. These are the functions involving investigating and advising on matters which may have adverse consequences or safety implications. Even from the relative superficiality of the report, it is clear that there were matters that could well have been investigated. For example, there is the matter of the granting of temporary exemption from certain operating limits and conditions.</para><para>The report gives us no indication of which operating limits or conditions. Perhaps the minister could throw some light on this. Were these exemptions related to allowed levels of radiation exposure? What were the causes of the events which led to exemptions? Were the causes age related and do they have implications for the reactor surviving to the year 2005? Following these exemptions, the report tells us, the Nuclear Safety Bureau required ANSTO to provide data on the state of the reactor 24 hours after start-up. It would be nice to know that what that data said was okay.</para><para>Another issue worthy of investigation is the advice from the Nuclear Safety Bureau that, with foreseeable resource demands for the 
 replacement reactor project, the potential exists for resources to be diverted from HIFAR to the detriment of current high standards of reactor operations. When the Nuclear Safety Bureau starts flagging concerns like this, it is time to take notice. They draw attention to the loss of two senior staff, which they say represents a significant loss of managerial and technical expertise.</para><para>What this highlights is the issue of the skills base in Australia and the potential for difficulties in staffing the new reactor and the various monitoring bodies, especially when the new reactor might be running alongside the existing one for a period of time. It is good to see the Nuclear Safety Bureau being proactive in drawing attention to this problem, and I wonder if they have expanded on those concerns in the environmental impact statement on the new reactor.</para><para>Another issue arises in relation to the intermediate level liquid wastes. We are told liquid waste will be treated in a hot cell by a process of evaporation, de-ammoniation and solidification. We have been told this before. The question is: when will the process start? We are told the solid product may be suitable for processing into a ceramic form similar to synroc. May? This is typical of attitudes throughout the nuclear industry: create any amount of waste and work out what to do about it eventually. This is really not good enough.</para><para>Then there is the problem of the water in the spent fuel storage tubes. Again, it gets a mention in the report, but again the interesting thing is what is not said. How did the water get there? If it is rain water, then it must have been there for more than 10 years. What does that say about monitoring? How often are they checked and how? What about some genuinely independent monitoring? The International Atomic Energy Agency's monitoring is only to see if the seal is still in place. That is not safety monitoring. Is there any chance that corroded fuel elements will corrode further now that they are back in the ground? If water can get in through a faulty seal, one must wonder what can get out.</para><para>One area in which the Safety Review Committee seems to have been doing some 
 good work is in putting pressure on the industry in relation to worker safety. It is disappointing to note that there are still three radiation related injuries and five occasions on which radioactive materials were an accident factor. Thankfully, the doses involved were relatively small, but the fact is that any radiation accident is a serious worry. In the same way as we must work towards zero accidents, we must also work towards zero waste emissions. What guarantees can the minister give that the budget for capital works upgrade of waste management will be sufficient to achieve that end?</para><para>Finally, it is worth noting that what I see as deficiencies in the comprehensiveness of this report may be addressed to some extent by the strengthened community representation and reporting requirements which we achieved through amendments to the ARPANSA legislation.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2135</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to make some comments with respect to the annual report of the Safety Review Committee for 1997-98. As Senator Margetts has noted, this is the final report of the Safety Review Committee. That body has now been superseded by the establishment of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, colloquially referred to as ARPANSA. The establishment of ARPANSA is noted in the report, but for the period that this report covered the legislation had gone through the House of Representatives but was awaiting approval by the Senate. That is noted at pages 5 to 7 of the report.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to make some comments about the establishment of ARPANSA. Like many, I was looking forward to the establishment of ARPANSA as setting the scene for an increased level of scrutiny and regulation of Australia's nuclear industry. As honourable senators are aware, I have a particular interest and involvement in this issue because I happen to reside in the Sutherland Shire, not far from the Lucas Heights reactor and, like all honourable members of parliament, what is close to home is often an issue that is dear to our hearts. Of course, the issues involved here are ones which affect all Australians. 
 Consequently, it is absolutely essential that any body established to oversee the operations of our nuclear industry, particularly the operations of ANSTO, is totally independent.</para><para>My initial enthusiasm for the establishment of ARPANSA, which filled in many of the gaps that existed in the regulatory system within Australia, has waned somewhat. It has waned, firstly, because the legislation, when it was brought to this Senate, was grossly inadequate. It was only because of the amendments that were put forward by the opposition parties and the Greens in this chamber that we ended up with an act which goes a long way to ensuring that improved system of regulation and improved system of scrutiny. Since then, however, I have become rather concerned about what the future holds.</para><para>At the recent Senate estimates committee on 8 February—the Community Affairs Legislation Committee estimates—representatives of ARPANSA and the Department of Health and Family Services appeared before the committee. In evidence to that committee it was indicated that the chief executive officer's position at ARPANSA has still not been filled on a permanent basis. A Dr John Loy is in an acting capacity.</para><para>What was more disturbing was that—following questions from myself to the departmental officer—it was revealed in evidence that a selection committee had been established within the department to draw up a short list of applicants to go to the minister, from which he would make a choice as to who the new chief executive would be. The most disturbing feature of all is that one of the three members of that committee drawing up that short list of applicants is the current head of ANSTO, Professor Helen Garnett.</para><para>I make no personal reflection upon Professor Helen Garnett's professionalism or qualifications but, as is said in the law, justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. If ARPANSA is to be an independent regulatory authority charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of ANSTO—in particular, the Lucas Heights reactor—then the head of ANSTO, the body to be regulated and scrutinised, should not be on the selection committee determining who should head up 
 this independent regulatory authority. I am amazed by that and I would urge the government to rethink its approach to filling this position. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>2136</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name></talker><para>—Order!

The role of the state is to ensure that mechanisms exist so that the weak and the vulnerable do not fall prey to others in society who would wish to take advantage of them. To this end, we have established in this country—and elsewhere in the Western world—elaborate mechanisms to protect the weak and vulnerable. The problem arises, however, that sometimes those systems become corrupted. Sometimes, organs of the state, instead of being a protection for the weak and the vulnerable, become instead mechanisms of oppression.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight, in the first of two planned contributions in this chamber, I want to outline the circumstances by which one of those organs of the state, instead of protecting the weak and vulnerable people—as the intention was when it was established—became a mechanism to continue the oppression of the weak and the vulnerable. The organ to which I refer was the then Australian Securities Commission. The matter in question arose out of a failed fraudulent investment scheme in Queensland called Aust-Home Investments. It was a scheme which, at its height, conned hundreds of people into investing their funds, never to see them again. To this day, the promoters of this scheme have not been prosecuted. They have been allowed to go unscathed by the law, notwithstanding the fact that what they did constituted a criminal fraud.</para><para>I will outline how that situation arose. It was because of the manner in which investi 
 gators in the Australian Securities Commission handled, or mishandled, the investigation of the case. The circumstances were these. On 24 April 1991, the Australian Securities Commission commenced an investigation, under section 13 of the Australian Securities Commission Act, into the affairs of Aust-Home Investments Ltd. On 27 and 30 May of that same year, they attended the premises of Aust-Home Investments and served statutory notices on 13 scheme companies—that is, companies associated with the principal entity, including all core entities. Certain documents were obtained as a result of those notices being served, but the ASC came to believe that other documents were not produced which should have been produced under those notices. Consequently, from 30 June until October 1991, the ASC conducted examinations of 21 persons related to that scheme. Some of the people who were examined were, in fact, scheme promoters, but many others who were examined were innocent victims of the fraud.</para><para>On 30 and 31 July 1991, and also on 6 August 1991, search warrants, pursuant to section 10 of the Crimes Act, were executed on offices which belonged to Aust-Home Investments at Astor Terrace in Brisbane and on 9 August warrants were executed on the residence of a scheme promoter. An enormous amount of information was obtained. How, then, can it be that, in spite of a substantial investigation, in spite of the fact that millions of dollars had disappeared, and in spite of the fact that millions of dollars of incorrect tax deductions had been claimed—innocently by the victims of the fraud but as a deliberate consequence on the part of the promoters—nobody has been prosecuted? The answer to this question lies in something called the derivative use immunity.</para><para>The problem was that the examinations were conducted under provisions of the Australian Securities Commission law contained in section 19 of its act, which enabled the investigators to compel people to answer questions. The problem was that evidence obtained under compulsion could not be used in a prosecution against the people who were the subject of the examination. So all of the 
 evidence obtained by the investigators in their examinations of the promoters was tainted evidence. It was flawed from the start. So, notwithstanding the fact that all of the information was available to the investigators of the Australian Securities Commission, once they had obtained all that information that showed what had happened to the money no prosecutions arose.</para><para>Over the years I have detailed some of the activities of the promoters of this scheme. I do not intend in this place at this time to rehash that, but honourable senators who are interested can find it easily in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. They will find, for example, that these promoters tried on subsequent dates in different places to perpetuate the same schemes in other states to con other innocent investors. One of the claims that the promoters used when they went to these other states and set up similar schemes was that it could not have been illegal to do what they had done because otherwise they would have been prosecuted by the Australian Securities Commission. A glib line, a line that tellingly assisted them in conning other innocent people.</para><para>But it was not just the promoters who were examined under section 19. Some innocent investors, for example, Mrs Margot Bunt in Queensland, were also examined. The emotional toll that this took on Mrs Bunt and others is incalculable. Many investors had their private assets frozen for years whilst the Australian Securities Commission continued with the fiction that they were ultimately going to prosecute the scheme promoters. However, no prosecutions arose. Eventually, a condensed report was prepared by the Australian Securities Commission, dated 19 October 1995. This report sought to explain why no prosecutions took place. Section 17 of that report at clause 8.1.5 says:</para><para>In the immediate case, it was believed that the immunity unavoidably affected the admissibility against the principal scheme promoter of all evidence obtained by the ASC on execution on 9 August 1991 of search warrants at 35 Astor Terrace office of the scheme and the promoter's residential address. This was because the sworn information relied upon by the ASC to support the granting of the subject warrants made a general reference to answers given during ASC examination pursuant to Section 19 of the ASC law on 6 August 1991 
 during the course of which privilege against self incrimination was claimed.</para><para>The report goes on to say:</para><para>In late January 1995, following consideration of advice received from DPP, it became apparent that all evidence obtained by the ASC subsequent to execution of the warrants, but which in any way was sought by the ASC in whole or partial reliance on the search warrant evidence may be inadmissible. In practical terms, it is believed that the immunity would also impact upon the admissibility on all other evidence obtained subsequent to the examination.</para><para>But the fact is that in 1991 the ASC knew of the impact of the derivative use immunity and in fact mention was made of it on 13 August 1991 in a submission to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, in which the ASC said that care had to be taken in framing an investigation to ensure that derivative use immunity did not allow criminals to get off the hook. Yet this is what happened, and the ASC continued with this fiction for four years to cover up what could at best be described as its own negligence. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  an opinion from Hunt &amp; Hunt Lawyers and an attachment thereto.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Hunt &amp; Hunt</para><para>Lawyers</para><para>Incorporating</para><para>Thompson King Connolly</para><para>OPINION RE:  MRS MARGOT BUNT</para><para>Mrs Bunt has consulted us over many months in relation to matters relating to Aust-Home Investments Limited and the investigation by the Australian Securities Commission (as it then was) of the affairs into that company in the early 1990s.</para><para>We have previously prepared a memorandum setting out a chronology of the events that occurred in that matter and append a copy of it.</para><para>What was clear at the time the memorandum was prepared and what remains clear today is that practices and procedures of the Australian Securities Commission (as it was then) were either not followed in the course of the investigation in relation to Aust-Home Investments Limited and associated companies and its directors or were disregarded.

The term implies accidental or unintended consequences. However, in the 13 August 1991 Submission to the Joint Committee on Corporations &amp; Securities, it discusses in paragraph 2 the "practical and substantive difficulties arising out of the derivative use immunity." In clause 2.1 the Submission states:-</para><para>". . . .if an investigation is to proceed, a plan is prepared having regard to the means available to the ASC to gather information as evidence."</para><para>In Clause 2.2.2, the submission states:-". . . when the investigation plan is being prepared, the ASC cannot know whether it will pursue civil remedies or criminal prosecutions or both, nor will it be in a position to remedy the specific remedies or charges which will arise for consideration of a possible or likely defendant. The strategy which must be adopted, therefore, is that the Commission must have regard to the derivative use of immunity so as to minimise any prejudice to the possibility of either civil or criminal proceedings."</para><para>Why, then would the ASC be surprised by the advice in January 1995 of DPP as to the impact of 
 the derivative use immunity rule on the evidence obtained as a result of the execution of the warrants in the same month as the ASC was submitting it concern as to the impact of those warrants in its submission to the Joint Committee? It is perfectly clear that the ASC understood the problems involved. In this case, did the ASC proceed knowing the possible consequences and notwithstanding those consequences? Simply put, the statements made in paragraph 2 of the submission make it clear ASC knew in August 1991 the difficulties that existed by reason of the derivative use immunity rule and that, in recognition of the difficulty, it had put a procedure in place within ASC to take that into consideration. If it was aware of the consequences, why did it state in its Report to the Minister in clause 8.1.6 line 2 that "it became apparent. . . .", which conveys to the reader that this was a position which ASC did not appreciate or understand before that time? This would mean that the practice referred to in the Submission was not on this occasion followed. If that was true, Mrs Bunt is entitled to know why that was not done.</para><para>See Girvan Report 1.1 where demonstrates the existence of procedures which, when followed, avoided a scenario by which the persons suspected of offences were not orally examined.</para><para>Our client finds no adequate explanation has been given to her.

Given the facts of the situation and the efforts of the Carr government, it is the Howard government and Senator Vanstone that should put up or shut up.</para></talk.start><para>Last December Senator Vanstone claimed in a press release that the Commonwealth was winning the war on drugs. Yesterday she was attacking Bob Carr and the New South Wales government for failing to stem the drug problem in New South Wales. How can the Commonwealth be winning the war on drugs if the New South Wales situation is as bad as 
 Senator Vanstone suggests? Surely New South Wales is not faring as badly as Senator Vanstone suggests or the tough on drugs strategy is not winning the war on drugs. Which is it?</para><para>I suggest there is no easy answer to the problems Australia is facing with the increasing use of illicit drugs. There is no magic wand that can be waved that will make the drug problem go away. But the New South Wales government under Bob Carr is certainly doing its best and exploring all options to deal with the drug problem, with very little help from the Commonwealth government. Here are a few facts for the good senator about what is really happening in the New South Wales.</para><para>More drugs are being seized in New South Wales. In the year to June 1998, drug detections in New South Wales rose by 12 per cent. In 1997, a total of 211 kilograms of heroin was seized, which was almost 80 kilograms more than under the previous coalition government reign. Last year just under half a billion dollars worth of heroin was seized in New South Wales alone. The Carr government has increased the number of police specifically targeting drugs. There are almost 90 more police men and women solely responsible for fighting the war against drugs than there were previously under the coalition government.</para><para>The New South Wales police agencies that focus on drugs and drug related crime have been reconstructed so that they are more effective. This is a direct result of the damning evidence to the New South Wales police royal commission about corrupt practices in the old Drug Enforcement Agency—a system which the New South Wales opposition has repeatedly advocated a return to. In 1997-98, the New South Wales Crime Commission seized assets from major drug dealers more than ever before. More than $11 million was seized. More major drug offenders have been arrested.</para><para>The Carr government has recently spent large amounts of money on new facilities for detoxification and drug and alcohol treatment in Sydney's west, on the north coast, and on the Central Coast. And is this represented in 
 the report mentioned by Senator Vanstone? No. The report which the senator is using as the basis for her attacks on Bob Carr is flawed. The methodology is defective. It does not consider changes in accounting procedures when it claims that the per capita expenditure on health related drug programs in New South Wales has fallen. It does not consider recent initiatives such as the spending on new detoxification facilities or the money for the trialling of naltrexone—for which there was no help from the federal government. The report and the federal government are also ignoring the Carr government's newest initiative of the drug court.</para><para>The New South Wales government is leading the way with the drug court. There is $12 million of new spending on the court, including $5.6 million for new drug treatment services. The aims of the drug court are to reduce crime caused by heroin addiction, to help the offender get off drugs, and to reduce recidivism. The American experience has shown that the drug court can be quite successful in achieving these objectives.</para><para>The drug court provides an opportunity for drug addicts who have committed crimes to support their addiction to get treatment. To be eligible for the drug court, offenders must be dependent on drugs, facing a prison term, prepared to admit guilt and willing to participate in the treatment program. However, those charged with sexual or violent offences cannot go before the court. If the offender admits guilt and chooses treatment, their sentence is suspended, and they are given 12 months of drug treatment and rehabilitation. The offender must comply with strict rules, including regular court appearances and random drug testing. If these rules are breached, strict penalties, including imprisonment, will apply.</para><para>Of course the drug court is no panacea, nor is it going soft on drugs. Instead, it is just another part of the multifaceted approach of rehabilitation, education and tough law enforcement undertaken by the New South Wales government and Bob Carr. The government in New South Wales is doing what it can to resolve the drug problem.</para><para>But what is the federal government doing? The federal government, not the New South Wales government, has jurisdiction over imports to Australia. The New South Wales government cannot do much about customs at all. That is a federal responsibility.</para><para>According to statistics, all heroin is imported into Australia, but it is estimated that only 10 per cent of the 2,000 kilograms of heroin used in Australia each year is detected. Only two per cent of international flights are searched for prohibited drugs. That means that 98 per cent of international flights are not searched at all. So unless Customs or the Federal Police are made aware that person X is likely to be smuggling drugs the drugs will just fly straight into our country.</para><para>Heroin enters Australia predominantly through commercial shipping and flights—with the much larger quantity through importation by sea cargo. But Australian Customs searches only three in 10,000 containers. That is 0.03 per cent of all containers that enter this country. So for the three containers that are searched, 9,997 are not.</para><para>Eighty per cent of heroin enters Australia though Sydney, and Sydney is Australia's principal distribution centre, unfortunately. All evidence supports an increased effort in Sydney, but the National Illicit Drug Strategy, of which Senator Vanstone is so proud, will divert resources away from Sydney. This is precisely the opposite of what is needed.</para><para>There are no easy answers to the issue of illegal drugs and the problems that result from their use. But Senator Vanstone's approach of claiming credit when there is none to be claimed and then attacking the one state government in Australia which is daring to explore new avenues for coping with drug related crime is an unhelpful and unconstructive contribution to a very important debate facing our society today.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Sale—Committee Inquiry</title><page.no>2141</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2141</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to complete some remarks I made yesterday after question time in response to Senator Alston's remarks when he said: </para></talk.start><para>It has been perfectly clear that there has been a pattern of obstruction and a deliberate attempt being made on a regular basis to stall proceedings.</para><para>He was referring to me. If anyone is putting at risk the time line for completion of the Telstra sale inquiry, it is the government. And if there was any question of my wanting to delay the proceedings, I could have easily done so on Monday during that hearing, when there was not a quorum and the hearing process could have been stopped at that point. But I did not do that, because I have at all times—as have other members of the committee—made every attempt to cooperate, however absurd the government's time lines turn out to be. 	 There is no need for me to go over those time lines tonight, but it must be said that submissions to that inquiry closed on 15 January. The government says there have been two months, but of course December-January is not an ideal time to call for submissions to an inquiry, particularly when this inquiry is competing with two other inquiries of the committee.</para><para>But the point is that on this inquiry, as on all others, I have made every effort to fit in with the wishes of the chair and the other members of the committee. Let us take the events leading up to yesterday's hearing. On Thursday, 3 February the hearing in Canberra was scheduled to finish at 4.45 p.m. I had a meeting arranged with two of my colleagues in Sydney at 7.30 that evening prior to a half-day meeting the following day, and I arranged to fly out at 5.20 p.m. from Canberra on that Thursday night.</para><para>During estimates, the committee met and government members—no doubt on the instructions of Senator Alston—proposed that we hold a Senate inquiry one evening during estimates. It is my understanding that all senators are entitled to attend estimates, and I certainly had many issues I wished to and subsequently did raise with the environment minister. That estimates session did not conclude until around 11.30 p.m. that night. Had we scheduled the Telstra hearing for five o'clock on that day, it would have to have been cancelled and arrangements with people who would have appeared would also have had to be cancelled. In any case, I was not prepared to give up what I regard as a very 
 important part of my role in participating in estimates, particularly in the areas of environment and education, and I stand by that decision.</para><para>As Senator Bishop mentioned on Monday, a short private committee meeting agreed that we would complete the inquiry on the morning of Monday the 15th. I indicated that our regular party room meeting was on at 9.30 a.m. and that, particularly since this was the first meeting of the new sitting, I was not prepared to proceed beyond that point. I was willing to start at 8 o'clock or earlier to allow time for further questions of the department and for Telstra's presentation. In any event, the committee decided to schedule the meeting for 8.30 a.m. on Monday, and this decision was made in a private meeting last week before I had a chance to arrive, in spite of the fact that I came as soon as I was advised. I understand it was decided to conduct the hearing until 10.45 a.m. in the knowledge that I could not be there beyond 9.30 a.m.</para><para>Senator Carr and I were ready to begin at the appointed time on Monday, but it was, in fact, almost half an hour later that the teleconferencing link was actually made through to Telstra in Sydney and Melbourne, leaving just 30 minutes for the hearing. Again, it was not my fault that proceedings were delayed. As I have said, the hearing finally did go ahead without a quorum. The government must take full responsibility for both the impossible time lines it has adopted and the abuses of process that have been necessary to achieve that.</para><para>I am happy to show Senator Alston my diary, which shows that between 3 February and 15 March there are only two weekdays on which there are no Senate committee hearings or parliamentary sittings, and I have offered both of these as possible hearing dates. If Senator Alston and Senator Eggleston insist on bulldozing government legislation through the Senate committee process and attacking the Democrats with false accusations, the cooperative approach which I have been describing may have to give way to an insistence on formal compliance with standing orders. The Democrats remain at all times professional and responsible in our handling 
 of government legislation, and it is my view that Senator Alston should apologise for his intemperate and misleading remarks.</para><para>Last night the committee did indeed finish the Telstra sale inquiry, and it did so at around 11 p.m. when there was sufficient time for us to ask questions of both Telstra and the department, although I must say that a lot of questions still remain to be answered, and I look forward to the minister's response to those when the bill comes into the parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: Battery Hens</title><page.no>2143</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2143</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week the RSPCA launched a national campaign to help keep hens out of cages. The campaign calls for an end to the production of eggs by intensive husbandry. The RSPCA calls it `battery hen produced eggs'. The campaign is being supported by radio commercials, postcards, posters and direct mail. Letters have already been sent to some of us, imploring that we should help the society to end the suffering of battery caged hens. The RSPCA calls for `the Australian public to support alternative systems of egg production for the sake of layer hens'. In fact, they say it is up to the Australian public to care enough about the suffering of what they call battery hens to insist on humane egg production. I quote from a letter the society's president, Dr Wirth, wrote to me, which claims:</para></talk.start><para>.. preventing hens from performing natural behaviours causes immense frustration.</para><para>Further, he said:</para><para>. . . restricted movement and lack of exercise in battery cages causes skeletal and muscle weakness and the cages' mesh floors and lack of perches can cause serious muscle damage.</para><para>He goes on to claim that legislation should be passed in every state and territory to ban battery hens. You might say this is the role of the RSPCA, that concern for the plight of animals is a primary part of the society's objective to prevent cruelty to animals by enforcing the existing laws—`all creatures great and small', according to their general publicity. </para><para>I support and commend the work of the society in their efforts to reduce animal cruelty. They have as their creed the five freedoms for animals: freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; the right and freedom to express normal behaviour; and freedom from fear and distress. Campaigns in the past have all focused on those five points and on the society's objectives.</para><para>The society's concerns about the well-being of birds led it to be part of a 1994 report into the industry. In 1994 a working group which included the society made a recommendation which concluded that `no attempt be made to ban cage system egg production'. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy at the time, then Senator Bob Collins, said after the agreement was made that he was delighted at the outcome and pleased that both the industry and mainstream animal welfare interests supported the approach to ensure the welfare of layer hens.</para><para>Subsequently, the RSPCA was given an accreditation scheme for barn-laid eggs. So after the 1994 investigation and report all parties seemed satisfied with the outcome. The industry was happy with the code of conduct and so was the RSPCA. I am therefore somewhat puzzled as to why the RSPCA is now pursuing this very negative campaign against a legitimate Australian industry. Could it be that the RSPCA now lacks confidence in the existing legislation, then endorsed by all states and territories, governing hen production? Maybe so.</para><para>Dr Wirth said over the weekend that he was sure that 75 per cent of egg producers were doing the right thing, and I suspect the number is a lot higher. So it seems unlikely to me that this is the basis for the campaign. To be frank, if that was so, I would have expected the society's campaign to be targeted more towards the law-makers—the state and territory governments. But, instead, the society is hitting consumers and legitimate egg producers with a `buy barn-laid eggs' campaign—in other words, `Don't buy the eggs which just a couple of years ago were endorsed by the organisation.' So what other reason could there be? I wonder whether, in an industry 
 worth over $525 million in retail sales in 1997, there is some other gain to be made by the RSPCA in the promotion of barn-laid eggs?</para><para>We have a situation now where the RSPCA receives royalty payments from the commercial sale of barn-laid eggs. In fact, the royalty is said to be about 5c for every dozen eggs sold. Yet nowhere in this campaign, nowhere in the materials that have been sent to me, does the RSPCA make it clear that by supporting the increased demand for barn-laid eggs, consumers will in fact be contributing dollars in revenue to the RSPCA. Nowhere in the campaign package, in its media releases or even on its Internet site does the RSPCA acknowledge the monetary gain it is making from this campaign.</para><para>Yesterday, a week after the campaign began, Dr Wirth, the President, admitted somewhat reluctantly on ABC Radio that the society has a `vested interest because we of course get a royalty'. So there you have it. Dr Wirth has been calling for a `consumer-led revolution on behalf of these poor unfortunate chooks'. Now we have to ask: is this a genuine concern about animal welfare by the society or is it a covert attempt for competitive advantage in this industry?</para><para>Let us remember that around 200 million dozen eggs are produced in Australia each year, with 93 per cent coming from caged birds, two per cent from barn-house birds and five per cent from free-range birds. So if the RSPCA earns two per cent from the sale of barn-laid eggs, the organisation is getting around $200,000 a year in royalty payments. How many of these well-meaning consumers and the recipients of the campaign material know this? If, as the RSPCA wants, egg production by intensive means is banned, industry sources suggest that the price of a dozen eggs would increase by at least a dollar. If barn-laid and free-range eggs were to capture at least half that market, the RSPCA would then be in line for millions of dollars in royalties.</para><para>It seems to me that this publicity campaign is now very close to becoming a conflict of interest. Tonight I call on the RSPCA to publicly disclose this financial interest, to tell 
 us how much they have received in royalties from barn-laid eggs and to tell the Australian community why this interest was not disclosed in any of their publicity material and was not disclosed in all of the talkback radio interviews they have done over the last week. There is no doubt that the RSPCA is a credible community organisation with a very important role to play in the welfare of animals. But on this occasion it has just a few too many golden eggs in one basket and it has, at the least, been very tardy in its public disclosure.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Gordonstone Coalmine</title><page.no>2144</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2144</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on the situation at the Gordonstone mine in Queensland where the illegal sacking of 312 miners in October 1997 has resulted in a 16-month picket line which has now been maintained longer than any other in Australian coalmining history. The company which carried out the sackings, Arco, sold out to Rio Tinto late last year; now this company has continued along the same path. Picketers have clashed with Rio Tinto during the last week as it has attempted to bus in non-union labour to replace the illegally sacked workers.</para></talk.start><para>The situation at Gordonstone must be seen as irrefutable evidence of this government's approach to industrial relations being not just unfair and unjust but downright underhanded. The original owners of Gordonstone, Arco, carried out an open campaign to de-unionise coal workers, which culminated in the sacking of the 312 workers.</para><para>In February 1988 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission found that the dismissals had been unfair and ordered the company to pay compensation and also instructed Arco to give preference to former workers in the recruiting of their new work force. They found that the company had deliberately set out on an anti-union tack and also that the company was motivated by a desire to avoid its obligations under an enterprise agreement which it had entered into in 1996. Arco continually refused to employ the workers they had sacked, despite the rulings of the AIRC. Having failed to de-unionise 
 Gordonstone, they decided to sell to Rio Tinto.</para><para>Now Rio Tinto has stepped in where Arco left off. In December Rio Tinto commenced recruiting for the Gordonstone mine. The recruitment was carried out in secret and 23 hand-picked employees were engaged. The company, Mine Management, which recruited the work force, is a $2 shelf company which is a 100 per cent subsidiary of Rio Tinto. Some of those employed came from the Gordonstone management previously employed by Arco. These people accepted a non-union agreement that would cover all work at the mine by all employees for two years. The agreement overrides all existing obligations of any employer at the Gordonstone mine and was ratified on 2 February. The AIRC has no discretion when ratifying agreements under this government's legislation and union submissions were not allowed at the hearing.</para><para>Rio Tinto intends employing up to 200 workers under this certified agreement. No preference will be given to the former Gordonstone workers who were unlawfully dismissed by Arco. This government has therefore allowed these large multinationals to completely disregard and disrespect the authority of the AIRC. There seems to be absolutely no compulsion for these companies to abide by the commission's decisions, which is an utter disgrace.</para><para>The situation is made particularly ironic by the fact that the 312 workers that were sacked in 1997 were deemed to be among the most productive by international standards. Just months before the miners were illegally sacked, Arco had erected a statue to the Gordonstone work force describing them as `the best miners in the world' after they had broken a succession of international production records.</para><para>While the treatment of the Gordonstone miners has clearly been unfair from a vocational perspective, there are other aspects of the situation at Gordonstone that I find distinctly disturbing. This struggle has been maintained not just by workers but also by their families.</para><para>When I visited the area last year I saw significant evidence that Arco had been using intimidation and standover tactics to demoralise and upset miners and their families. Arco had employed a veritable private army of security guards to patrol the mine day and night. Furthermore, I heard other disturbing accounts of intimidation. The wives of several miners told me that they and their children had been intimidated on the streets of Emerald by members of Arco's private army. I am sure most people in our community would agree that the intimidation of women and children by multinational bullies should not be a part of the Australian approach to industrial relations. In fact, these actions are completely un-Australian. Is this the new flexible approach to industrial relations that the government wants us to embrace?</para><para>I have now been informed of several instances of violence by police against the passive demonstrators at Gordonstone in the past few days. Obviously, these people continue their struggle in relative isolation, with little sympathy from the government or law enforcement authorities. The waterfront scenes from last year are now being replicated at Gordonstone. Obviously, the federal government learned nothing from its conflict with the MUA last year and remains determined to crush the union movement in Australia, regardless of the implications for everyday Australians and their families. Is this the sort of industrial relations system we want to take with us into the new millennium? Is the bullying of women and children by multinational corporations acceptable behaviour in the 1990s?</para><para>It seems to me that, unless we act quickly, this government will turn the clock back to the 1900s and remove all the working standards and conditions that we have come to rely on in a civilised society. Perhaps computers are not the only ones confused by the millennium bug. Mr Howard does not seem to know which century he is in, either. The situation unfolding at Gordonstone can, therefore, be seen as a battle to defend the values and standards that prevail within the Australian community. The basic principles of 
 justice, equity and democracy are now at stake and we must all rally to defend them.</para><para>Democracy demands that all Australians enjoy freedom of association. This government is trying to take those basic rights away from unionists by allowing their families to be bullied and intimidated by multinational corporations. They have, therefore, failed in their duty of care to the Australian people. The ALP supports the miners and their families at Gordonstone. After all, their struggle is merely to protect their jobs and provide a decent living for their children, which is every Australian's right. It has always been every Australian's right to belong to a union and to work for decent wages and conditions. We are, after all, living in a democracy.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>2146</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.41 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2146</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2146</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Equity and diversity program—Health Insurance Commission—Report for 1997-98.</para><para>Safety Review Committee—Report for 1997-98.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2146</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Acts Interpretation Act—Statement pursuant to subsection 34C(6) relating to the extension of specified period for presentation of a report—Migration Agents Registration Authority Report for the period 21 March to 30 June 1998.</para><para>Australian National Training Authority Act—Determination No. 1 of 1999—Determination of Allowance for the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian National Training Authority.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>2147</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Isolated and Remote Students: Retention Rates</title><page.no>2147</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 16)</subtitle><id.no>16</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2147</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, 23 June 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Does the Government agree that retention rates for isolated and remote students at 51 per cent and for boys at 44 per cent in Year 12 are unacceptably low.</para><para>(2) What are the social and economic implications of such low rates for these young people and the families and communities from which they come.</para><para>(3) Will the Government consider increasing the basic boarding allowance (BBA) of the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) scheme to its original intent of 55 per cent of the average boarding fee; if not, why not.</para><para>(4) Is the Government aware that the average boarding fee in 1997 was $6 783.</para><para>(5) Will the Government consider increasing the second home allowance of the AIC scheme to achieve parity with the BBA; if not, why not.</para><para>(6) Will the Government consider tapering the means tested additional boarding allowance of the AIC scheme up to the average boarding fee when the parents have nil or negative income with small increases applying as family incomes rise, as proposed by the Isolated Children's Parents' Association (ICPA); if not, why not.</para><para>(7) When will the Government adopt the recommendations of the ICPA to:</para><para>(a) recognise that families subject to an asset test for AUSTUDY should not also be subject to an assets test on their income earning assets;</para><para>(b) subject to appropriate substantiation, treat wages paid to students from their family's company, partnership or trust in the same way as earnings from an outside employer or sole trader partner; and</para><para>(c) provide adequately trained staff to assist people with queries surrounding the complexity of the AUSTUDY application form.</para><para>(8) Will the Government honour its 1996 election promise to raise the discount on farms and small business income earning assets from 50 per cent to 75 per cent; if not why not.

They appear in the National Report on Schooling in Australia 1996. Completion rates express the number of Year 12 completions (that is, Year 12 certificates issued by State education authorities) as a proportion of the estimated population that could attend Year 12 in a particular calendar year.</para><para>It is true that completion rates for remote students are lower than students from both urban areas and non-remote rural areas, and that rates for boys are lower than for girls. The Government agrees that it is desirable for more students to complete Year 12.</para><para>(2) The Government acknowledges that there are established links between educational achievement and employment outcomes. The Commonwealth's concern for the education of students living in rural and remote areas of Australia is based on a need to ensure their equitable access to quality education which will assist them to achieve outcomes and participation rates at least equal to students in urban areas. To assist these students, the Government provides a number of programs that offer additional support and help. For example, the Commonwealth provides $17.7 million to State and 
 Territory government and non government education authorities annually to help schools and students in rural and remote areas of Australia. The Country Areas Program assist parents, administrators, teachers and other members of the community to work cooperatively to improve the delivery of primary and secondary school educational services in rural and geographically isolated areas.</para><para>(3) The Government increased the basic boarding allowance from $2,500 to $2,900 in the 1996-97 Budget. This brought the basic boarding allowance up to 55% of the average boarding fee. The Government has undertaken to further increase the basic boarding allowance from $2,900 to $3,500 and index this amount in future years. It also undertook to increase the maximum amount that can be received under a combination of the basic boarding allowance and additional boarding allowance to $4,347.</para><para>(4) The Isolated Children's Parents' Association's (ICPA) method of deriving an average boarding fee is a simple average of fees charged by all boarding institutions and gives undue weight to the level of fees at expensive boarding schools which have relatively few AIC beneficiaries. The Department's calculations are derived from the fees charged by boarding institutions at which AIC recipients are actually enrolled and weighted accordingly.</para><para>(5) There is not necessarily a connection between the second home allowance and basic boarding allowance. The basic boarding allowance was increased in the 1996 Budget from $2 500 per year to $2 900 per year per student in line with the Government's specific 1996 election commitment to increase the basic boarding allowance to 55% of the average boarding allowance. No evidence has been presented of increased costs faced by recipients of the second home allowance. While the value of the basic boarding allowance and the second home allowance may previously have been aligned, the government's initial concern was to provide additional help to those families who needed to board their children in a non-family environment.</para><para>(6) Firstly, no family should receive more than their actual boarding fee outlay. Secondly, the ICPA proposal does not acknowledge that low income families have access to a higher level of Family Payment which may be used by families to meet boarding costs.</para><para>(7) (a) AUSTUDY was replaced on 1 July by the Youth Allowance for students under 25 years of age and AUSTUDY payment for those aged 25 and over. Both programs are the responsibility of the Minister for Family and Community Services. Means test rules remain in general the same, with the exception that students classed as independent are no longer subject to an actual means test. The ICPA proposes that families applying for student 
 assistance should not be subject to an assets test on their income earning assets. As with AUSTUDY, only fifty per cent of the net value of income earning assets that are also business assets is taken into account under the Youth Allowance family assets test. The assets test is complemented by the Family Actual Means Test (FAMT), which is a test of expenditure and savings. Expenditure that was tax deductible in the previous financial year because it was necessarily incurred in carrying on a business is excluded from the FAMT.</para><para>(7) (b) Under the Youth Allowance Family Actual Means Test up to $6,000 of income earned from independent employment by students in a family aged 16 and over may be excluded. "Independent employment" is employment engaged in by a person that is not provided by a member of the person's family or by a proprietary company, an unlisted public company, a partnership or trust in which the person, or a member of the person's family, has an interest.</para><para>The exclusion relates to income from independent employment because the Government is concerned to ensure that only bona fide income earning activities are recognised. The Government considered that, to maintain the integrity of the FAMT, income earned should be restricted to employment outside family business structures.</para><para>(7) (c) The matter of providing Centrelink staff to assist people to complete student assistance claim forms on a question by question basis is one that should be taken up with Centrelink. Centrelink staff are trained in all aspects of Youth Allowance administration including, of course, the Family Actual Means Test.</para><para>(8) Prior to the 1996 election the Coalition made an undertaking to consider raising the AUSTUDY assets test discount for farm and other business assets to 75%. Given the high cost of implementing this measure (estimated at some $18.5 million in a full year) and the fiscal restraints faced after the election, the Government was unable proceed with this undertaking. The Government was concerned also about making AUSTUDY and more recently Youth Allowance available to families with unencumbered business assets of up to $1.63 million, at a time when public expenditure is under close scrutiny.</para><para>The value of the family residence and up to two hectares of surrounding land is exempt from the Youth Allowance assets test. A 50% discount is available on the value of farm and other business assets, which means that in 1998, children become ineligible for Youth Allowance under the assets test only when the family has unencumbered assets of the value of $814,500 or more.</para><para>Since 1 July 1998, when the main form of financial assistance to full time students became the 
 Youth Allowance for students between the ages of 16 and 24 and the new Austudy payment for students 25 and over, policy responsibility for these schemes has rested with the Minister for Social Security. The Youth Allowance and the Austudy payment have retained the range of concessions available to rural students under AUSTUDY, including the concessions for farming families suffering drought or other exceptional circumstances, and those for families with two or more tertiary students living away from home to study.</para><para>(9) These issues were considered in the development of the Youth Allowance. The Government considered that access to post-secondary education, even for students living in non-isolated areas, often involves living away from home. Under the Youth Allowance eligible students who have to live away from home may be entitled to rent assistance.</para><para>(10) Introduction of an allowance to isolated parents would have considerable cost implications and need to be considered by the Government in the Budget context.</para><para>While State and Territory governments have the primary role in the provision of education to school aged children, the Commonwealth assists geographically isolated families with students studying by distance education through the payment of the AIC distance education allowance. This allowance is intended to contribute toward incidental costs associated with distance education study. In the 1996 Budget, the Government announced a substantial increase to the Correspondence Allowance from 1997 and specific funding to State and Territory Governments for the purposes of extending services to rural and remote schools, as well as for technological innovations in distance education delivery. These initiatives are viewed as the fairest and most efficient means of addressing the educational needs of geographically isolated students.</para><para>The Commonwealth provides general recurrent funding for government school systems and non-government schools and systems. Non-government schools are funded on a needs basis and placed in one of 12 funding categories. Given these differential rates of funding, and as it is not possible to identify which schools the students schooled at home could attend, it is not possible to determine the saving to the Commonwealth where students are supervised and schooled at home by their parents.</para><para>(11) Consideration of this proposal would need to be in the Budget context. It should be noted that hostels which provide accommodation for government and non-government students are eligible, under the Commonwealth Capital Grants Program, for grants from the Government Component and Non-Government Component respectively of the Program.  
</para><para>Through its Schools Programs the Commonwealth provides recurrent funding for schools. Where boarding facilities are part of the school (ie. it is a boarding school) the assessment of the school's funding category through the Education Resources Index (ERI) takes boarding school costs into account. However, no ongoing recurrent funding is available for private hostels or other boarding arrangements.</para><para>The Commonwealth, through its General Recurrent Grants Program for schools, provides per capita assistance for government and non-government schools in respect of students attending those schools. This per capita funding assists schools with the recurrent costs of schooling like teaching and ancillary staff salaries, professional development of teachers, curriculum development, and school maintenance and general operation provisions. The current legislation governing the General Recurrent Grants Program does not envisage per capita payments to assist particular students with the costs of their schooling.</para><para>(12) The Department is aware of one non-government school approved for Commonwealth general recurrent grant funding that provided boarding facilities and which was located in a regional area outside the capital cities and other metropolitan centres, which closed in 1997. That school, which attracted funding at the category 9 level, reported 23 boarding students as at the 1997 schools census day. The Department does not maintain a specific, regular data collection in relation to low fee regional school term hostel closures and the number of places lost to these closures in the past twelve months.</para><para>(13) There are a number of schools offering boarding facilities in the area in which the closed school operated. These schools attract a comparable level of Commonwealth recurrent funding to that of the closed school. It would therefore be possible for students requiring boarding facilities to transfer to a similar environment. In line with its election commitment, the Government is providing short-term emergency funding to particular school term hostels in serious financial difficulty, while the Commonwealth sits down with the States to agree upon a significant long-term sustainable package for this sector.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Tax Office: Individual Taxpayer Audits</title><page.no>2149</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 157)</subtitle><id.no>157</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2149</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) How many audits have been undertaken by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) of individual taxpayers for the 1996-97 financial year with particular reference to: (a) the income matching

Due to the timing of the receipt of information from external organisations and the complexity of the required matching processes, discrepancies relating to the 1995-96 financial year were reviewed during the year ended 30 June 1998. Information relating to Interest &amp; Dividends and Rebates—refers to the 1995-96 financial year.</para><para>The number of audits undertaken in the 1995-96 financial is as follows:</para><para>Interest &amp; Dividends—103,428; Rebates—3,742.</para><para>(1) (b) There were 33,474 audits conducted, of these 21,261 cases required taxpayers to complete a questionnaire in the first instance. A number of these cases were then escalated to full substantiation audits depending on the details provided.</para><para>(1) (c) see table</para><para>(1) (d) It is uncertain what is meant by "real time audits". 7857 computer system checks were generated at the time returns were being processed. These cases identified potentially incorrect claims for family tax assistance, spouse and sole parent rebates.</para><para>(2) (a) (b) see table</para><para>(2) (c) The initial and subsequent amounts of tax are not available.</para><para>(2) (d) (e) (f) see table</para><para>(2) (e) See table**. The relationship between cases reviewed/audited and cases adjusted is often misinterpreted by extrapolating the rate to the wider community. This relationship needs to be viewed in the context of the type of audit or review program undertaken. For example, in relation to interest, dividends and rebates because cases are selected for review on the basis of information supplied by external institutions and then matched against information contained in tax returns, it is almost certain that errors have been made by taxpayers identified by this process, thus a high adjustment rate. On the other hand, in relation to work related expenses because most taxpayers were advised prior to lodging their tax returns of our intention to review their claims, more care was taken in preparing their returns and less errors were made.</para><para></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid"

Telstra also advises that, there has been one isolated case of a former staff member who expressed dissatisfaction with his contract with Telstra. Telstra maintains that the conditions of employment as advertised were identical to the actual conditions applying to the applicants during subsequent employment.</para><para>(2) Yes. Telstra advises that the advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</para><para>"The Rewards</para><para>Telstra offers a remuneration package consisting of base salary, incentive and superannuation commencing at $36,000 per annum depending on skills and experience".</para><para>Telstra further advises that successful applicants were also sent a letter before commencing that explained that 30 per cent of their package was commission based.</para><para>(3) Telstra advises that it believes that no discrepancy exists between the advertised conditions and those experienced by the successful applicants on taking up employment. Telstra has emphasised that the total package available to employees was higher than $36,000.</para><para>(4) Telstra advises that full details of the package as communicated to employees was:</para><para>Total package—$37,079.</para><para>Commission—$8,557; Total Employment Cost—$28,522; Super 5% of TEC—$4,278; Base—$24,244.</para><para>(5) See answer to Question (4). Telstra advises that differing terminology—"incentive" or "commission"- has been used to describe the payment to employees based on sales performance, with the amount being a percentage of Total Employment Cost.</para><para>(6) Telstra advises that individuals were advised prior to commencement of employment that the roles were sales based and there was a commission structure. Telstra further advises that the letter of offer clearly states a 70/30 package would be offered. The jobs were advertised as sales roles and as such are sales dependent. Telstra also advises that this was communicated at the initial interviews by the Business Sales Consultants Manager. 
</para><para>(7) Telstra considers that applicants were fully advised of the conditions of employment prior to commencement and that such conditions were in line with the information contained in the advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald.</para><para>(8) Under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, Telstra must submit AWAs to the Office of the Employment Advocate, not the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>Regrettably, an error in the processing of contracts by Telstra led to the AWAs not being submitted to the Employment Advocate as required under the Workplace Relations Act. Telstra advises that all AWAs were consequently withdrawn and re-submitted. There was no disadvantage to any employee as a result of this process.</para><para>(9) It is the role of the Telstra board and management, not government, to manage the day-to-day operations of the company, including staff salaries. I have sought no briefing on this specific issue additional to the advice provided in response to this question, and given the response provided by Telstra, I do not propose to do so.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Finance and Administration: Conference Expenditure</title><page.no>2153</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 213)</subtitle><id.no>213</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2153</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 25 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) What is the total expenditure on conferences both: (a) in-house, that is, held within the department or agency; and (b) external, held by the department or agencies within the portfolio, on a month-by-month basis since March 1996.</para><para>(2) For conferences fully funded by the department and portfolio agencies, and costing in excess of $30 000: (a) where was the venue; (b) what was the reason for each conference; (c) how many participants registered; (d) were consultancy fees paid for the organisation of each conference; (e) to whom were the consultancy fees paid; and (f) what was the cost of each consultancy.</para><para>(3) For conferences part-sponsored or part-funded by the department and portfolio agencies and costing the Commonwealth in excess of $30 000: (a) what was the cost to the department or agency; (b) what was the proportion of Commonwealth funding as against the total cost of the conference; (c) what was the rationale for the sponsorship or part-funding; (d) what was the venue; (e) how many participants registered; (f) did the Commonwealth contribute to any consultant organising the conference; if so, who was the consultant; and (g) how much was the Commonwealth's contribution.

As a guiding principle, FBT will not apply where the benefit is taxed under the Income Tax Assessment Act or is a return of contributed capital. In light of the proposal in A New Tax System to tax trusts like companies apart from certain excluded trusts, the income tax treatment of the types of trusts referred to in the question is a matter for consideration by the Review of Business Taxation which is being chaired by Mr John Ralph, A.O.</para><para>(2) As noted, as a guiding principle FBT will not apply where a benefit is taxed under the Income Tax Assessment Act (ITAA). Non-commercial loans made to private company shareholders are currently taxable under the ITAA and would 
 therefore not be subject to FBT under the proposed reforms. A New Tax System announced that provisions covering private company loans to shareholders would be extended to discretionary trusts and closely held fixed trusts. Consultation on this measure is being conducted through the Review of Business Taxation.</para><para>(3) (a) To attract the penalty provisions of the income tax law, a tax shortfall must arise because the taxpayer deliberately entered into a scheme to avoid tax, had failed to exercise reasonable care, was reckless, or had intentional disregard of the income tax law.</para><para>Therefore, unless an employee and their employer entered into an agreement to deliberately understate the reportable fringe benefits amount, or the employee ought reasonably have known that the fringe benefits amount was understated, no penalty would generally arise to the employee.</para><para>Where an assessment is amended, increasing the amount of tax payable, the employee would be liable for an interest penalty. There may be special circumstances where the Commissioner remits this amount.</para><para>For superannuation surcharge and termination payments surcharge purposes, an incorrect reportable fringe benefits amount shown on an employee's group certificate would not result in a penalty to the employee. Rather the surcharge liability in relation to the employee's contributions may be increased by virtue of an amended assessment, and interest would be payable on any increased liability.
