We have overcome the final obstacle in our negotiations with the government, that is, the conditions that will apply to the use of temporary employment in the Public Service. The government and the opposition have reached agreement on the regulations which will limit the use of temporary employment in the Australian Public Service. The opposition is pleased 
 that the government has now acknowledged that there need to be clear restraints on the use of lengthy temporary employment in the APS.</para></talk.start><para>Through amendments to the bill negotiated by the opposition the new act will enshrine the principle that the APS is a career based service with the usual basis for engagement being as an ongoing employee. This will be supported by a fair and transparent process relating to the termination of employees on specified grounds. The new act and associated regulations will therefore provide the framework for greater employment security in the APS.</para><para>We have achieved a substantial movement in the government's original position of wanting to be able to  engage people on a temporary basis for up to six years with little restraint. We now have a general limitation of 18 months on specified-term employment with some significant restraints on the ability to extend such employment up to three years. The revised regulations will permit persons to be employed for a specified term up to 18 months.</para><para>Under the proposed Public Service Commissioner's directions, engagement for longer than 12 months must be on the basis of merit. An employee engaged for a specified term for their particular skills or to replace an ongoing employee who is on extended leave or transfer may have their engagement extended up to a total of three years only if the original circumstance of their engagement continues to exist and the agency head has certified that it is in the public interest that their services be retained until the circumstance in relation to which they were engaged has ceased.</para><para>An employee engaged for a specified term related to a temporary increase in the workload of an agency which is not expected to be sustained may have their engagement extended up to a total of three years only if the increase in the workload is due to the implementation of a government policy that involves a temporary increase in the ongoing work of an agency. However, in both these circumstances involving extension of engagement up to three years, agency heads must be 
 able to demonstrate that they cannot manage the situation through the effective management of their ongoing work force. We believe this places a firm obligation on agency heads to have regard to the staff turnover within their agency to assess whether they can effectively manage the circumstances through the use of ongoing employees and subsequent redeployment to other jobs when those circumstances cease. In other words, there will be a strong incentive for agency heads not to waste the investment they make in training and skilling employees through a failure to maximise ongoing employment in the agency.</para><para>The government have stated that they want to `encourage employment under the new bill rather than resort to alternative and uncertain employment practices'. We share this objective and we urge the government to pursue it by directing agency heads to use the employment categories in the new act and phase out the use of `independent contractors' and `labour hirees'. The opposition will closely monitor the operation of the new provisions to ensure that they are appropriately applied. I am sure that the CPSU will also be vigilant in keeping agency heads honest in using the new temporary employment arrangements. We would expect that there would be no increase in the proportion of the APS work force engaged on a temporary basis. Employment security is fundamental to all employees in both the public sector and the private sector. The improvements that we have negotiated to the bill and the associated regulations will lessen the current high level of job insecurity evident in the APS. That has been an important principle as far as the opposition is concerned.</para><para>In conclusion, I take this opportunity to reiterate that, since we entered into these negotiations with the government, it has been our objective to achieve a legislative framework for the Public Service which will endure beyond the term of the Howard government. We wanted a framework that would be equally acceptable to a future Beazley Labor government, a framework that would encourage continuity, stability and certainty—all of which we believe are essential prerequisites for an effective and thriving Public Service. 
 We are confident that the legislative package that we now have before us and the regulations that will be brought forward by the government in due course achieve those objectives.</para><para>In view of our agreement with the government on the last remaining obstacle in our negotiations—the regulations which will govern the use of temporary employment in the Public Service—we will be supporting the government in moving that the chamber not insist on its amendments to the Public Service Bill and the Parliamentary Service Bill. I think it is appropriate in this circumstance that the minister at the table, Senator Ellison, representing the Public Service minister, Dr Kemp, acknowledges that the description I have given of the agreement that we have reached on these regulations on temporary employment is completely consistent with the government's own understanding of the situation. In the event that that acknowledgment is given by the minister, we will see very significant reform occurring today to the Public Service Act of this country which, as I have indicated, will stand in good stead for many years to come.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>9997</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset I acknowledge Senator Faulkner's comments and the position as he has outlined it. This legislation provides a careful balance between devolved responsibility and approved accountability. In developing the bill, the government has negotiated in good faith with the opposition in recognition of their position as an alternative government and has sought reasonable compromise and bipartisan support.</para></talk.start><para>Before the bill was debated in this chamber last week, agreement had been reached on amendments to the bill which were acceptable to the government and the opposition, with one exception. The circumstances under which agency heads would be able to engage non-ongoing employees was a matter of contention. The government was unable to accept the Senate amendment to clause 22. Since that debate there have been continued negotiations between the government and the opposition, and also consultation with the 
 Community and Public Sector Union, about the circumstances in which people can be employed on that basis.</para><para>I take the opportunity to reiterate what I said last week during the debate on this bill—namely, that the government has appreciated the positive approach taken by the opposition. Negotiations have continued in the spirit of goodwill and with the intention of developing a realistic and workable alternative approach. Agreement has now been reached on the use of non-ongoing employment in the APS, and I would like to place on the record how the new employment arrangements are expected to operate.</para><para>Clause 22 of the bill allows an agency head to engage employees in one of three categories—ongoing, for a specified term or a specified task and for duties that are irregular or intermittent—while recognising that the usual basis for engagement is as an ongoing employee. Regulations will limit the circumstances in which persons may be engaged as a non-ongoing employee for a specified term or for the duration of a specified task. Agency heads will have the flexibility to engage persons for a specified term of up to 18 months to meet a temporary increase in workload in the agency or part of the agency, to meet a temporary demand for particular skills, or to replace an ongoing employee who is on leave or undertaking other duties.</para><para>Provided that the original reason for engagement still exists, agency heads will be able to extend the engagement of an employee engaged to meet a temporary demand for particular skills or to replace an ongoing employee for up to a maximum of three years if they certify that it is in the public interest to do so. Agency heads will also be able to extend engagements undertaken because of a temporary increase in workload, if the reason for the engagement still exists, to a maximum of three years if the increase is due to the implementation of government policy. This reflects the nature of government, where programs often have a two- to three-year lifespan. Before extending the engagement of an employee engaged for a specified term to replace an ongoing employee who is on leave, temporarily assigned to other duties or moved 
 temporarily to another agency, an agency head will need to ensure that there is no scope to use their existing ongoing work force to cover the temporary work increase, the demand for skills, or the replacement of ongoing employees.</para><para>In addition, the employment of an employee engaged for a specified term can only be extended in circumstances where the agency head cannot manage the temporary increase in workload, the demand for particular skills or the need to replace APS employees through the use of the agency's ongoing work force. Agency heads may also engage persons for the duration of a specified task when the service of the person will no longer be needed once the task has been completed, provided that existing staff members have the opportunity to express interest and be considered. There are no time limits for this category as it is linked to the length of time needed to complete the specific task. This flexibility means that the agency head is able to determine the nature and extent of the task to be performed. The regulations will also allow agency heads to employ persons for the purposes of gaining employment experience.</para><para>To ensure that there is transparency in decision making, service-wide employment schemes will be specified in a Prime Minister's direction under section 21 of the bill, and agency-specific schemes will need to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> by agency heads. The regulations will also provide that a person who has been offered ongoing employment may choose to be engaged as a specific-term employee for a period of up to three years. This recognises that some people, often professionals, may wish to work in the APS only for a short period, and also provides an employment option for people on a secondment or interchange to the APS from overseas organisations, academia and the public and private sectors who might wish to retain their main employment relationship. This obviously provides some flexibility. The government considers that this framework provides the flexibility agency heads require to meet their operational needs, while ensuring transparency and accountability in relation to the engagement of non-ongoing APS employees. I 
 commend these bills—and the motion in particular—to the Senate, confirm the arrangements as outlined by Senator Faulkner and once again place on record the appreciation of the government in relation to the cooperation showed to it by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>9998</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate that the Democrats do not support this move to not insist on the amendments. We did, generally speaking, support the agreement as struck between the Labor Party and the government. However, there were within that significant compromises. In our view, this is an important principle and compromises too far on what were very significant changes in relation to employment on a temporary basis. We heard no real arguments to support this extension from the current arrangement of 12 months to 18 months, just as there were no good arguments to support the extension to a maximum of six years. There is already, as I understand it, within the Public Service a great deal of employment that goes on on a temporary basis and great nervousness about employing people beyond 12 months. This will set in train a further exacerbation of what I see as a problem. It is reflected beyond the Public Service, of course. The casualisation of the work force has been identified many times in this place as being a bad thing. It seems to the Democrats that extending this period within which public servants can be employed on a temporary basis is a move in the wrong direction, so we will not be supporting this move.</para></talk.start><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

 1996. Immediately upon taking up office, in its 1996 budget this government cut $350 million to public education and private schooling was deregulated. In 1997 equity programs were abandoned. In 1998, despite increased numbers in public schools, the enrolment benchmark adjustment took effect. That stole $11.9 million from public schools to pay for increased enrolments in private schools. In 1999 around $800 extra per child for private schools by the year 2003, and only around $100 extra for public schools, was injected into this country's education. Also, the enrolment benchmark adjustment takes a further $21 million from public schools.</para></talk.start><para>In the last 3½ years we have seen $800 million in total lost from public education under the Howard government. When Prime Minister John Howard came to office, there was 54c in recurrent expenditure going to public schools for every dollar that went to a private school. It is now unbelievable and quite clearly a measure of injustice that this amount has been reduced to 42c, equalling a total loss of $800 million.</para><para>But some would argue that Minister Kemp has another agenda and that it has been revealed quite clearly in the last fortnight. In respect of his plan for higher education, we notice that, as of Monday, there is still on the table an attack on the unions within the education arena in higher education and that he continues that attack on unions in the public education arena. He explained in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 13 May this year that the budget was `part of a wider strategy'. He went on to say the ability to support choice is, from the Commonwealth government's point of view, `a major driver for reform' in the government sector. The plan is to provide a competitive environment which will force the state education ministers to `push ahead with the reform process and stop being intimidated by unions'.</para><para>With that effect, I assume he is meaning the Australian Education Union or even the Independent Education Union. Again, he continues with his obsession about what he believes is a dominance by the trade union movement of the education sector, not only by the AEU but also by the NTU in the 
 higher education arena. That is a claim that, of course, cannot be legitimatised, given that this week there has been a negotiated settlement, for example, in the Northern Territory for a 10 per cent wage increase without, I declare, any intimidation by the unions and without any industrial action but with a concerted campaign of negotiation.</para><para>The equity concept has been abandoned. Equity programs targeted to assist the poorest and most disadvantaged of our children were established 20 years ago after a significant struggle by parents and teachers. The money, which totals $170 million, from these programs has been transferred to literacy support, an important priority, but it should not be at the expense of guaranteed support across all areas of need.</para><para>Public schools in this country struggle with a $2 billion deficit and are now seriously underfunded. Nationally, we face a deficit of at least $2 billion in that sector. The increased burden on parents and the community to make up the difference through voluntary contributions, such as fundraising and sponsorship, is clearly an unacceptable move on behalf of this government in respect of the way in which it treats public education.</para><para>Federal and state governments must accept the responsibility to fully fund public education. Federal and state ministers are responsible for $4.6 million missing from their budgets. In the early eighties Australia spent 3.6 per cent of GDP on schools; in 1995-96 Australian governments only spent 2.7 per cent, so we have seen over the years a decrease in the commitment of money that we actually spend on education. That flies in the face of us wanting to be a skilled country, a knowledgeable country, a country that can in fact contribute, through the learning outcomes of our people and workers, towards the economy and turnover.</para><para>Federal and state governments must accept, I believe, that investment in schools must increase dramatically, with the initial target being to meet the $2 billion. This can only be done in partnership, and therefore state and federal governments in particular should feel responsible for the absolute neglect we have seen in our public school system since 1996.</para><para>In finishing, I believe you should be left in no doubt as to why earlier this year parents and teachers launched a campaign to demand that this federal government, as a first step, put into the budget the $800 million that it has taken from public schools through a loss in parity over the past four years. In June this year, parents and teachers together launched a campaign titled, `Public school children deserve a fair share' with a press release jointly launched by the Australian Education Union's Federal President Sharan Burrow and Mr Ian Morgan, the President of ACSSO, which is the Australian Council of State School Organisations. Mr Morgan said, `Every coalition politician in Australia has a responsibility to deliver equitable, quality education to the whole of Australia.' He went on to say that he felt:</para><para>The 1999/2000 budget is an attack on public schools and a windfall for the private sector.</para><para>He said students in private schools would receive nearly $800 extra funding each on top of the government's already generous funding of the private sector. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>10000</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will not oppose the bill that is before us today, the <inline ref="r885">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999</inline> . However, we believe public schools will get very little out of the budget measures implemented by these amendments. These allocations for the year 2000 include $36.3 million for the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and $26.4 million for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy. I note that these amounts are somewhat lower than the allocations set out in the May budget papers. In May NALSAS was to receive $30 million, so $3.6 million is somehow missing. The literacy initiatives were to receive $41 million, which means that a little under $5 million has gone. This is hardly surprising given Dr Kemp's habit of making funding figures look far more glamorous than they actually are and of disguising inflation and indexation as new additional funding.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also provides for an extra $1.9 million in short-term emergency assistance for non-government schools, and this is to smooth 
 over difficulties experienced by disadvantaged schools in the transition to the new SES funding model. I will discuss that model a little later. Lastly, capital grants for non-government schools will be increased by $10.1 million to maintain them at the real levels prevailing from 1997 to 1999. I welcome the inclusion in the budget of national teacher professional development through the Quality Teacher Program, but I also note its absence in this bill.</para><para>We note that this is an emaciated version of the professional development program abolished in 1996. Teacher development is now valued at a total of $77 million over four years compared with $45 million every year between 1993 and 1996. It is funny that a government intent on withdrawing money from schools and blaming teachers for poor literacy outcomes should want to devote fewer resources to their development. Senator Carr has pointed out that only $15 million has been legislated for, but not the remaining $62 million for the following three years.</para><para>There is nothing in this states grants bill to address the needs of large numbers of alienated youth. There is nothing for learning difficulties. The impact of the Common Youth Allowance has been somewhat surprising. On the basis of the DETYA figures, schools groups anticipated an increase for Victoria of between 2,000 and 3,000 16- and 17-year-olds compelled to return to school in order to keep receiving the allowance. According to a recent survey by the Australian Education Union, 22 per cent of schools had unusual enrolment increases in 16- and 17-year-olds. The actual numbers of returning students were small.</para><para>These young people do exist: 15,000 exemptions were granted nationally in March this year. The reasons included substance abuse, learning difficulties, homelessness, incapacity, caring responsibilities, pre- and post-natal, and community service and juvenile justice orders. It appears that we have lost many young people well before they have turned 16 or 17.</para><para>It would have been a pleasant surprise to see some federal initiative on teacher shortages in this bill. I am told that the Queensland and Western Australian education departments 
 are trying to recruit teachers from Europe, the US and South Africa. This is certainly a turnaround from the responses that I received when I wrote to state ministers last year. They all denied that there was a problem. I eagerly await the forthcoming Preston report on teacher shortages. Unlike last year, this report has been compiled with the assistance of the states. Hopefully it will spur some federal action, too.</para><para>The section of this bill that allocates transitional funding to non-government schools in readiness for the new SES funding model should remind us that a sea change is about to occur in schools funding. It is the legislative debut of the SES model. In itself, this debut is of marginal importance—$1.9 million in transitional funding for the neediest non-government schools. While the Democrats have significant problems with this model, which has not yet been set, we will not be opposing this small allocation of money.</para><para>We are very fortunate that cabinet has rejected Dr Kemp's plan for deregulation of university fees and a voucher system. There was, quite rightly, a public outcry at Dr Kemp's ambitions for a two-tiered tertiary education system. Unfortunately, Dr Kemp has a similar free market revolution in mind for secondary schooling. Dr Kemp has remarked that he envisages a future `where distinctions between government and non-government schools will become outdated and increasingly irrelevant'. Yet the beginnings of this revolution have largely escaped the outcry that accompanied the elite blueprint for universities.</para><para>First, Dr Kemp introduced the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment. The formula works by taking money away from the public system if the proportion of non-government enrolments rises in a given year. Even if the actual numbers of enrolments are rising in both sectors, money gets taken out of the public system. My calculations show that, between now and 2007, public schools stand to lose $121 million through the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment.</para><para>But the new SES model threatens to trigger far larger losses to the public system. Non-government schools will be allowed to raise 
 any amount of money they like without this being taken into account when their level of funding is calculated. Elite schools will be treated no differently than the poorest Catholic schools. The government promised that no school, no matter how wealthy, would be worse off. In effect that means only a small percentage of schools will have their funding determined by the SES model. So much for a newer, fairer formula. The government has, from the word go, decided that the formula on its own is not good enough. The promise to the Catholic schools to fund them all at the former category 11 has no equity rationale at all as far as I can see. As we know, Catholic schools vary enormously in terms of the fees that they charge, their location and the socioeconomic status of students.</para><para>Dr Kemp's free market model is far from needs based, and the Democrats have a problem with this. We would rather see more money go to the neediest non-government schools instead of throwing more money at schools that are already wealthy. At many non-government schools, spending per student is something of the order of $13,000 per annum, including state and federal grants, fees and the like, whereas the cost for a secondary student in the public system is around $6,000—less than half the amount spent on moderately well-off private schools.</para><para>I am disappointed that the opposition have seen fit not to support our amendment to their second reading amendment condemning the government for quarantining wealthy schools from the needs based funding model. It is one thing to be cynical of Dr Kemp's literacy hoax and to call for increases in funding to government schools, but the ALP have completely nobbled themselves when it comes to attacking the heart of Dr Kemp's agenda, which is to prop up the private system at the expense of the public system. We are talking about fair distribution of funding within the non-government sector, and that will not happen under the government's SES model. How the ALP can ignore this equity question is beyond me. In the view of the Democrats, it is time for Dr Kemp to look at educational and outcome guarantees rather than affluence 
 guarantees—and I think that is what is represented in this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>10002</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r885">States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999</inline>  proposes to implement some of the government's undertakings from the 1999-2000 budget. The measures provide additional spending of $36.3 million for the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and for literacy improvement strategies for the middle years of schooling, and $26.4 million to extend funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategy in the year 2000.</para></talk.start><para>Other measures include $10.1 million annually for the years 2000-03 to maintain funding for the non-government component of capital gains programs at the same level as 1997-99 and to provide an additional $1.9 million for Short Term Emergency Assistance for 2000 to allow schools which are experiencing severe financial hardship or facing problems of viability to apply for STEA during the transitional period to the new SES funding for non-government schools, to make minor technical amendments to the headings in the act and to change the name of the literacy program to the Literacy and Numeracy Program. We support those measures; they are a very small contribution on the part of this government to an increase in education funding.</para><para>Measure that against the government's record on funding for education. In the almost four years they have been in office, they have slashed something in the order of $2 billion from education funding. These government cuts include: a total of $961.59 million taken out of higher education and university funding; a reduction in discretionary funding—$215 million; a reduction in operating grants to universities—$623.54 million; the phased abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme—$67.4 million; abolition of the Merit Based Equity Scholarships scheme—$38.9 million; and a reduction in the Higher Education Innovation Program—$16 million.</para><para>With regard to HECS, there have been increased charges in the differential rates, 
 removal of $313 million of federal funding and the lowering of the repayment threshold again, taking away $817 million from students—a total of $1,130.41 million. Other cuts include: vocational education and training—$242.47 million; student assistance in a range of measures that were previously in place—$536 million; the cessation of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy—$14½ million in 1996; cessation of the schools incidental allowance for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy—$11 million in 1997; raising the age of independence for Austudy from 1 January 1997, which cut out $241 million; tightening of the means test, further reducing funding by $185 million; introduction of a two-year waiting period for Austudy for newly arrived migrants—$43.95 million; reduction in the maximum rent assistance payable to singles in shared accommodation, which took effect from 1 July 1997—$730,000; and a further saving in improved targeting. It is called improved targeting, but that is a matter for debate.</para><para>Against that, we know that this government, having slashed some $2 billion in funding for education, has a plan to further slash funding. We know that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, proposed to do a range of things in his cabinet submission, including the deregulation of fees in universities. We know what that would have cost because we have already seen the example of a Melbourne university that is already charging around $72,000 for degrees. We know that he proposed to introduce vouchers for use in public and private institutions and a loan scheme with commercial interest rates. We know the government was planning to do those things. The Prime Minister tried to say that was simply not true, but the fact of the matter is that a cabinet minister does not prepare a submission to cabinet without some discussion with his cabinet colleagues. He has apparently gone through a process where there have been a number of discussions to develop this submission to the point where it would have become reality. </para><para>The very reason the Australian public should not trust the government is that we have seen on a number of occasions already when they have said they would not do certain things—we had the never-ever GST but we have got that, and that is a further impost for people in the education system—they have turned around and done exactly the opposite. This submission to cabinet is a plain example of that.</para><para>The minister, Dr Kemp, would also have us believe that, somehow, he discovered literacy and numeracy; nobody else had ever done anything about that before he arrived on the scene—he is the sole crusader for literacy in Australia. The fact of the matter is that in 1994 Labor in government set up a literacy survey under the Working Nation plan. That was the first national survey in schools to collect data on how children in years 3 and 5 were performing in the key areas of reading and writing. The study was called the National Schools English Literacy Survey. We provided some $17 million in 1995-96 for the Early Literacy program.</para><para>The states have also undertaken their own initiatives both individually and collectively to provide for adequate literacy levels among schoolchildren. The Commonwealth, state and territory education ministers agreed to a national literacy goal in March 1997. The goal was to ensure that appropriate steps were taken to provide every child leaving primary school with adequate numeracy and literacy levels. The interesting thing about this is that the minister's own state colleagues did not include him in the process. His own state Liberal colleagues—and this is back in 1997—in Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland went out of their way to distance themselves and called on him to cease his political stunt. His comments on <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline>, even though they were in 1997, showed that he tried to score a political point from the work of others. Anyone who follows this issue would know about Dr Kemp's attempts to mislead Australian parents about literacy levels by shamelessly manipulating the results of the National Schools English Literacy Survey. Of course, this was recently covered by <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>. On that program, the now former 
 minister for education in Victoria, Mr Phil Gude, said of Dr Kemp that he was deliberately and mischievously `manipulating data to portray literacy levels at a perilous level'.</para><para>One of the other measures in this bill is the extension of funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools strategies. This was one of our initiatives when we were in government. This is a program that we instigated, and this minister is trying to take the credit for it. Again, we support the measures proposed in the bill, because it is a very small improvement in terms of funding for education. But, as I said before, this government has severely slashed funding over the course of its almost four years in government and had planned to do that even further.</para><para>I suppose when you analyse that in terms of a commitment to education, we really need to look at what we are actually spending on education in terms of a percentage of gross domestic product. Since this government has been in power it has declined. When we were last in government, spending on education was around three per cent of GDP; it is now down to 2.3 per cent. Of course, the government would try to convince us that, somehow, it has provided for more university places and that things are all rosy and are being improved, but the reality is entirely different. I suspect the minister and the Prime Minister certainly saw that with the reaction they got when the leaked cabinet submission hit the deck. The students, the parents of students and the parents of potential students are certainly not very happy, and I guess that that is the only reason the Prime Minister, being the person that he is, said that Dr Kemp's cabinet submission was not going to become a reality.</para><para>But the leopard never changes his spots. This Prime Minister gave commitments to the public of Australia about other things and then turned around after elections and did exactly the opposite. This is not unlike what we have seen in another area, where we have a minister in this place dealing with welfare issues who also does not have a cabinet submission, I do not think—although we may find that out ultimately—but at least has some 
 hidden green paper about welfare. I suspect what they plan to do for the future. That should be of great concern to the Australian public, because they have done nothing really to develop initiatives to help either poor people or improve the education standards of this country.</para><para>Whilst we get all of the rhetoric from the Prime Minister—and it is rhetoric that should be backed up by action and support—it is important to this country that education is supported, because it is from that base that we provide for the future. We do have to be a smarter country, and therefore it is important that we have the right sort of investment and the right levels of investment in education in the future to ensure that we stay ahead of the game. As we go down the road of globalisation of the economies of various countries and we move into the era of a greater and freer trade system, it is important, because we are a small country in terms of population, to maximise the opportunities that we have. Education and the provision of education services is one of them.</para><para>In developing our technologies, et cetera, we need to ensure that the people who go through the education system have the right support and the right opportunities provided to them. We cannot continue to rely on the things that we have in the past. That is a fact. We have to be smarter. We have to go more into manufacturing and, again, this is another area where this government has failed dismally. We just have not had the right initiative and the right drive from this government in heading the country in the direction it ought to be going, in terms of the population size that we have to compete in the world marketplace. If we do not do that, if we do not see some turnaround in that, then we are going to confront major problems.</para><para>As I said, despite the claims of the government, expenditure on education is now down to 2.3 per cent and going down—and the plan was to make it go down even further. How does that sit with the need for us to improve our education system? If we look at some of the other areas in the government's 1999-2000 budget, there is an equity issue in the funding for public schools—the schools that 
 cater for the less well off—versus the funding for private schools. The government increased funding for private schools, and there is nothing wrong with that, but they gave nothing to the schools that almost 70 per cent of children attend. That is the problem. If you are going to give funding for schools, then you ought to give it equitably. Private schools received an increase of $210 a year per student, which is 21 times greater than what is received per student by public schools. As I said before, the 1999 budget abolished the merit based equity scholarships for university students from poorer families, rural families and families of non-English speaking backgrounds. Where do we stand in providing opportunities to go to university for those people who are less well off or who are isolated?</para><para>In May this year, just before the budget, the Prime Minister did an interview with Neil Mitchell on Radio 3AW. He was asked, `What sort of budget will it be?' and the Prime Minister answered:</para><para>I think very much a budget about the education future of this country. I think you will find quite a bit in it about education.</para><para>We did, but it was not good for education. He went on to say:</para><para>I think it will be a theme that will be very good for education and what I might call the future intellectual capital of this country.</para><para>If that is the sort of investment you are going to make in the future intellectual capital of this country, you would not want the Prime Minister making other investments for you, because you would not do too well.</para><para>Then we come back to Dr Kemp's cabinet submission. That really points out what sort of investment we are going to make in the future intellectual capital of this country. We are going to make it even tougher for people, particularly those who are less well off, to get an education. For example, the American universities Yale and Stanford charge fees of around $A37,000 a year, while a private university in Melbourne has just announced the introduction of a two-year post-graduate law course at a cost of $72,000. That is just a forerunner to what we could expect to see under Dr Kemp's new regime—the education 
 reform that he says is essential. It is very clear from the leaked cabinet submission what Dr Kemp intended for education in the future of this country. Under the heading `Imperatives for Reform' it states:</para><para>The government has committed itself to education being a major theme of its second term.</para><para>It states further:</para><para>Good education policies will have major benefits in terms of jobs, wealth creation, social inclusion, cultural dynamism and intellectual creativity.</para><para>I do not know how we are going to get that if we are talking about a significant further reduction in funding—and that is on top of the $2 billion that we have already had.</para><para>While we are supporting some of the measures in this bill, we condemn the government very seriously for the cuts they have made to the education system of this country. They have made it more difficult for people to get an education, and it is going be more difficult in the future for people to get an education and to assist this country to become the smarter nation we need to be to compete in world terms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>10005</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a couple of comments about literacy, but, before I do, I want to say that I think the argument about who is getting what in terms of the education cake is an important one and it needs to by fully investigated.

 the provision of education in this country is that the outcome at the other end sometimes is disappointing. I think it is disappointing because what you find is that governments are prepared to fund education to a certain level. They will fund 80 or 90 per cent of that education budget, but they will not fund what is necessary to address some of the obvious problems, and those are, primarily, literacy and numeracy.</para><para>I send my kids to state schools. I must say they get a good education; I am satisfied with the school they go to. One is in kindy and next year will go to the same school that the other two go to. The school provides a good balanced educational service. The problem is that, when it comes down to actually finding the dollars to help with some of the literacy issues, that school unfortunately is reduced to the level of being a pauper. It is in a basically poor area and, as a consequence of that, it needs added resources.</para><para>The way this is done in my state, and I am sure it is the same in most other states, is that schools go out and, through various fundraising activities and other sometimes more entrepreneurial activities, raise several thousands of dollars every couple of months. In some instances, some of the state schools in the more affluent suburbs raise tens of thousands of dollars every couple of months, and in fact add to whatever the education program is by soaking the parents and the local community out of moneys. Really, in essence, we are paying our taxes to achieve these outcomes and using these resources so that our kids can get the necessary programs.</para><para>In the school that my kids go to, there is firm competition amongst a lot of students for very meagre resources. Those resources are provided by the state and the school. They are provided to teach kids better literacy, to bring in programs and to provide teacher time—sometimes one on one, sometimes one to a group of kids. For a child to actually get onto this program, a whole number of steps have to be gone through. It is the case that, at the end of all these steps, the funding is not necessarily secure. There are a few other problems which have nothing to do with this minister and this government. They are to do 
 with the state government in South Australia—and I am sure it is the same in some of the other states—and how they address these problems or, in fact, do not address these problems.</para><para>Senator Murphy said that the first national literacy standard in this country was carried out in 1994. If that is correct—and I am sure Senator Murphy is right—then I am absolutely shocked at that. If I went to similar OECD countries, I would find that we are 20 years or more behind on that particular issue. I think if we were to assess adequately the outcome at the end of primary school, we would find that we would be lagging well behind other OECD countries. I think one of the problems with this is that it is a bit like going down to the car yard and buying a nice new car without a radio, a heater, doorhandles or anything else. We provide a large amount of money for education, but then we do not take the extra couple of steps to provide a bit more to help in some of the areas, particularly in respect of some of the students who need that assistance.</para><para>I know that about six years ago in South Australia schools in Elizabeth—we called it the peachy road belt—raised by their own voluntary means about $1,800 a year. That is all they could raise from parents and friends who would come to the many gala days and whatever other activities they held in their communities. In the area that I represented at that time, as the state member for Playford, the average amount raised was somewhere between $6,000 and $8,000, so it was a more affluent area. But when I then went into the eastern suburbs, I found that some of the schools there were getting $50,000, and that was not an unrealistic figure at all. So, naturally, in the eastern suburbs, where literacy was less of a problem because of the educational level of parents, I found that the bulk of the resources that was being raised voluntarily was going in precisely the areas where it should not have been going.</para><para>Governments, both state and federal, will probably come back to me and say that they had the PEP program, this program or that program, but at the end of the day they only ever covered a small proportion of what the 
 real need was. So far I have talked only about primary education; I am going to talk about secondary education in just a minute. I think what is required is an adequate level of funding to take us to the next step. One would suggest that some of the private schools already have an adequate level of funding to achieve this and other goals. It is certainly true that in South Australia, the Pulteney Grammar School, in particular, has an excellent program for the first couple years of schooling to make sure that those children who are not picking up the literacy and numeracy standards are identified and in fact catered for and the outcomes are very good.</para><para>Of course, Pulteney Grammar is one of Adelaide's best schools; it is also one of the most expensive. I see the Acting Deputy President disagrees with me; I know he is an old Scotch boy. I do not know very much about Scotch but, having being a graduate of Elizabeth High School, I must say that what I know about these schools is what I have picked up over the years both since I left teaching and professionally when I did teach in both systems. But not every private school is in the same category as Pulteney Grammar School. There are a large number of private schools—I think in my day when the funding formula was different to what it is today they were category D and E schools—at least in South Australia. That meant there was a struggle: a struggle for parents to meet those fees and a struggle for the school to even survive. In fact, in many of these schools the class sizes were actually larger than they were in the state schools further down the road and the level of resources was considerably less.</para><para>The level of education and what we achieve are going to determine what we will be in the 21st century. It is a national problem. It needs to be addressed not only at the state government level but at the national government level. We need to make sure that we get the best possible outcomes for our money and that they match those of our OECD partners.</para><para>We need to make sure that two premises are followed in respect of primary school literacy, numeracy and other programs. The first is that we have an adequate level of funding to address the problem. That certainly is not the 
 case anymore. If it ever was the case—and I doubt that—it certainly is not now. The other very important premise is that we need to put the money where the problems are. I suspect that has been poorly directed. Despite all of the equity programs that I have seen, very few of them seem to work very well. Very few of them seem to target real need because, in essence, not only do you have very poor schools but you also have some very poor students in some of the more affluent areas, particularly in some of the more affluent areas that I could name here now in the capital cities and in regional Australia as well. As a consequence of that, an adequate level and support of resources for literacy and numeracy programs in particular in our schools is long overdue.</para><para>I want to make a point in terms of secondary education. I will not take long on this because I have raised this matter here before. In my home state there is talk of actually bringing back the teaching of history in schools. It disappeared because education departments and their bureaucracies found it easier to use words such as `society and environment', `social sciences' and `social studies'. Many years ago a bureaucrat said to me, `Look, John, it is like this: you can call it that and then you can shove up any teacher you have got spare at that time who has done anything in that area—who has done anything at all, even a science graduate—and they can entertain the masses for the necessary 40-minute lesson block.' That is what has happened and we have paid a price for that.</para><para>We have also paid a price for the fact that we do not concentrate on English and some of the humanities that require accurate language skills. That accuracy of language skills traverses the whole range of professional development in this country. If people cannot read and write properly or at a sufficiently adequate level to enable them to carry out their jobs, then it impacts on their particular life and, more importantly, it takes from the skills that are desperately required in a whole range of different endeavours in our economy. Obviously, a person with ability to write good, precise English argument is an essential person in a whole range of different profes 
 sions in this country. That is never more so than in the 21st century. Yet, in secondary schools there was a greater concentration 20 years ago than there is today on courses which taught those disciplines in my home state, and I know it is the same in other states.</para><para>The sequential development of literacy skills in secondary education is essential. The teaching of English, the teaching of history and even the teaching of other related disciplines that require precise written argumentation and the development of that skill have been under assault over about the last 20 years. I would hope that that is reversed. That is also a national problem that needs to be addressed and needs resources to address it. It also requires education authorities to see the problems and do something about them, and not just go along with fashionable developments that may suit them in the short run.</para><para>This  States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  is about satisfying the government's desire to put a level of resource that they feel comfortable with into primary and secondary education in this country. It is not enough. The measurement of outcomes is not adequate and I think some national priorities and some national perspectives on this need to be discussed with the various state education agencies. Even with just some discussion we could get some better outcomes than we have had. This bill is an admission in a sense that we are making very slow progress. We need to make much more dramatic progress into the next century. In particular, the minister has made a number of comments particularly about literacy in this country. If he is serious, he has to see that as a whole-of-school education problem. He has to put the resources in there. He has to achieve some of the goals that I think are necessary to establish some of the benchmarks and to go out there and make sure that we are getting the very best for the dollars that we are spending.</para><para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline>) proposed:</para><para>At the end of the amendment, add:</para><para>"; and (c)	  selectively applying its new funding formula for non-government schools with the result that the wealthiest

I indicate to the Senate that the opposition has expressed its very grave concern about the declining level of real funding support going to public education in this country. We have said that the brochures that were distributed by Dr Kemp this year to every school in this country—which claimed that direct funding for government schools between 1996-2000 has risen by 25 per cent or $382 million—were completely untrue.</para></talk.start><para>What we said was that, if you consider the effect of cost increases since 1996, cost increases have been in the order of 12 per cent, and enrolments in schools have increased. So if you consider the amount of money that is spent against the number of people it is spent on and the effect that that money actually has in the marketplace given the rising cost of schooling, you find that the increase in government expenditure is about 100th of what Dr Kemp was claiming in the letters he sent to parents in this country. I have indicated in my second reading contribution that I will expect an explanation from the government as to how much money was actually spent on those propaganda brochures.</para><para>Dr Kemp's claim, when examined closely, indicates that only $1.50 extra is being spent on students. But if you look at it in real terms—that is, what the money actually does—then the Commonwealth funding per government school student has declined. The calculations that I have presented to the Senate suggest to me that the funding has fallen from $606 per student in 1996 to less than $598 four years later. When you look at the government's figures and get away from the glossy propaganda efforts of this government, you see that the real situation is very different for ordinary Australians, for parents who are trying to meet the costs of educating their children at government schools. The government talks about the moneys it pays to the states, and when we look at the amount of money paid in general assistance grants, here too there are no real increases in funding. The 
 government's propaganda efforts should be exposed for the sham that they are.</para><para>Senator Allison's amendment, however, does not fix that problem. What Senator Allison's amendment relates to is a detail of a bill that is in fact not before the parliament. When we do see that bill, we will of course give a full- throated response. I see that Mr Evans is in the advisers' box today; I look forward to discussing these matters in detail with him at the estimates hearings.</para><para>In the meantime, we simply make the point that the government should be condemned for not providing an increase in government school funding which actually corresponds with the increases that they have made to the non-government sector. On the information that is in fact available to us, it probably will not be until April next year that we will see this bill that is implementing the government's major changes to school funding. So I think there is a need to examine the changes that are supposed to begin in 2001. I can guarantee the minister right now that, when he does introduce that bill, there will be a major Senate inquiry into such a fundamental change. I notice that the department officials are obviously looking forward to the prospect. I am sure that we will be able to provide them with plenty of opportunity to justify this government's decisions and to explain the gross inadequacies and inequities of this government's policies.</para><para>Schools will need time to adjust to the new arrangements. In that context, funding stability is important to them. The current funding quadrennium ends in December next year, so now that five months have passed since the budget announcement, the minister should seek to stop working on this ideological agenda in terms of higher education that has been handled so appallingly, and he should now start to focus on the more practical issues of getting the schools legislation into the parliament in time for this chamber to consider the government's proposals seriously and allow us to debate them fully.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10009</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this further amendment to the second reading motion.

That is some two years away. I am not saying that there should not be public debate about it. What I am saying is that this amendment is really focusing on the bill which we are dealing with today—the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999 —which has nothing to do with that proposed method of funding for non-government schools. Therefore, the amendment is really out of place. It is premature, it is irrelevant to this bill, and I will also say that the content of it is incorrect. There is no selective applying of funding with the result that the wealthiest private schools will be quarantined from any reduction as such. The method of funding is a much broader proposal than that. I think that for the Democrats to put it that way is really quite misleading. The government opposes this amendment for all those reasons—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—So you support mine?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>—I might add that we do not support Senator Carr's amendment. Having dealt with the amendment by the Democrats, I will now respond to speeches made during the second reading debate. I thank senators for their contributions and will perhaps refer to Senator Quirke's contribution first. Senator Quirke said that he came to this chamber with clean or dirty hands depending on which side you came from, indicating that he had taught in both the non-government and government sectors. The government does not accept that you would have dirty hands teaching in either of those sectors. The government would say that Senator Quirke, having been a teacher in either of those sectors, comes to the Senate with clean hands.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have met many teachers in both the government and non-government sectors who are very good teachers. Those two sectors the government supports. The government wants a strong government sector and a strong non-government sector. We do not look upon it as being one versus the other, although there are some in the opposition who no doubt do. Senator Carr might advance that argument in the committee stage. The government certainly does not look upon those two sectors as being adverse to each other or in competition with each other or that one is right and one is wrong. Both are essential to the furtherance of good education in this country and the government supports both of those sectors strongly.</para><para>In relation to Senator Quirke's concerns about how Australian students achieve satisfactory outcomes, the Commonwealth government, with state governments, has agreed to participate in the OECD program of international student assessment, where there will be international comparisons in relation to the outcome of students in such things as literacy and numeracy. That is a very important step. For those senators who criticise the government's proposals and reforms in relation to literacy can I say this: never before in the history of this country has there been such an advance in the areas of literacy and numeracy as there has been in the last three years. We have seen for the first time ever in the history of Australia the implementation of national benchmarks in years 3 and 5 for literacy. We are looking at a completely cooperative approach from state, territory and federal governments to the question of literacy.</para><para>A survey was conducted which revealed that there was an unacceptably high level of Australian students who did not have appropriate skills in literacy and numeracy. When travelling around Australia visiting schools when I was the minister responsible for schools, the government's efforts in relation to literacy were endorsed overwhelmingly wherever I went. You need go no further than Australian parents to realise how high a value they place on Australian students having high levels of literacy. I say that to those senators 
 who criticise the government's approach to the question of literacy.</para><para>Senator Allison mentioned that we needed to equip teachers with the skills to carry out the government's programs and that the government had in some way neglected teachers. The government in its quality teacher program has committed to $77.7 million over four years for professional development. The appropriation of that is being dealt with in the same way as the previous Labor government, that is, by virtue of an appropriation bill which, as I understand it, has some $15 million set aside. But that does not mean that we are stepping back from the promise that we made to the people of Australia when we went to the federal election last year. What we are appropriating is entirely in accordance with our program of over $77 million over four years for the professional development of teachers.</para><para>This is a very important point. Whilst we as a government have introduced these reforms, at the same time we have to equip Australian teachers with the ability, with the professional development, to deliver on those reforms and to assist them in how they go about their professional duties. I reject emphatically that in any way we have stepped back from that undertaking, that commitment. This $15 million is just a step forward in the overall funding of over $77 million in that regard.</para><para>Senator Carr criticised the government's method of funding. I reiterate that the way we are doing this is no different to how the Labor government appropriated moneys in relation to a similar program. There has been criticism of the amounts of funding in these bills. I think it was Senator Allison who said that the amounts referred to were less than in the budget. What we have here is $38.3 million for the year 2000 to increase funding under the literacy and numeracy programs. We will introduce supplementation subsequent to these bills which will take that to the figures mentioned in the budget. Similarly, we have $27.9 million for NALSAS, National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools, and again there will be supplementation in relation to that.</para><para>What the government is saying is that there is no diminution of funding here. We have simply got these amounts that we have mentioned in these bills and then supplementation will be forthcoming which will take those amounts to the levels that were mentioned in the budget. There is really nothing untoward in that. There is a process which has been used by this and other governments and it is entirely in accordance with standing practice. I just want to make that very clear for the record.</para><para>Senator Crossin mentioned the proposed funding model for non-government schools. Again I would say to the Senate that Senator Crossin is talking about a program which, as I mentioned earlier in relation to Senator Allison's amendment, is going to come into play in the year 2001. The government is yet to introduce legislation in relation to that. There has been widespread public debate and consultation on that funding proposal and no doubt there will be further public debate, especially when the government's legislation comes forward, but this is not the bill which is relevant to that. This bill does not deal with that SES funding model. Senator Crossin's comments are in the same category as the amendment pressed for by Senator Allison—that is, irrelevant to this bill and somewhat premature.</para><para>The question of funding has been raised by senators in the chamber. The government stands by its statement that between the years 1996 and 2000 there has been a 25 per cent increase in direct funding to government schools. This equates to some $382 million. Senator Carr continues to disregard the additional moneys provided through enrolment growth and the payment of supplementation on grants and which represents significant extra funding for government schools each year. In 1999, Commonwealth recurrent supplementation to government schools will increase by 5.5 per cent. This is a very important figure to remember. This supplementation in 1999 will increase by 5.5 per cent. This is well ahead of the CPI which, in 1998-99, was only 1.2 per cent. That reveals an excess in supplementation of 4.3 per cent, which Senator Carr fails to recognise.</para><para>It is also important for the record that we clarify the real situation in relation to our financial assistance grants. Senator Carr disputes a reference in the government schools flyers, which he mentioned earlier, to a three per cent real increase in these grants to state schools and the capacity they have to apply some of this increase to government schools. In 1996, state and territory governments agreed to enter into state fiscal contribution agreements with the Commonwealth for a period of three years. Some states contributed from their financial assistance grants payments while other states contributed through a reduction in a variety of non-educational programs or through their own revenue raising. There is no evidence to suggest that any state reduced funding to education and training as a result of these agreements.</para><para>In 1998-99, we saw the final year that the states were required to repay the state fiscal contribution. When this is taken into account, there is a three per cent real increase in financial assistance grants between the years 1998 and 2000. That might seem somewhat complex but it has an important effect, and the important effect is a three per cent increase in those financial assistance grants which are so important to the various state governments. That entirely negates the point that Senator Carr tries to make in relation to any reduction in funding by this government. This government has an excellent record on education funding. As I mentioned earlier, this government has seen reforms in education—literacy and numeracy being two of a few.</para><para>In this bill we see further funding for National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools—something which I found to be very popular in all the schools that I visited. As we know, Australia is situated in South-East Asia. This is a very important program for the future of the up-and-coming generation of Australians and also for Australia. Asian languages and studies not only promote harmony within Australia in terms of our diverse cultural background but also, importantly, give Australian students, Australian leaders of the future, an ability to communicate with our Asian neighbours in their 
 own language and to develop an understanding of their customs and cultures.</para><para>Turning to literacy: as I mentioned earlier, we have seen unprecedented cooperation between the various governments of the states and territories and the Commonwealth. This has led to a situation where, at long last, we have a standard gauge across Australia on literacy. It is now the foundation for this country to go forward in building a program for the future for the development of literacy across the nation. We are also doing the same with numeracy. The opposition and other senators might want to pick up on what various state ministers have said about the Commonwealth's reforms, but I would ask the Senate and the community at large: if these governments are so critical of us, why did they adopt our proposals? Why did they join with the Commonwealth government in advancing literacy and numeracy in Australian schools? They did that because they could see there was a need for it and the community wanted it done. That is what we have seen happen.</para><para>The second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr is one which completely misunderstands the Commonwealth's reforms in relation to literacy. It attempts to make a political point where none is really worth while. It cheapens, or attempts to cheapen, something that is a thoroughly worthwhile program for Australian students. To suggest that this government has pursued literacy in a cynical fashion is to cheapen the reform which has been adopted across Australia by parents, teachers, government and non-government sectors and also state and territory governments.</para><para>The second part of the motion talks about failing to provide government schools with additional resources. I stand by my previous comments in relation to the increase in funding by this government. This government stands on its record of having increased opportunities and funding for government schools. That is on the record, and Senator Carr cannot run away from it. All the amendments he might want to move in this chamber will not change the good work the government has done in relation to education.</para><para>Amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison's</inline>) not agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name></talker><para>—The question is now that the amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

Given that the annual report has been released to us only today, I have not had an opportunity to peruse it in detail, but I am concerned about the question of student retention rates. I notice that in estimates answer No. E8 you said the report will be available in October, and I presume this is the same report that was referred to in that answer. On page 43 of the annual report we have revealed to us today for the first time, as I understand it, that student retention rates in the last three years have in fact dropped. What is the government's explanation for that decline?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>10014</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Temporary Chairman, I do not have that answer at hand for Senator Carr and, whilst not conceding in any way that there has necessarily been a decline, I will take that question on notice.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>10014</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given that there has been a decline in funding in real terms for government schools, would there not be a correlation between the decline in public support by this government and the decline in retention rates of students? I notice that there has been, as I say, a significant decline, given the number of students leaving school early. That has come from a high of a 77 per cent retention rate in 1991 down to—and these figures are slightly different from the ones that DETYA has produced—71.8 per 
 cent in 1997. I understand the figure has been given by DETYA as 72 per cent in 1998, but my understanding is that the later figures demonstrate a continuing decline in the numbers of students completing school.</para></talk.start><para>I understand the retention rates are well below the national average in a number of states; that just 66 per cent of male students are completing school at year 12, which compares with 78 per cent for females; and that the retention rate is down to 66 per cent in the government school sector compared with 84 per cent in the non-government school sector. Is it the case, Minister, that the figures that I have indicated to you can be confirmed? Would you also be able to advise me whether or not these are well below the international education benchmarks and whether Australia lags behind many other OECD countries in terms of the overall level of educational attainment, not just for persons under the age of 21 but for the adult population at large?</para><para>Given that is the case, what is the impact that the declining level of public support, as a result of cuts to government expenditure in real terms to public schools, has had on those figures? Would the minister agree that there are substantial costs to this country as a result of early school leaving? Would he concur that early school leavers do not enjoy a number of the benefits that those who complete their schooling do? Would he concur that there is a massive cost to individuals in terms of decreased opportunities for job mobility and training, lower levels of personal health, decreased financial security and of course lower levels of non-wage benefits?</para><para>Would he concur that for the country this has very serious impacts in terms of decreased social cohesion, higher costs associated with health care, higher costs associated with crime prevention and higher costs associated with various social security measures? So I would ask: Minister, would you further agree that, because of our low levels of secondary school completion, Australia has been placed at a severe disadvantage when compared with our international competitors and that the decline of one year's early school leaving, as the Dusseldorp Skills Forum has recently re 
 vealed, has an overall cost to this country of some $2.6 billion?</para><para>I understand that these may not be questions that the minister has responses to immediately, but I do seek from the government a response to these propositions. I would also ask: is it reasonable to conclude that costs of that magnitude are involved in the decline in retention rates? Further, is this not a direct consequence of the failure of government to meet its responsibilities to ensure that there are growing levels of support for schooling in this country? Minister, I ask you about those points at this stage and I will move on to another issue in a moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>10015</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We will take those questions on notice as there are a number of them dealing broadly with the complex question of reduced retention rates in schools. But can I just say to the chamber and to those listening that the question of how retention rates in school relate to the economy of the times is a complex one, because you might have a reduction in retention rates from students leaving school to enter the work force or, more importantly, to take up training.</para></talk.start><para>We have a record number of people in training in Australia at the moment. The figure, as I recall, is about 230,000, which is a record for this country. That would indicate that people are going into training, especially young people, and it could well be the case that some people are leaving school earlier to take up apprenticeships. That is a good outcome because that particular student has made a decision and said, `I think I have done enough schooling. I can now go into a worthwhile apprenticeship and forge a career somewhere in the trades or elsewhere.'</para><para>It is trite and also misleading to say that it is simply a question of resources that leads to a reduction in the retention rates. A booming economy could result in students leaving school earlier to take up training or work. It does not indicate per se that there is an insufficient amount of funding from government. But there are a number of questions that Senator Carr has indicated there, and we will take those on notice.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10015</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, you would be well aware that there is a growing body of evidence that, for persons aged between 15 and 20, access to a formal structure of training opportunities is actually declining. You would be well aware that the number of students involved in TAFE colleges in that age group is declining. Actual enrolments are declining, as I understand it. You would also be aware that it has been revealed in this Dusseldorp study that 35,000 students will not complete their secondary schooling and will—and I emphasise this—subsequently obtain no further formal education or training qualifications. The response that these students are being transferred to new apprenticeships is quite clearly not the case. The empirical evidence shows this is not the case.</para></talk.start><para>Furthermore, I take the opportunity to draw to the minister's attention—since he has already indicated to me that this a schools bill and not a VET bill—that the number of non-completions, or the failure rate for new apprenticeships, is actually increasing quite dramatically. In some of the estimates I have seen there is as much as a 40 per cent increase in the failure rate. So there are a number of problems for young people in terms of the services being made available by government. The real opportunities, the evidence would suggest to me, are declining.</para><para>I come back to this proposition, Minister: what responsibilities do governments have for this? What responsibility does this federal government have? I note, in an answer to a question during estimates which was drawn to my attention, that the forward estimates for the year 2003 involve a reduction of 5.4 per cent in the government school share of total recurrent funding. It stands now at 31.6 per cent of overall recurrent expenditure. Government schools stand to receive just 29.9 per cent of recurrent funding in 2003 as opposed to 31.6 per cent in 1999. Can you confirm those figures, Minister?</para><para>Can you also confirm that non-government schools share the growth as estimated at 58.4 per cent to 62 per cent? Is it not the case that those figures are accurate? Is it not the case that your answer No. E3 on a chart that was 
 attached to that on page 7 demonstrates that the level of Commonwealth support to government schools is actually declining and the level of support to non-government schools is growing and that, as a consequence, the level of opportunities for young people is falling in this country as a direct result of this government's negligence?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>10016</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What Senator Carr is failing to remember here is that you have a very important player in this—the state governments. They are primarily responsible for the non-government sector. I would cite the `Federal assistance for government schools' pamphlet, which was sent to assist parents in understanding the arguments. There was a question entitled, `Aren't government schools being underfunded compared to private schools?' There it was stated:</para></talk.start><para>The two million government school students in this country are supported by an annual budget from Commonwealth and state governments of $13 billion. One million non-government school students are supported by public funding of about $3 billion. Public spending per student is, on average, $5,600 for a government school student. The same figure, on average, for a non-government student is $3,750. For students at wealthier schools, this figure can be as low as $1,500 per student.</para><para>So it is $1,500 compared to $5,600. It is a fractional amount of what is being provided to government school students, if I can put it in that context. What Senator Carr is failing to realise is that it is the state governments that receive these financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth. The application of those funds is the responsibility of the state governments for the government school sector. As to the specific figures Senator Carr mentions, I will take them on notice and we will see if they are correct.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10016</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I think you have already demonstrated in the answers that you have given today that the level of support for the FAGs program by this government is not going to increase.

 would suggest that, despite the claims being made about the impact of the GST on the actual cost of schooling, costs to parents will increase quite substantially but there will be no real increases through the state governments or by the Commonwealth.</para></talk.start><para>Minister, if you say resources are not the issue, particularly when we talk specifically on the question of retention rates, is the government not concerned with the impending end of the Jobs Pathway program and the end of $20 million a year that ANTA has allocated for VET in schools?

Aren't you concerned that the end of these programs will impact on VET in schools and particularly on the access and equity components of such programs?

The level of retention of students at school is not purely a question of resources; you have to look at the economy, employment and how many students are entering training. Senator Carr needs to be careful. I mentioned that qualification of resources only in relation to retention levels. It was not stated as some across-the-board proposal that resources would not matter in the education sector. Far from it. I reiterated that we have increased funding for government schools between 1996 and the year 2000 by 25 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Carr mentioned the Jobs Pathway program. This is a worthwhile program and will be reviewed when the time comes for it to be assessed by the government. It is a program which is more in the VET sector, but I appreciate that Senator Carr refers to this during the schools debate because it is a program which builds a bridge from schools to work and assists those students in need. That program will be assessed on its merits when the time comes for review.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>10016</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, on the question of resources and the figures that you have already provided to me, I want to confirm that I have understood the 
 import of what I have been told. In the period from 1999 to 2003, the average per capita funding will drop for government schools from 38.3 per cent to 35.3 per cent. At the same time, the average per capita funding for non-government schools will increase from 61.7 per cent to 64.7 per cent in the year 2003. Minister, if those figures are accurate, based on the answers you have given me in previous estimates, how can you maintain that the government's policies are fair? How can you maintain that there is equality of opportunities for students across both sectors? Is it not the case that the government's policies are deliberately designed to reduce opportunities for government schooling and to channel enrolments into the private sector? What does the government believe this involves or implies for Australian families who want to see their children educated in government schools?</para></talk.start><para>I have talked about the general, and now I will deal with the specifics of targeted assistance programs. Is it not the case that there will be a projected drop in the period 1999-2003 from 6.7 per cent of total recurrent expenditure to just 5.4 per cent? Will there also be a drop in the non-government area from 3.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent? Given the nature of the debate about the impact of the GST and the capacity of the states to meet their obligations, and given the context in which the minister answered the previous question, how can he possibly say that there will be an increase in real terms—real dollars—to Australian families so as to allow them to get a better quality of education for their children under this government's policies? What is the government's intention with regard to targeted assistance? Is it the government's intention to genuinely improve the opportunities for Australians to enjoy the benefits of a quality education in the public sector?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>10017</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Through the national goals process, we are working towards greater outcomes for Australian students. In relation to those targeted programs that Senator Carr has mentioned, we have not determined the level of funding for 
 those out years because—as Senator Carr knows, this is how it has been done in the past—targeted programs have specific funding for the initial year, and the out years are determined when they arise. That is an absolutely appropriate way to do things, because you look at the need at the time. To say what a targeted program will need specifically in the future can sometimes be fraught with difficulty.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Carr mentioned as an example a targeted program like NALSAS. I will not go over what I have said previously about Asian languages and studies. Suffice it to say, the government have supported that program with further funding and did so when Senator Carr and others were raising a scare campaign that we would not. We stand on our record in relation to these various programs. In relation to the funding per capita for government and non-government students, Senator Carr has failed to tell the people of Australia that there will be a shift in enrolment. To date we have seen a shift in enrolment patterns. There tends to be a greater growth in the non-government sector, so when he cites projection of funding figures for funding per student, he is not taking into account any possible shift in enrolments. As Senator Carr knows, this is a complex area. To use a second-rate crystal ball to see how the funding will go in the future will only mislead people. Senator Carr should be very careful when he makes the sorts of statements that funding per student will necessarily fall or grow in relation to either the government or non-government sector.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>10017</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister suggests that I am using a second-rate crystal ball—the sort of description I could have enjoyed using myself, I think; I give him credit for that. Minister, there are many points of argument now developing and an overwhelming body of evidence that suggests that the opportunities for young people—and I think this is a critical issue in a schools-education debate—are in fact declining under this government, that the real options available are actually not meeting the needs of many hundreds of thousands of Australians, that there is an 
 increasing level of numbers of students who are dropping out of school and that the retention rates are falling—which is the clearest evidence of that—and that the opportunities in other sectors are not being made available for those students. As a consequence, there is a growing crisis for young adults.</para></talk.start><para>I would suggest, though, that there are many others in the community who share this view and that they might not have a description such as a `second-rate crystal ball' applied to them.

They say in the report that I have before me, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia's young adults: the deepening divide</inline>, published in April of this year, that there are in fact growing problems that the government's policies are not addressing. I ask you quite specifically, Minister: is it the case that, despite a number of programs aimed at young adults, there is no overall policy statement by the Commonwealth government about youth? Is it the case that there is no overall set of performance outcomes identified for existing programs? Is it the case that this lack of strategic focus has been a stimulus for the reality and risk and deepening divide that the collaborations in the Dusseldorp report of the date that I have referred to outlined?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>10018</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Carr knows that in December there is to be the Senate estimates process, when the education portfolio is subject to a great deal of scrutiny not only by Senator Carr but also by others and that the various performance measures we have in relation to the various

In that, I refer to such things as training, education and other areas.</para></talk.start><para>The government have increased opportunities for young people since we came to power. I point out that it is all very well for the opposition to ask, `Where are your nice warm statements? Where are your nice glowing references? You must have them.' What we are about is outcomes.

What we are about is reducing youth unemployment, increasing the numbers of young people in training and increasing levels of literacy and numeracy for young Australian students. They are real outcomes. They are not just warm and fuzzy statements. They are runs on the board and they are what we are achieving.</para><para>Recently, we had a further meeting of the Youth Roundtable, which Dr Kemp set up. The Youth Roundtable, I believe, is a great success. I have been a participant in a number of its functions. Talking to these young people, who represent all walks of life of young people across Australia, I get the feedback that it is a great step forward and that it is a forum where young people can express views for government to take on board. Some of those views are not always in accordance with policy or what the government are doing, but that is why we have the forum: so that they can say these things to us. So we not only have the outcomes; we also have a means by which young people can be heard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10018</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Finally, I would like to repeat that this is not a question about `second-rate crystal balls'.

That is fact, Minister. I ask you: if that is not the case, why is it not? Is it the case that the estimated lifetime cost, discounted to 1999 in real terms, to students in the country is in fact around $74,000 per student? Is it also the case that half this cost is a direct monetary cost borne partly by the individual and partly by government, that the remaining half is the social cost which falls across the individual, the government and the whole community, that the overall cost to Australia of one year's early school leavers is estimated to be $2.6 billion, and that reducing the number of early school leavers would be a very sound basis for investment for the individuals concerned, for the government and for this community as a whole? I ask, Minister, whether, just on that monetary basis, it would yield an estimate of something like a 12.5 per cent rate of return?</para><para>These are the sorts of facts that this particular government understands—these sorts of equations based on rates of return.

In fact, only 30 per cent of all students go on to tertiary education. This government has been mindful of the 70 per cent of students who do not see themselves going on to tertiary education. Of course, of the 70 per cent there are a number who will not see their way through secondary schooling because they will leave to go into training, or they might take up work. Senator 
 Carr fails to realise that unemployment under this government has fallen greatly. We are now looking at unemployment of just over seven per cent compared with just over 11 per cent under the previous government. Where you have got higher employment obviously there is going to be an attraction for some students to enter the work force.

These are initiatives which were announced in the budget.</para><para>The debate on this bill could not have been more timely. I have no doubt that the minister welcomes the opportunity to canvass these issues this particular week. Last week, Dr Kemp's true agenda was made public. Stripped of its rhetoric, doubletalk and all the spin doctoring that one has come to expect from Dr Kemp, a pattern of deceit has emerged from the propaganda machine that he has developed. Dr Kemp's submission was revealed last week, bare for all to see, and what an ugly sight it was.</para><para>Having starved universities of funds since the savage $840 million cuts in 1996—and of course all the additional cuts, which I will deal with later on—Dr Kemp's ideological plan is to deregulate the system and to turn higher education in this country into a commercially-driven market free-for-all. Dr Kemp has been obliged to admit in that submission that he and his policies have led to a crisis in higher education—a crisis very much of his own creation. What he has been obliged to admit, but what he will not say publicly, is that `demand for higher education in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria is unlikely to be met'. That is a direct quote from the submission. The submission also states that there is `no capacity to reduce huge regional disparities in . . . participation', and that people from `affluent capital city suburbs are five times more likely 
 to go to university' than people from the least affluent areas. It states that `universities are currently in a difficult financial position.'</para><para>His own cabinet submission admits that `already, eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk'. He indicates that there are `higher student-staff ratios and less frequent lecture and tutorial contact'. He says that universities have outdated technology and, as a result, universities are `progressively less capable of delivering what government wants, industry needs and the community expects'. As a result of this, Dr Kemp, in his own words, tells us that `there is a perception of declining quality'.</para><para>I expect, when the government have read this submission again and refreshed their memories of what their minister was saying, that they will be only too happy to vote for our second reading amendment. I expect every member of the government to rush over here and support that amendment because they know the truth of it. The truth of it is demonstrated by the fact that the government minister, Dr Kemp, has revealed the truth in his own cabinet submission.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—We'll join you over there.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—I see Senator Abetz is here yet again. I would have thought that Senator Abetz would have learned something from his recent performances in this chamber and have been obliged to keep himself a little under control. I expect Senator Abetz to join with the opposition and support us in our second reading amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we see is a dismal list of woes. We note from Dr Kemp's own documents that there is a perception of declining quality. There is no clearer indication of the truth of this than that he presents this information to his colleagues, presumably in secret—he had no expectation that such opinions would be revealed. What he seeks to do after creating a crisis is to exploit that crisis, and he then suggests that the solution is deregulation of fees. He seeks to propose a university tuition subsidy which follows the student—by any other name, a voucher. He seeks that there be no guaranteed minimum amount of funding for institutions. He also seeks to have another 
 bash at universities, which are struggling thanks to his own starvation policies, and he seeks to propose a student loan scheme with a real rate of interest.</para><para>Of course, the government claims that all that is off the agenda: `No, sorry. Sorry, we didn't mean any of that. Having been caught red-handed, we don't really mean it any more.' This is despite the fact that this is the second time that such propositions have been before the cabinet this year. So how could anyone possibly believe the denials that this government issues on a regular basis? From what we have before us, it is clear that this government's interest in education—particularly the sorts of policies that Dr Kemp has been pursuing—is predicated on assumptions which will see a return to policies of the 1950s. He sees this as a modernising process: his idea of modernisation is to return to the fifties. We will see a situation where fewer and fewer people of modest backgrounds will be able to attend university, and universities will be places for the wealthy and the privileged. He seeks to establish a new set of arrangements which return to a system of administration in universities for the privileged few. The big eight universities will do very well; the rest of the universities will be reduced in status and some may not be able to continue at all.</para><para>We see that those who thought that John Howard's code of ministerial conduct was meant to mean something can now see for themselves that it means very little indeed. We were told that governments were supposed to be frank and honest. But we have noticed that there can be no frankness and no honesty from this government when we see the propositions revealed in that cabinet submission, which demonstrate that what they are saying in private and what they are saying in public are two different things altogether. So when Dr Kemp says that there will be no vouchers—yet he uses the terms that are used in that cabinet submission—you can clearly see that this is a situation in which, to quote the Bard, `a rose by any other name would smell as sweet'. I would say that a `universal subsidy which follows the student' smells just as bad as a voucher.</para><para>That is the government's policy, despite the claims that are made when they are caught. That has been the government's secret policy since their election. I have absolutely no doubt that they will pursue that policy because it is predicated on an ideological obsession—an ideological obsession that Dr Kemp and the Prime Minister happen to have. They happen to believe that, if you have a position of privilege and power, you should be able to exploit the resources available in this country to entrench that privilege and power. We see that Dr Kemp and the Prime Minister are chained together by what I regard as a bond of mutual deceit and dishonesty. The true intent of the government has been revealed to the public. Of course, the government has sought to rule out these various scams once they are revealed, but the truth remains that this government developed a cabinet submission on the direction of cabinet itself. As it was with the GST and as we have seen with Senator Newman and her changes to the social security system, when governments claim they are not doing things, you cannot for a moment believe them under this regime.</para><para>What we see before us is that the government have presented a whole series of problems but would appear to have no solutions for them. That is what we are expected to take on face value—that the government acknowledge that there is a crisis but they do not have any solution to that crisis. We see, however, one final thing remaining of that original package, one final thing remaining in terms of their public admissions: that is, they plan to introduce sweeping industrial relations reforms to the higher education sector to do over the workers in universities in order to balance the books. So what we have noticed is a re-run; the proposal is a re-run of the waterfront dispute, but this time with the universities instead of the docks. This is a plan to make workers in universities pay and pay and then pay some more for the government's policy disaster. They seek to predicate this on the fundamental premise of coercion—which, of course, we were told was illegal under their Workplace Relations Act. They are seeking legal advice to get around their own act—and that is revealed in clause 
 32 of the cabinet submission. We are looking forward to seeing that legal advice, because I am sure it will be contested in the courts as the government seeks to pursue this policy, this ideological obsession.</para><para>In the past the government have said that their concerns are demonstrated by their merit based equity scholarship scheme—which the government are now seeking to remove. After cutting six per cent from the universities' operating grants, increasing HECS charges by up to 125 per cent, lowering the repayments threshold to around $21,000, abolishing the Commonwealth-industry places scheme and slashing half a billion dollars from student assistance, any reasonable person would say that the Commonwealth education ministers might not be able to sustain a case that they are interested in equity. Any reasonable person would suggest that enough damage has already been inflicted in this portfolio. Any reasonable person would also suggest that it is time for Dr Kemp to go. They would suggest that his slashing of a further $39 million by the abolition of the merit based equity scholarship scheme is totally unjustified.</para><para>I would suggest that this government is predicating its education policies on a premise that it can in fact proceed to produce fewer opportunities for young Australians. The opportunities that remain will of course go to those with the greatest capacity to pay. That is what they mean by user pays: if you have got enough money, you take advantage of opportunities that are presented.</para><para>The merit based scholarship scheme was only a tiny token offered by the government in its 1996 cuts to the higher education budgets. This minor concession to the needs of students who were locked out of the university as a result of its changes to HECS is now being withdrawn as well. This government constantly talks about increased moneys available for higher education. Yet again we have the pea and thimble trick being presented by this minister. We have seen student income support cut by $500 million. We have seen HECS payments charges increased by $313 million. We have seen the lowering of the repayment threshold to many thousands of 
 dollars below average weekly earnings, taking a further $817 million from students and graduates. When Senator Vanstone announced the merit based equity scholarship scheme, she told us:</para><para>The facts are that if you come from a socio-economically disadvantaged background or a rural or geographically remote area, your chances of going to university are less than if you come from a high status background and live in an urban area . . . </para><para>These measures are aimed at bringing higher education within the reach of ordinary Australians. They are a practical demonstration of the Government's real commitment to fairness and equity in higher education.</para><para>What a joke. What a complete joke. One thousand scholarships were offered in 1997, building to a pool of 4,000 in 1999. The scheme has scarcely begun and we now see it being axed. This followed the so-called sounding out of the effectiveness of the scheme which was carried out by DETYA in what can only be described as another bodgie survey. They involved university equity officers being asked via email for their views on the scheme, in such a way that it could be easily assumed that the government was seeking to improve and enhance the scheme rather than axe it.</para><para>This is the whole problem when you are dealing with this government. You have to be very careful in appreciating what the intention of the government really is, because it is usually not the intention that they say. There were 19 equity officers who responded to the suggestion that by providing a grant at the time of the study rather than a HECS exemption the scheme could be improved and financially disadvantaged students could be retained in the universities. Instead of using this amount of money in the ways suggested by the survey, the government has used the findings to abolish the scheme. This is a further demonstration of the government's lack of any real commitment to equity. Opportunity and access are the casualties along the Howard government's road to user pays in education.</para><para>Let me turn to Australian Education International. I am sure that this will be a matter that I will have to pursue in the committee stage of the bill. It is a matter of great con 
 cern to me. This bill provides funding to the end of 2001 for Australian Education International, whose job is to promote Australian education world wide. It was originally set up in 1994 under the name of the Australian International Education Foundation. The AEI is fully funded by government and it represents all sections of the industry—schools, ELICOS, TAFE, and private training providers in the higher education institutions. The government's management—and I say there is very strong evidence of mismanagement—of our education export industry has been the focus of a good deal of attention in recent times and I can assure this government it will be the focus of a great deal more attention in the times ahead.</para><para>We have seen this government being obliged to move back onto the back foot because it is quite clearly unable to react effectively to the developments that are occurring within this industry. It should be anticipating them. It should not be forced to respond to the opposition in the way it is. It should be ahead of the game. Given the resources that are available to government, one could expect it to at least have some knowledge of the developments in this industry and be able to move ahead to anticipate actions rather than being forced by the opposition to take up various inquiries. Take the Greenwich University, for instance. The government has apparently had ample warning of the plans to establish this institution of very doubtful provenance. What it was obliged to do was to establish an inquiry into the bona fides of the institution, its management and its courses. It was not until these issues were pursued by the opposition that such action was taken.</para><para>The AEI, which has been spending a great deal of time promoting Australian education, has not taken sufficient care to protect our reputation in that promotion effort. It has not been paying sufficient attention to protecting our reputation for quality and integrity, which are the fundamental ingredients in the success of this industry. It is appropriate that we ask the government to give some thought to the way in which it is sorting out the issues that have been presented, particularly in view of the impact of the advances in the technologi 
 cal delivery of education. We have seen what has happened with Greenwich. At the end of the review process we will see new criteria established. I trust that these will be rigorous criteria; that they will be criteria from which we can genuinely measure the quality of educational institutions such as Greenwich.</para><para>I would ask the government: what avenues are open to the government to fix up the problems—problems of its own creation, brought about as a result of the incompetence of the minister for territories in not being able to respond to the blindly obvious problems that presented themselves and in signing off on a proposition to grant the authority to establish a university effectively under Australian law through the territory of Norfolk Island in such away as to allow that institution to exploit the reputation of this country?</para><para>I might take the opportunity in the committee stage to discuss the review of the ESOS Act, particularly the question of the massive abuses that are appearing with regard to international students by a number of bogus colleges and shysters that are currently operating in this country. This review, which the government has again sought as a means of silencing the opposition, does not address the fact that this government has enormous powers available to clean up the industry but has not used those powers. This is a bill which the opposition is, of course, obliged to support. We ask, however, that it be amended in the terms of the amendment that I have circulated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>10023</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats are in a similar position in that we have to support the funding bill before us, and indeed we will.

The Democrats will be moving a further amendment to that second reading amendment, which I believe will be circulated shortly.</para></talk.start><para>The  Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  sets out funding for the higher education sector in 2001 and varies the 
 amounts for 1999 and 2000 already provided for in the Higher Education Funding Act 1998. It also sets out a number of funding priorities announced in the 1999-2000 federal budget. Some of these are to be welcomed, such as the money—$14.7 million—that has been put aside for science lectureships. I think we have all been alarmed at the declining enrolments in science courses around the country, and we would be the first to suggest that more needs to be done to encourage participation in those particular fields.</para><para>I might add that this is a very similar debate to that that we were having back in 1996 with the then science minister, Minister Peter McGauran, who acknowledged that there was some concern—indeed, his higher education minister at the time, Senator Amanda Vanstone, acknowledged that there was some concern—about a lack of participation in science and science based courses around the country. The answer from this government of course was to put up the rate that students pay in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme for science and some science based courses, so much so that students who commenced their studies after 1 January 1997 would be paying $4,855 per annum for HECS. If you round that out, in three or four years you are looking at a debt of at least $20,000. I hardly think that is a financial incentive to enrol in a science course. Nonetheless, the science lectureships is a program we support. We also welcome the so-called commitment to regional education through the funding of 60 additional places in the medical faculty of James Cook University—although I would also add that recent events have led all in the sector and many outside it too, I suppose, to question the government's real commitment to regional and rural campuses.</para><para>However, this bill also contains a number of regressive proposals. Foremost among them is, of course, the defunding of the Higher Education Equity Merits Scholarships Scheme, which Senator Carr referred to in the debate. This was a scheme introduced, I guess, as a buffer to the quite deleterious funding cuts and deleterious changes that were introduced under the former minister for 
 higher education, Senator Amanda Vanstone, back in 1996. Clearly, the justification or the rationale behind the introduction of the scholarships was to address the significant equity and access concerns in the higher education sector—that is, the idea was to grant HECS exemptions to students facing barriers to accessing higher education. Figures regarding access to education by specific equity groups show that, while women and students from non-English speaking backgrounds have greatly increased their participation in higher education, much needs to be done to achieve similar results within the indigenous population and for potential students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.</para><para>When these exemption scholarships were introduced, the Democrats raised a number of concerns about their inadequacy in actually addressing some of the real barriers that exist to entering higher education, especially for disadvantaged groups. We highlighted not only the current disincentives, fees and charges, et cetera that are barriers to access but also the measly amount put aside. Four thousand scholarships over four years was never going to address the significant barriers that so many students face. We found it difficult to believe at the time that this scheme was ever going to overcome many of the disincentives imposed by this and previous governments in the years since the introduction of the scheme.</para><para>You have to remember that these barriers in many ways have been compounded by not only university funding cuts but also HECS hikes, changes to student financial assistance with the introduction of the common youth allowance with the higher age of independence, the changes to the differential levels of HECS, the percentile increase on the repayment of HECS as well as the reduction of the threshold to unrealistic levels—the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their debts—and the up-front undergraduate fees in some cases. So we were always concerned that these scholarships were not going to address the significant access and equity concerns that existed. Nonetheless, though they were measly, they were some buffer 
 against some of the radical and regressive changes that were introduced by the government in 1996.</para><para>I note that Senator Carr referred to Senator Vanstone's comments and rationale at the time. I notice that even Dr David Kemp in a speech two years ago to the lower house actually said:</para><para>As higher education numbers expand we must make sure that opportunities to participate are widespread.</para><para>Indeed, Dr Kemp. He went on:</para><para>People with disabilities, people from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, women in non-traditional areas of study, people from rural and isolated areas, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginal and Torres Strait</para><para>Islanders are all beneficiaries of the merit scholarships introduced in 1997.</para><para>He went on:</para><para>These scholarships provide exemption from the HECS charge to an additional</para><para>1,000 effective full-time student units each year. By the year 2000 the scholarships will provide exemptions of 4,000 equivalent full-time student units, which means that well over 4,000 students will benefit each year.</para><para>I ask the minister now: does he see no reason for these scholarships to continue? Does he genuinely believe that as a consequence of the government's changes to higher education students from those very disadvantaged backgrounds whom he describes no longer need some form of assistance? I guess at least the pretence is gone. There is no suggestion now by this government that it is even going to pretend in some token way to assist those students who are disadvantaged in the sector.</para><para>Indeed, Senator Vanstone in this chamber, in this very place, back in August 1996 in response to a dorothy dixer from Senator O'Chee—no doubt exercising some seriously needed damage control on the issue of the 1996 budget changes and so-called reforms to higher education—boasted proudly:</para><para>We are introducing 4,000 equity and merit based scholarships. If, by returning to universities the HECS contributions for students, they over-enrol we are, in fact, encouraging universities to provide more places.</para><para>She went on to talk about the impact of free education and how she believed access was 
 greater for wealthier students at that time. She justified the merit equity scholarships, suggesting that this would overcome some of the disadvantages and the barriers that some students face. Obviously, those words do not mean anything more to this government, certainly not to the current minister David Kemp. He sees no need to provide such opportunities about which he boasted quite strongly in 1997, and no doubt even more recently.</para><para>Generally it must seem for many in the sector that every time we debate a higher education funding amendment bill in this place it is a bit like Ground Hog Day. There always seems to be some upheaval, some turbulence in the sector, usually created by the government of the day. In 1996 we saw a raft of broken promises, not the least of which was the government backing down on its so-called election manifesto promise that it would not cut operating grants. Since then we have seen increases to fees and charges, deregulation of some undergraduate places and cuts to student financial assistance. The list goes on.</para><para>Only this week, as Senator Carr has said, we have seen the expose, if you like, of the government's true agenda, or more specifically Dr David Kemp's agenda, for higher education in this country. I note that in his speech to the House of Representatives on the very bill before us, Minister Kemp makes no secret of his agenda—the fact that `universities must take principal responsibility for increasing their income'. He acknowledges that they have made substantial efforts in that direction, not because they necessarily want to be more `entrepreneurial', to use the minister's word, but they have had no choice. How ironic it is that this government could suggest that the higher education sector as a whole is greatly in need of assistance and then fail to acknowledge that most of the problems have been created by this government as a consequence of funding and other cuts that it has made in the last few years.</para><para>He went on in his second reading speech to the House to suggest that universities will, including money collected from students via the HECS system, receive almost $5.6 billion 
 from the government. This is the crucial point. A lot of the money that is now being directed to universities is money that is being recouped from the students themselves. Never before in this country have we seen such a high contribution from individual students. The government cannot afford to claim some kind of credit for increasing funds and funding allocations to universities when a lot of this money is coming from the steep fees and charges that the government has imposed on students.</para><para>He goes on to boast about the fact that the government has allowed universities to offer full fee paying undergraduate courses, enabling students to do the course of their first choice. What rubbish! It enables those students who have money, those students who have wealth, those students who can get loans or who have rich parents and friends, to get the course of their first choice. It certainly does nothing for those disadvantaged students whom Dr Kemp and Minister Vanstone were quite happy to refer to when they were boasting about the merit equity scholarships.</para><para>Dr David Kemp does not end there. He goes on to talk about the assistance being provided to James Cook University and the so-called government commitment to regional universities. I think everybody has recognised what a complete myth that is. That lie has been completely exposed as a consequence of the leaked cabinet submission which targets regional institutions. It acknowledges the difficult financial status that some of those institutions are in—about eight of them, as I recall. So it is acknowledged by this government that they are already facing financial hardship. We had the rescue package introduced by Senator Vanstone a couple of years ago—again an attempt at damage control as a consequence of the 1996 reforms. But that rescue package was specifically targeted at regional and remote universities because the government was starting to understand then that their cuts were going to result in campus closures and indeed—and I will not be surprised if this happens—in institutions shutting down.</para><para>The minister concludes his comments to the House by referring to the merit based equity 
 scholarships scheme. The government should hang its head in shame or at least have the guts to admit that it never really cared about providing access and equity in the first place. If it really did believe its own rhetoric in relation to the scholarships, at a minimum it would be continuing them and not using them as a blatant savings measure under this budget.</para><para>We have seen student-staff ratios up; we have seen fees and charges up, we have seen salaries at a low point due to this government's and the previous government's unwillingness to meet long overdue wage claims by general and academic staff in our higher education institutions. We have seen HECS up, we have seen decline in government funding and we have seen operating grants cuts. It is a sad, sad time for the sector. The only offers of support that David Kemp can come up with include the proposed introduction of vouchers and of fixed interest rates for HECS, or the abolition of HECS or blatant deregulation of fee charging arrangements in the sector when we already have up-front fees for some undergraduate courses and, as a consequence of the reforms of the Labor government, deregulation of the postgraduate sector.</para><para>So this government's agenda is quite clear. It is a narrow vision for higher education. If you couple that with Dr Kemp's almost religious pursuit of his voluntary student unionism legislation—which I recognise is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, so I won't reflect on that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I acknowledge Senator Abetz's interjection.

Those people yelling shame in the chamber understand that it is a misnomer, that voluntary student unionism is not about greater choice for students. It is not about individual choice and responsibility; it is about emasculating those services that are provided on campus that assist all students, 
 but primarily those students who do not necessarily have the same wads of cash as some members in this place, in order to finance their own education, whether that means paying up-front fees and charges, paying for child care or coping with catering, shelter, housing and welfare.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These services mean that campus life is a holistic experience. They mean that people can participate in sport, in recreational facilities, or they can choose not to. In fact, in most cases on campus they can exercise their own conscience. They can make a conscientious objection and not be a joined-up, fully paid-up member of the union. I put it on the record that the Democrats strongly support the conscientious objection clauses which I understand operate in a majority of student union constitutions now and hopefully 100 per cent soon. We recognise that there are some students who need the vital services that are provided by a student organisation on campus. For that reason, the Democrats will continue our long and proud record not only in relation to universal membership of student organisations but also of continuing to vote down any attempt to introduce and increase fees and charges which we see as a psychological and financial disincentive to enter into and participate in higher education in this country.</para><para>We find the reforms that were outlined in the cabinet-in-confidence submission by Dr David Kemp incredibly alarming, and one of the most alarming is the prospect of student loans. This, as callously acknowledged by the minister in his discussion paper, is one of the most contentious elements of the proposed package. We still do not place a lot of faith in the arguments, claims or pledges by the minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in this place—or indeed Dr David Kemp, or indeed the Prime Minister—that they will not introduce these things, because they said the same thing in 1996. At that time they promised they would leave operating grants untampered with.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Crossin interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: I hear your 
 comments, Senator Crossin, about `never ever'. It is no wonder the community is often distrustful of politicians. In this case students will make it clear tomorrow. Students, staff and the community will make it clear to this government that they should not even countenance any of these proposals, that they should not consider any of the suggestions put forward by Dr David Kemp. I believe the students say it best when they say, `Hey, hey, ho, ho: David Kemp has got to go.' The resignation of that minister is long overdue. You need a minister for education who actually believes in the concept of education, who believes that education is an investment in this nation's future, that it is not simply a budget measure from which you can recoup savings but a way of ensuring that all Australians have the opportunity to further their skills and knowledge and participate in a democratic and enlightened society.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Even Roderick West, the author of the West report that Dr David Kemp conveniently buried some time last year—the report contained a number of recommendations which I believe have been resurrected in the cabinet-in-confidence submission—does not support the loan proposal outlined in Dr Kemp's paper. These proposals will subject young Australians to crippling debt burdens just as they are leaving school. We are condemning young people in our nation to debt. In every policy debate that I see taking place in OECD nations, such as the US, France and the UK, policy makers in government are discussing proposals like giving 18-year-olds grants to give them a strong start in their adult life. Yet this government is going in the exact opposite direction by proposing to give young people debts of up to $120,000. That is what we are talking about if we abolish the HECS system. That is what we are talking about if people have to have top-up vouchers or make up some kind of gap payment. That is what we are talking about if people are paying fixed interest rates on their fees and charges. It is extraordinary and disgusting beyond belief that these proposals even made it to paper. The minister should go.</para><para>These proposals are being advanced at a time when access to education by those from 
 lower socioeconomic backgrounds is declining. This government wants to place disincentives, like a debt of $100,000, in the way of Australians. It is even more ironic, and a little disgusting, when you look at some of the education backgrounds of people sitting in this government, indeed on the frontbench. I do not begrudge them their publicly funded higher education. In fact, I think that is the way it should be. But it is interesting to look at a piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>, I believe by Malcolm Farr, which listed a number of members who received their education for free. It listed Peter Costello, the Treasurer; the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge; the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Joe Hockey; the Leader of the National Party of Australia, John Anderson; and of course the Minister for Justice and Customs, Amanda Vanstone. Let us not forget that she was the woman who was wielding the knife in 1996. Larry Anthony would have left the University of New South Wales debt-free. Lucky Mr Anthony. According to this article, the Special Minister of State, who now joins us in the chamber, would also have received a `free ride at the University of Western Australia'. I do not begrudge these people their education, but how dare they begrudge the education of other Australians—not just young people, school leavers, but mature age Australians—whose income, whose lifestyle, whose health and futures, and their children's futures, depend on access to education.

Today I would like to make some further remarks on this most important issue. The situation is becoming more and more clear each day that those who are advocating a no vote, particularly those associated with Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, are intent upon resorting to any sort of scaremongering and, indeed, I would say deliberately misleading and downright false assertions in order to try to ensure that the vote for an Australian head of state does not succeed.</para></talk.start><para>As we know from past referenda, it is often very easy to simply sit on the sidelines, throw in bombs or hand grenades, and thereby scare the Australian public into voting against reasonable and sensible change. That is what I believe is happening on this occasion. For instance, I read an article by Geoffrey Blainey, who referred to the case being put forward by the pro-republicans as similar to Waltzing Matilda. He made references to the swagman, the jumbuck and so on.</para><para>As I have listened to many of the false arguments from the monarchist cause—and I will come to some of those in a moment—I was reminded of an episode in the <inline font-style="italic">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</inline> when Huck and Jim were on the raft and their serenely idyllic world was invaded by two scoundrels. Those two scoundrels claimed that they were descendants of royalty. One of them claimed he was the descendant of the Duke of Bilgewater who had been deprived of his title. The other, not to be outdone, claimed he was the dauphin, the son of Louis XVI and the rightful heir to the throne of France. Huck, of course, saw through these scoundrels and in a rather memorable phrase said:</para><para>It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars weren't no kings nor dukes at all but just low-down humbugs and frauds.</para><para>I would never make that suggestion in respect of the monarchy, but I do make it in respect of those who are out there propagating the cause to retain Queen Elizabeth and her heirs 
 and successors as our head of state. Many of their arguments are fraudulent, and they are nothing more than humbugs.</para><para>Let me turn to some of those arguments. I have already addressed some, as I said, in my speech last week, but let me turn to a few others. One of the arguments that has been advanced is that a constitutional monarchy is inherently better than a republic. That of course is just a completely false assertion. Among stable democracies in the world there are both constitutional monarchies and republics. There is nothing inherently more stable about a constitutional monarchy than there is about a republic. Indeed, we have seen in this century quite a number of monarchies cease to exist because of the despotic and aristocratic nature of their regimes.</para><para>The fact that Australia is a constitutional monarchy does not mean in itself that it is more democratic or more stable. It is a completely false argument to assert that our democracy and stability stem from the simple fact that we are a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as our head of state. Rather I would submit that the fact that we are a stable democratic country that has enjoyed relative peace for 200 years is due more to our geographical position in the world than to the fact that the Queen of England is our head of state.</para><para>Further, the monarchists cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say that our very essence of stable democracy is due to having the Queen, the monarch of the United Kingdom, as our head of state, and yet on the other hand argue that she has really nothing at all to do with the running of this country. Of course, that argument is also being advanced. It is being advanced particularly and continuously by people like Sir David Smith, who argues that in reality the Governor-General is our head of state and the Queen is largely irrelevant. We would submit that she is largely irrelevant to the continued functioning of this stable democratic country. If we move to a system where we have an Australian as our own head of state—someone who lives here, is an Australian citizen, identifies with Australia, is proud of Australia and is able to stand up both within Australia 
 and overseas as a representative of Australia—then we will be just as democratic, just as peace loving and just as stable on 7 November as we are today or on the day before the referendum. So that is a complete furphy.</para><para>The other argument that is advanced—I heard the Prime Minister putting this again this morning—is that the system ain't broke and therefore why change it? I make the point, firstly, that the system is broken. It is not broken in any substantial way that threatens our way of life or our democratic system, but it is broken to the extent that we are one of the few nations on earth that does not have one of its own citizens as the head of state. If it is good enough for the Prime Minister to be an Australian citizen—in fact, it is mandatory for the Prime Minister to be an Australian citizen, as the High Court has found—and if it is important enough for the captain of our cricket team, our Wallaby team or any other group that represents Australia to be an Australian citizen, then why can't an Australian citizen be our head of state? What is so particular and peculiar about that position that it should be reserved exclusively for members of a royal family resident in and ruling the United Kingdom? It is fairly fundamental, I would think, to a nation's stature, to its destiny, to its pride in its history and to its confidence for the future to have one of its own citizens as the head of state. At no stage have those who support the no case from the monarchist cause been able to answer that fundamental question as to why it is that no Australian is worthy enough to hold that position.</para><para>What we have seen in the other great lie is that those from the monarchist cause, such as Kerry Jones, Sir David Smith, Dame Leonie Kramer and others, have been supporting an argument that tries to cash in on the other group opposing the yes campaign, that is, the direct electionists. They, the monarchists, are so bereft of arguments to try and sustain the proposition that the Queen of England should be our head of state that they have jumped onto the direct election bandwagon. So we have Kerry Jones out there promoting a no case on the basis that this model is not the republic we should have—as if somehow she 
 supports some other republican model. When put to the test, she has had to admit that she does not really support any republican model. But if she can, by way of subterfuge or sophistry, win the day and convince people to vote no, she will stoop to any argument. There is no honesty or integrity in that argument at all. Indeed, that has been proved by the fact that the advertisement that was put forward by the monarchist cause, by the no campaign, has actually had to be withdrawn. This is the monarchist anthem, as sung by James Blundell.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Are you going to sing it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—No, I cannot sing it.

What I will focus on is the fact that, whether it is the baker in the kitchen, the old bloke on the land, the grocer down at the market or the guy, the mate, who lends a hand, the fact of the matter is that none of those people can ever be an Australian head of state under our current system. That is the hypocrisy in that anthem: that none of those people who have built this great country can ever aspire to be the head of state.</para><para>The other point I wanted to make in my remarks today is that Australians are not afraid of change. Indeed, we have seen substantial change over the years and, despite the doomsayers, it has not led to the breakdown of the fabric of our society or of our democracy. It was Robert Menzies who in World War II announced that we were at war as a consequence of Great Britain being at war. That was in 1939. Just two years later John Curtin, the then Prime Minister, stated:</para><para>Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.</para><para>We had to cope with change then. We had to cope with a change in our relationship with the United Kingdom in order to save this country. </para><para>Change has continued. We introduced decimal currency and moved away from the system of pounds, shillings and pence, which was the English system. Prime Minister Menzies did that. He actually wanted to call the currency the royal, but we settled for the dollars and cents terminology. We were able to cope with that change, which was a huge change to this economy and an expensive change, but one which represented a break from our imperial past. It was a similar situation when we changed to the metric system rather than having the old inches, feet, yards and miles. Those of us who are old enough remember how hard it was to try and learn that system and to learn our arithmetic. It was another substantial change in this country achieved without any difficulty. We changed our national anthem. It took a number of years, but we changed the anthem. Interestingly enough, we still have <inline font-style="italic">God Save the Queen</inline> as the royal anthem of Australia. Not many people would realise that, if the Queen were opening the Olympic Games, as she is supposed to be entitled to as our head of state, the national anthem to be played when she was opening the Olympic Games would not be <inline font-style="italic">Advance Australia Fair</inline> but would be <inline font-style="italic">God Save the Queen</inline>.</para><para>There have been other changes, including abolition of appeals to the Privy Council, abolition of the imperial honours and so on. The Australian people are able to cope with change, and I believe that we will be able to do so again on 6 November. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tourism</title><page.no>10030</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>10030</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I would like to talk about an issue which is of great interest to me and to Australians as a whole, that is, tourism and tourist development. The tourist industry as a whole provides a significant source of expenditure to the economy and in so doing develops a lot of add-on advantages to regions, such as job creation, regional support and small business growth. Through the regional tourism strategy, the Howard government is making a major contribution to the further development of regional tourism in Australia. </para></talk.start><para>The challenge to all states in Australia is not only to meet the demand of the domestic and international markets but also to rise to the challenge of creating new ways of attracting the tourist dollar as we move into the 21st century.</para><para>As our Minister for Sport and Tourism said earlier in the year, the reality is that domestic tourism rather than international tourism remains the backbone of our tourist industry. Attracting Australians to travel around this country has to be the most productive focus of our tourist industry, because the domestic sector represents about 75 per cent of Australian tourism and is currently worth about $43 billion a year to our economy.</para><para>The industry also represents a significant source of employment, especially for younger Australians and those living in regional areas. In 1995-96 tourism was directly responsible for the employment of around 694,000 people, equivalent to 8.4 per cent of the work force, and a further 334,000 people were also indirectly employed by the tourist industry.</para><para>It is in recognition of the value, both economically and in creating jobs in the tourist industry, that the coalition government has continued to inject significant funds to encourage growth and further development of the tourist industry. This has been particularly so in regional Australia. The coalition government is developing regional initiatives to improve tourist services in terms of diversity, quality and accessibility for the Australian tourist in the regions of this country. The Regional Tourism Program and the domestic tourism campaign received funding totalling $6.1 million in the 1999-2000 budget. The Regional Tourism Program aims to improve the capability of organisations, businesses and individuals to develop and deliver quality tourism products and services in regional Australia.</para><para>Tourism facilities which will benefit from the allocation of this money include visitor information and interpretation centres, tourist attractions and regional signage, projects to raise industry standards, industry leadership initiatives, projects that can be applied across the sector or regions and the development of regional niche markets and tourist attractions. 
 Within this program, the government has also committed funds to be used to establish web sites for regional tourism organisations. Of course, the Internet is the most significant technological advance in our world and the online tourism scoping study of 1999 reported the number of people using the Internet worldwide was somewhere around 151 million. So the use of the Internet as a tool to promote regional tourism is very relevant and important in today's world and something which our government is seeking to encourage.</para><para>The domestic tourism campaign is industry led and aims to encourage more Australians to holiday in Australia rather than going overseas. This measure delivers on the coalition's election commitment for an $8 million contribution towards a joint domestic tourism attitudinal change campaign in which it is the objective to encourage people to see Australia first.</para><para>I would like to focus on the experience of Western Australia, and more particularly regional Western Australia, in discussing the impact of the government's regional tourism program. The Regional Tourism Program is a highly competitive program and I believe that Western Australia has attracted a considerable amount of funding to regional projects from this program to support regional initiatives. The Mid-West Tourist Development Commission, for example, was awarded $100,000 to assist the Batavia Coast Interpretive Centre in Geraldton to establish a stateof-the-art interactive information centre to educate tourists on the rich cultural and maritime history of the mid-west region, including, of course, the history of the Abrolhos Islands and the Batavia wreck and the events that went with that colourful event in Western Australia's maritime history.</para><para>The Kimberley Land Council, which, of course, is the Aboriginal Land Council in the far north of the state, was awarded $70,000 to assist indigenous landowners in the Kimberley to create a new tourist enterprise. This was the Mimbi Caves tourism infrastructure, which will make a substantial contribution to developing indigenous tourism in the area around Fitzroy Crossing. The Mimbi Caves 
 are an enormous system of caves in that area which have not been developed in the past and yet are indeed one of Australia's greatest potential tourist attractions because of their extent and beauty and, of course, because of their indigenous significance.</para><para>In the most recent budget the Regional Tourism Program was allocated $16 million over four years and the applications for grants closed this week. I am very pleased to note that a number of excellent applications were received from Western Australia. Western Australia has a very well organised tourist industry with 10 separate regional development organisations covering the entire state from the far north to the south-west. Each of these regional organisations was developed because it was realised that the pooled resources of local tourist bureaus would be much more effective in promoting tourist development in a regional area than the individual tourist bureaus.</para><para>The first such region to organise itself on a regional basis was the Kimberley, which founded the Kimberley Travel Association in the early 1990s. The KTA, as it has come to be known, has been very successful in promoting the Kimberley as the ultimate outback Australia ecotourism destination and has worked with the Northern Territory tourism authority in particular to promote Northern Australia. Regions such as Esperance, the Kimberley and the Pilbara, which are a significant distance away from the Perth metropolitan area, have the problem of accessibility as a deterrent to tourists coming to those regions—or so it would seem on the face of it. But what seems to be on the face of things is not always the reality. Basic research about the tourists who actually visit an area may sometimes produce unexpected information resulting in the complete reorganisation of the focus of regional tourism promotion.</para><para>For example, the assumption in the north of Western Australia was always that the tourists who came to the Pilbara and Kimberley were largely from the southern areas of Western Australia and, accordingly, promotional advertising was concentrated on the south west. However, in 1994 the Pilbara Devel 
 opment Commission, researching the economic potential of the tourist industry in the area, discovered that in reality a majority of the tourists in the north of Western Australia were from the eastern states, particularly Victoria and New South Wales.</para><para>The reason for this is that most tourists were road-borne retirees and others caravanning around the country, particularly in the warmer winter months. Armed with this basic information, the major focus of the Kimberley and Pilbara Travel Association switched to providing facilities for land-borne tourists and the promotional focus became enticing more caravan tourists who went only as far as Darwin or Alice Springs to cross the border into Western Australia.</para><para>This promotion was successful and had a major flow-on effect for tourism in regions further south in Western Australia because the road-borne tourists were then encouraged to remain in the state and go down to the Gascoyne and mid-west for the wildflower season, explore the attractions of the south-west and exit Western Australia via the Eyre Highway, thus promoting tourism in the Kalgoorlie and Esperance regions.</para><para>Different markets, of course, need different modes of transport and in the Esperance region, for example, the Regional Tourist Authority has produced a regional strategy, funded by the federal government, in association with the Esperance Shire Council, which has resulted in a southern discovery path being developed to provide tourists with an enriched experience of the south-west, Esperance and goldfields area, where the tourists are able to get cheaper access to attractions in those areas.</para><para>To overcome the long distance between attractions in the Kimberley, the Kimberley Travel Association developed an air package, known as the Ibis air pass, which enabled people who purchased the pass to be flown out to major centres, out of the major centres to the more remote destinations in the Kimberley and thus have a broad experience of what the Kimberley had to offer in a short time.</para><para>Infrastructure is a very important factor in tourism development. For example, it can be 
 argued that the tourist potential of roads should be considered when planning where roads should go. Two very good examples of such planning bearing fruit in terms of tourist development are the decisions of the Main Roads Department in Western Australia to build a road from the town of Tom Price to Newman, across the back of the Hamersley Ranges, so giving tourists access to Karijini National Park; and the decision to fund the new location of the Great Northern Highway through the Hamersley Ranges, providing a beautiful scenic drive through that rugged and incredibly impressive scenery for tourists to the area.</para><para>In conclusion, I think the Senate can acknowledge the importance of the tourist industry to Australia and acknowledge also the important contribution the coalition government is making to the development of regional tourism through its regional tourist strategy.</para><para>Australia is a brilliant tourist destination for its citizens and overseas travellers and offers a wealth of experience. The economic flow through to the Australian community by the development of the tourist industry is potentially huge, both in dollar terms and in terms of the employment potential of that industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Appointment of Mr Laurie Foley</title><page.no>10033</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10033</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the adjournment debate on Monday night I outlined the selection process that led to the selection of Mr Laurie Foley to the position of Assistant Director, Aviation Safety Compliance, in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and a report by Mr Stephen Skehill on that process. Specifically I was commenting on the performance of the executive recruitment firm, Spencer Stuart, and the fact that a candidate for the abovementioned position, Mr X, was not included by Mr Wheatley, a company principal, in the list of candidates provided to the authority. This omission by Mr Wheatley meant that the board and Mr Toller did not even know that Mr X, who at the time was a senior authority employee acting in a position that involved a number of the functions to be undertaken by the Assistant Director, Aviation Safety Com 
 pliance, was a candidate for the job. Mr X was also a candidate who, as it transpires, appeared to have a number of supporters on the CASA board. Mr Skehill stated that Mr Pike, the then Acting Director of CASA, said that those on the board best qualified to judge would have regarded Mr X as having performed at a high level in difficult circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>To sum up the performance of Spencer Stuart, Mr Wheatley failed to even tell his client, Mr Toller, about Mr X. He simply did not include him in any list. Mr Wheatley wrote to Mr Toller on 1 June advising on the recruitment progress and attaching a list of `All the contenders'. But Mr Wheatley now cannot find that list.</para><para>In his report to the authority Mr Wheatley used an old report on Mr Y, written in relation to Mr Y's application for the position of CASA Director, not based on his interview with Mr Y for the assistant director position held on 11 May.</para><para>He submitted his final report on applicants 12 and 33 before he had interviewed them. It also appears he failed to provide two negative references on Mr Foley. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to see how Mr Skehill came to the conclusion he did. Mr Skehill found—I say despite the evidence—that there was no basis for criticism of the performance of Spencer Stuart. If I were a member of the CASA board, I would have expected quite a bit more for the board's $250,000.</para><para>I now want to look at the performance of some of the members of the CASA board in this recruitment process. At its meeting on 17 April last year the board approved a new management structure for the authority. That new structure involved the replacement of the deputy director and a number of general manager positions with four assistant director positions, including aviation safety compliance. Mr Skehill concluded that Mr Foley had advised the CASA chair, Mr Dick Smith, of his interest in the position some time after 11 May. Mr Foley and Mr Smith discussed Mr Foley's interest in the job on 14 May and again the following day. Mr Smith claimed to Mr Skehill that, having heard of Mr Foley's interest, he spoke informally to every board 
 member about the matter before the meeting of the CASA board on 15 May. However, Mr Smith's claim to Mr Skehill was wrong. Mr Skehill states in his report:</para><para>I do not accept that he did so, at least at this time.</para><para>And Mr Skehill found that no member of the board recalls Mr Smith advising them. Mr Skehill states:</para><para>A number of them were quite sure that they only became aware of Mr Foley's interest much later.</para><para>Mr Smith and Mr Foley should have formally advised the board of Mr Foley's intentions at that meeting.</para><para>Mr Byron, another member of the board, recollects that he did not know Mr Foley was a candidate until 19 June at the earliest. The CASA board meeting on 5 May was held at Tullamarine airport. That meeting considered the new management structure but the minutes make no reference to the assistant director positions. The only record appears to be a note for file prepared by Mr Willoughby, a board consultant, on 25 May, some 10 days later. According to Mr Willoughby's notes, it appears the board set up a number of panels to interview candidates for the assistant director positions at that meeting. Mr Pyne, a member of the board, nominated for the panel that was to interview candidates for the safety compliance position. There was no reference to Mr Foley's interest in the safety compliance job in either the board minutes or Mr Willoughby's file note. Nor is there any record that Mr Foley absented himself from that part of the board meeting that involved discussion of the position for which he was an applicant.</para><para>Mr Skehill found, however, that some secretariat staff recalled that Mr Foley was absent from that board meeting for a period. It is not clear what period. It appears that Mr Pyne became aware of Mr Foley's application for the job almost by accident as a result of a conversation with Mr Willoughby, the board consultant, on 28 May. According to Mr Skehill, Mr Pyne then sought legal advice on two matters. First, whether Mr Foley was required to resign from the CASA board and, second, whether Mr Pyne could sit on any interview panel where Mr Foley was a candidate. He was advised that there was no legal 
 requirement for Mr Foley to resign and he, Mr Pyne, could legally sit on that assessment panel.</para><para>In a letter to Mr Smith, the chairman, dated 4 June, Mr Foley confirmed he was a candidate for the job. On 16 June, the CASA board met with the minister in Sydney. The structure of CASA management was on the list for discussion. However, Mr Skehill could not find any record of Mr Foley's application for one of the senior positions being discussed.</para><para>The following day Mr Willoughby prepared two documents for the board meeting scheduled for 19 June. The first paper was entitled `The rationale for the organisational structure of the aviation safety compliance division'. The second paper was a summary report on the recruitment process for the four assistant director positions. That report referred to Mr Foley's declaring an interest in the position to the chair. It stated `copy circulated to all board members'. I assume the reference is to the 4 June letter from Mr Foley to Mr Smith. Mr Skehill found that that letter had not been circulated. Mr Skehill checked with all board members and no-one had seen the letter referred to in the Willoughby paper.</para><para>Sometime between 12 June and 19 June it appears that Mr Smith discussed Mr Foley's application with Dr Skully-Power, another member of the board. Dr Skully-Power told Mr Skehill that, until that time, he was not aware that Mr Foley had an interest in that position. In his report Mr Skehill states:</para><para>Dr Skully-Power pressed the view that Mr Foley should resign from the Board before his application was further considered.</para><para>Mr Foley told the CASA board at its 19 June meeting that he planned to resign. He then wrote to the minister to that effect on 22 June. In his report, Mr Skehill further referred to a statutory function of the CASA board being `to ensure that CASA performs its functions in a proper, efficient and effective manner.' He further says:</para><para>To attempt to undertake this function without assessing the reliability of staff of the authority would be a folly.</para><para>He is absolutely correct. In relation to the processes surrounding the recruitment of Mr Foley, the evidence contained in Mr Skehill's 
 report clearly shows that the board failed to properly perform that statutory function that I have just mentioned. However, it is also clear that some board members are innocent victims of that flawed process.</para><para>The process as far as the CASA board was concerned was initially quite proper. There was a selection process to engage a recruitment firm. I said on Monday night and I will say it again, that was despite Mr Willoughby's attempt to avoid that proper process. The board set up a number of panels to assess the applicants for the four assistant director positions. However, beyond that point, the process broke down badly. Mr Foley told Mr Skehill that he advised Mr Smith, the chairman, of his interest in the safety compliance position on 14 May, but at the board meeting the following day neither Mr Smith nor Mr Foley told fellow board members of Mr Foley's intentions.</para><para>The board became a party to what was clearly a highly unsatisfactory and flawed selection process. If the board had known of Mr Foley's intentions at the beginning of its meeting on 15 May, there would be no doubt about whether Mr Foley absented himself from part of that meeting. It appears that he was absent from that meeting for a period but it is not clear what was considered by the board in his absence. I am confident the board would have dealt properly with this matter if it had been properly advised by Mr Smith and Mr Foley, because of the evidence to Mr Skehill from board members Mr Pyne and Dr Skully-Power. The evidence is that Mr Pyne sought legal advice on his own position immediately he became aware of Mr Foley's application for the assistant director position. When Mr Smith told Dr Skully-Power about Mr Foley's application, Dr Skully-Power immediately pressed the view that Mr Foley should resign before his application was further considered.</para><para>I would hope that if Mr Smith and Mr Foley had told that board meeting on 15 May that Mr Foley was a candidate, the interview panel for the safety compliance position would have been constructed quite differently. It appears that at the board meeting on 19 June, the board may have contemplated aban 
 doning the panel arrangements for interviews for the Foley position but, again, that is not clear. It is clear that after that board meeting Mr Smith, Mr Toller and Mr Willoughby decided that the panel interview structure had to be abandoned for Mr Foley for obvious reasons—that panel structure involved board members. This selection process also highlighted the fact that the records of the CASA board were nothing short of a shambles and that the whole board must be held accountable for that important failing.</para><para>When I was pursuing this matter through the estimates process, that fact became very clear to me. There are now on the record a number of different answers to the same questions. That is, questions that I asked at estimates received certain answers, those answers are in substantial part different from answers which Mr Skehill received and which he has published in his report, and he has noted the deficiency in the answers given to the Senate through the estimates process. That matter itself is one that I intend to pursue further, and I do not think I need to tell senators why. It is pretty clear that where an authority gives incorrect answers and then knows them to be incorrect, they have an obligation to correct them. They have not done so.</para><para>I must also advise the Senate that there is in existence an inquiry which, in general terms, goes to the question of the administration of aviation safety. At a meeting of the committee this morning I inquired as to whether it was proper for this matter to be considered in the context of that Senate inquiry. I have been advised by the secretariat that it is consistent with the terms of reference of that inquiry that this matter be so considered. I have advised the committee that it is my wish that interested parties who wish to present material to the committee on that matter should be advised to do so. So far as I am able to do that now, I encourage those people who have information to come forward.

That government has issued a declaration which would ban the import of salmon products from New Zealand and, indeed, anywhere else while it undertakes a risk analysis in accordance with the requirements of the World Trade Organisation.</para></talk.start><para>It was somewhat disturbing to see the minister almost threaten the state with High Court action. The state has a right under the Constitution to take the course of action that it has taken, and it has that right to proceed to conduct the risk analysis as is allowed for under WTO rules. What is even more disturbing about Minister Truss's statements is where he said:</para><para>The action was political grandstanding because all the scientific evidence indicated New Zealand salmon had a very similar health status to Australian salmon.</para><para>That is just patently wrong.</para><para>I would have thought a minister of the Commonwealth government—this being such a significant issue that has been to the WTO now on at least three occasions—at least ought to have been briefed to a degree of understanding about the issue, because the New Zealand salmon do not have the same health status. There is a disease known as whirling disease, which is found in New Zealand and not found in Australia.</para><para>With regard to the whole process of this issue, which is also now the subject of a Senate inquiry, what has been completely overlooked by the government in threatening the state of Tasmania is that, first, it has a 
 right under the constitution to proceed that way; and, secondly, it would seem that the minister is totally unaware of the circumstances that surround some of these diseases.</para><para>I would be very interested to hear whether the minister would have the same view if it came down to an issue that related to cattle or sheep diseases or, indeed, wheat diseases. I would be very interested to hear from the government as to whether or not they would take the same view if the states of Western Australia and New South Wales took it upon themselves to, say, ban the importation of beef, lamb, wheat, or rice from somewhere else on the basis that they had a concern about a disease. I suspect not. I suspect the government would not threaten those states.</para><para>I say to the government on this occasion that it has a department that has monumentally stuffed up this issue in respect of salmon imports—and that is recognised and acknowledged even by the WTO's own panel of experts. It really begs the question how the department, the body that is charged with the responsibility for monitoring and applying quarantine measures in this country and making determinations on quarantine measures in this country, arrived at the decision that it did, and secondly got itself into the position that it did in the WTO. On the basis of this, we were one of the principal architects and negotiators involved in the development of the sanitary and phyto-sanitary agreement that now has application through the WTO.</para><para>Coming back to the specific case of salmon imports: following an application to the WTO by Canada first, followed and joined by the US, to have removed the restrictions on salmon imports that had been in place since 1975, AQIS in 1995 prepared a draft risk analysis. This was on the basis that the application from Canada was for wild, ocean-caught Pacific salmon—not farm salmon.</para><para>AQIS prepared a risk analysis in respect of 24 diseases that those fish could be subject to and found that, while the restrictions should not be totally lifted, they should be changed so as to allow fresh and/or frozen ocean-caught Pacific salmon to be imported into Australia. </para><para>In 1996, AQIS presented a final report. That final report was on much the same basis of the application of Canada and joined by the US, but on this occasion it brought down findings that said the restrictions should be kept in place. An interesting part about that was that it would appear that the scientific information did not change. Given that the draft risk analysis was provided to Canada and to the US and subsequently they got the final risk analysis, I am not surprised that they would be a little curious that a country that in the first instance does a risk analysis and says, `Oh, well, we think it is okay,' secondly, not even 12 months later, just some months later, comes out with a conclusion that says, `No, it is not okay.' I can understand Canada and the US saying, `What are these people on about? They seem to be somewhat inconsistent.'</para><para>Of course, fish importation issues have been around for some time because governments of both political persuasions have looked at and had inquiries into the practices relating to fish imports and, of course, the import of other products as well. There was the Nairn report that made various recommendations and, in part, we in government started to proceed down the track to do something about that and it was overtaken by the 1996 election. When this government came in we had very strong statements from the minister then, following the 1996 report, that the restrictions would stay in place.</para><para>We did all of this—and AQIS did this—in the full knowledge of the WTO requirements, the requirements of an agreement of which we were one of the principal architects. I am at a loss to understand how the body responsible for the application of, the decision-making of, quarantine restriction measures in this country got it so terribly wrong. It has been implied by the Prime Minister that this is about trade, but this is not a trade issue. The 75 restrictions were put in place not to protect the salmon industry of Tasmania—or anywhere else, albeit it principally operates in Tasmania—because it did not exist then. They were put in place to protect the recreational trout fisheries of this country, which has applica 
 tion in a number of states, not just Tasmania. That is why they were put in place.</para><para>So we proceed to look at the problems associated with the diseases. We are told by the WTO, using an agreement and aspects of the sanitary and phyto-sanitary agreement that we were the principal architects of, that we must conduct a comprehensive risk analysis. They give us a very short period of time to do it. In this instance it does not have application only to wild, ocean-caught Pacific salmon. It has application to all salmonid product from anywhere in the world. So we conduct that risk analysis.</para><para>One very important disease is included in the process, the disease known as infectious salmon anaemia. It has been found in Norway since 1984. It has spread throughout northern Europe and into Canada and maybe in parts of the US. There is some scientific opinion as to how it is spread, but there is no conclusive proof. There is also scientific opinion that the disease spread as a result of trade in fish product. That is a fact. I find it amazing that there is no clinical test available to identify infected fish, unless they show clinical signs of infection—that is, they have blotches and appear very sick. At this point in time, unless the fish show signs of the disease and can be visibly identified to have it, no other test is available to identify which infected fish have the disease.</para><para>I am quite amazed that we failed to argue this case very strongly. The general public of Australia should know that in Norway nowadays salmon farming is very significant, in Australia it is very small. We represent just a drop in the ocean in respect of salmon farming in the world. But in Norway salmon farming is a big industry and a very powerful lobbier of government. When Norway gets an outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia in any of the waterways, what do they do? They use a poison called rotenol and they poison the rivers and waterways, no matter how big, and they kill everything. They do that for at least three years.</para><para>As someone who has a recreational interest in fishing, I know that if you go to Norway, the only fish you can catch nowadays are those that are released by farms. You cannot 
 catch any wild fish because they have basically wiped them out. The same thing is happening elsewhere.</para><para>We know that there is a major problem in net caged salmon farming in many parts of the world with regard to wild fish stocks. We know that it has been scientifically proven that wild fish stocks are declining at such a rate that it is likely that in most of the northern hemisphere wild salmonids will not exist in the next 10 to 15 years.</para><para>In Canada, the wild Atlantic salmon stocks have reached such a level—this is what I find very interesting—that the United Nations has taken steps to stop commercial fishing of wild Atlantic salmon. That means no commercial fishing. In places like Newfoundland there is no commercial fishing. The United Nations knew that if it did not take those steps the genetics of wild Atlantic salmon could not continue. In fact, it believes at the moment that it is highly likely that there are sufficient stocks for them to continue.</para><para>I say to the government and to AQIS, who have bungled this monumentally, that they have an opportunity to right the wrong. They should do it and, most of all, they should not threaten the state that is actually trying to do the right thing. Tasmania should be joined by other state Premiers in fighting this battle because right now the Commonwealth is incapable of doing so on the basis that it has no interest in the fresh water environs of this country. I suggest to the government that they listen long and hard about that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para> Sitting suspended from 1.44 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>10038</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: MRI Scans</title><page.no>10038</page.no></subdebateinfo><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>10038</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity of representing the minister for health.

We have always been up-front about our intentions in relation to Telstra and I think the public have respected us for that. We made it clear, we took the risks, we accepted that there were significant segments of the population who either were opposed to it or had been persuaded that they should be opposed to it. Nonetheless, we were able to demonstrate that there were very significant benefits that would flow, not just in terms of reducing public sector debt but in ensuring that the money was used for sensible capital works programs. And, of course, the billion dollar social bonus package that we took to the last election I think went a long way towards alleviating a lot of concerns in rural areas about the quality of telecommunications services.</para></talk.start><para>What I suppose really sticks in the craw of all those who are interested in this debate is that, when in government, you had Mr Beazley—now the Leader of the Opposition but at various stages in a crucial position to affect privatisation—being the great privatiser himself. He was the finance minister when the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas were sold off, after, of course, the government had given an ironclad guarantee that they would not—that they had no intention whatever to—further reduce their shareholding. Mr Beazley, 
 in fact—as we all know—went to the Press Club and trenchantly justified the whole notion of privatisation. He said it did not result in a loss of infrastructure; it was merely a transfer of ownership—and, of course, he has argued the case long and hard in government.</para><para>What do we now find? Of course, he is the strongest opponent of privatisation. Why? Obviously for purely tactical reasons, and yet again today we have him being exposed by Mr Blount, the former CEO of Telstra, saying yesterday that a senior Hawke government minister had told him that the Labor Party were committed to privatisation. He said he was told about the plan during a confidential meeting before his appointment to head Telstra was known. In other words, the only reason he came out here was that he was on a promise. What happened, of course, was that he was well and truly conned: he was brought out here under false pretences because they reneged on the deal.</para><para>Who was involved in that? Who made that promise? We know one thing for sure: Mr Beazley was the minister for communications at the time. And what Mr Blount says is that the whole purpose of his trip was to see if it was really doable to be the CEO of a company owned 100 per cent by the government; it was all about trying to explore this with the government and with the minister of the day. Well, who was the minister of the day? So it is quite clear that Mr Beazley has a lot of explaining to do. He has put out a statement today saying:</para><para>I have never suggested to Mr Blount that I was in favour of Telstra privatisation, and Mr Blount said that I had made no such suggestion to him.</para><para>The alternative explanation is that he was actually present when other ministers argued in favour of privatisation but, unfortunately, he did not quite have the ticker to express a private reservation. That is highly unlikely, I have to say, because he privatised everything else he could get his hands on. Let us just assume that, for some reason, he did not quite want to go that far—mainly because the unions would not let him and all of the rest. So he just sat there quietly. He let Mr Blount believe that the Labor Party was in favour of 
 privatisation and that they did want to see Telstra in private hands. He said nothing. That is the alternative explanation.</para><para>It is a very tragic state of affairs that you cannot have someone come clean on one of the biggest policy issues of the moment—in fact, of the decade. Mr Beazley's weasel words on this subject do him no credit at all. It ought to be clear to anyone who looks at what Mr Blount has had to say that he does not contradict Mr Beazley. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Health and Aged Care: Fundraising</title><page.no>10040</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>10040</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Ellison, the Special Minister of State.

As I am sure Senator Harris knows, under our great federation the states have primary responsibility for management of our most precious resource—water. In relation to the Murray River, New South Wales, regrettably, manages its water resources so that only a minimum water reserve is carried over into the following year. This is a significant contrast to the state of Victoria, which keeps much more significant volumes of water in reserve for the following season. The fact is that Victorian farmers, therefore, do have a higher level of water security than those in New South Wales. I do think that the New South Wales government does need to come to grips with this issue of effective water management in order to give its own farmers much more water security.</para></talk.start><para>New South Wales farmers who rely on the Murray have been experiencing considerable difficulty. There have been drought conditions and they have experienced, regrettably, the failure of the New South Wales government to give them proper water security. The New South Wales government approached the Snowy Mountains Council seeking access to additional water releases. We are, with Victoria and New South Wales, members of that council. I certainly passed on to the Commonwealth representatives on that council, for whom I have responsibility, that I wanted to see a speedy and satisfactory resolution of this. Certainly, my office was in close contact 
 with the office of the then Victorian Premier to ensure that Victoria cooperated fully in this matter, and indeed Victoria did cooperate in ensuring that we got an outcome. The outcome was that, at the Snowy Mountains Council meeting last week, the council agreed to the New South Wales government's request, on behalf of the irrigators, that 300 gigalitres of additional water be made available.</para><para>I think it is important to remember in the face of the protests from the irrigators that have been going on that the scheme is already committed to supplying some 2,000 gigalitres to the irrigators, which I am advised is the equivalent of four times the volume of Sydney Harbour, and that there is no charge from the Snowy Mountains Council for that release. What is being asked for is water in addition to what is already a very significant allocation from the Snowy Mountains Scheme. What the council is doing is allowing the irrigators to bring forward a portion of next year's allocation to supplement this year's allocation. That is something we support. It is being provided on a quasi-commercial basis and it is in accord with the New South Wales government's request. As I say, and I want to stress, this has been brought about by the inadequacies of the New South Wales government's management of its water resources. It has sought a solution through the release, or the insurance provided by the guarantee of a release, of water from the Snowy scheme. We have responded positively to that.</para><para>We have supported the New South Wales government's request that water be supplied on that basis, and I am pleased to say it will be. The farmers, of course, are saying that it ought to be provided for free; that was not the original request and it certainly was not the New South Wales government's proposition that it put to the council. We supported the proposition put by the New South Wales government. The water is being provided at rates which I understand are at actually half the rate, half the price, originally proposed.

Both of those instances now leave the pastoralists and the rice growers in New South Wales receiving only 11 per cent of their allocation.

The council was approached for this, in effect, insurance scheme by way of a guarantee of 300 gigalitres to be made available if required so that the farmers would be able to plant now, knowing that that water will be available if they need it. We hope they will not need it; we hope there will be sufficient rain so that they will not need it. We have responded positively to that. We are in accord with the New South Wales government.

The creation of a 
 national police force by the Fraser government in 1979 was a response to Australia's developing international links. It was becoming clear that an increasingly mobile world population meant that borders alone were no barrier to serious crime. At the end of the 1990s, we can see new forms of crime and smarter ways of committing old crimes. Crime is now global. The criminals who inflict most damage on our community are sophisticated business people who command criminal enterprises stretching across the globe. They feed off drug smuggling, arms dealing, money laundering, technology based fraud and paedophile networks that span the globe and use the Internet in other ways. It is much more than the old break-and-enter or handling stolen videos. In that context, intelligence needs to guide and shape police operations, strategy and policy rather than simply support isolated investigations.</para></talk.start><para>Traditional policing was reactive rather than proactive—a bit like firemen waiting around a station waiting around for someone to yell out that there was some smoke. Intelligence played a part but it did not actually drive or lead police work. Proactive policing means carefully selecting the targets that will maximise the impact on criminal activity. New technologies are providing ever widening opportunities for the development of sophisticated tools to support intelligence analysis.

I have a good news story today. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that this morning the government launched the $11 million Indigenous Small Business Fund. The fund is another element of the Howard government's $115 million indigenous employment policy, which forms part of our ongoing commitment to creating real employment opportunities for indigenous Australians. I congratulate the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, and his department for their dedication and hard work in putting this policy together.</para></talk.start><para>I am also pleased that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Chairman, Gatjil Djerrkura, has so strongly supported the government's initiatives.

The government and ATSIC both recognise we must increase the economic independence of our people.</para><para>Madam President, you would be aware that since taking over this portfolio this has been one of the strengths of what we have contributed over the last 3½ years to Aboriginal people in the sense that we have supported them in their desire for economic independence and real jobs.</para><para>Under this $11 million Indigenous Small Business Fund, a total of $6 million will be provided by the government and another $5 
 million in funding will come from ATSIC. The Indigenous Small Business Fund will foster the development of businesses owned, operated and managed by indigenous people and help to promote sustained employment opportunities. Funds will be provided to indigenous organisations to develop services which provide entrepreneurship and business facilitation training. That has been one of the deficiencies up to date. It will also clarify business opportunities, develop business plans and proposals, and provide support and advice services to indigenous small business owner-operators in developing their skills, markets and networks.</para><para>As I have previously told the Senate, this government has sought to do things differently in indigenous affairs and we are starting to see the results. Three and half years ago I might not have said that I regarded my portfolio with enthusiasm, but what I have seen in the last 3½ years has encouraged me to the extent that I believe there is a sea change occurring in Aboriginal affairs in this country as a direct result of those people who are seeking out business opportunities and looking for education. As I mentioned the other day, we now have 44,000—one in five adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—who are going through vocational education and training courses. I have been fortunate to meet many talented, hardworking indigenous Australians with successful business ventures and terrific business ideas.</para><para>We have sought to foster economic empowerment among indigenous Australians through education, training, the creation of jobs and the development of successful indigenous businesses. I am pleased to say that the government has assisted in the creation of many indigenous enterprises over the past three years, including Queensland Bulk Haulage and, as I mentioned previously, Harbour Dreaming. I had the great pleasure recently of being part of the official launch of both those businesses which are providing indigenous Australians with jobs, income and a future. Queensland Bulk Haulage is but one. If Senator Ferris wishes to ask me about other businesses, I would be happy to provide her 
 with further information, because there are so many.</para><para>Queensland Bulk Haulage at Cloncurry in north-western Queensland has just opened a new transport depot and was awarded the road haulage contract by Ernest Henry Mining to transport copper-gold concentrate.

 been recognised by and been given priority under this government with tax reform and earlier initiatives of this government, and that has been recognised by retiree organisations. There has been a very favourable response from both customers and industry to the introduction of the new income stream rules.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Since 20 September last year, changes to means testing rules for the pension have seen the sales of long-term income stream products increase significantly. For instance, the sales of lifetime and term annuities have increased 46 per cent in the year to June. Similarly, the sales of short-term products have declined. This is the behaviour the legislation was intended to encourage. These developments are welcomed by the government as they help to ensure that retired Australians are receiving regular secure income throughout their retirement years. The long-term security of these products is an attractive feature to many retirees, and the government welcomes the large scale take-up of the products.</para><para>Since September 1998, figures have shown that the sales of long-term assets test complying products have increased markedly over the previous year. The coalition has a solid record in support of pensioners and seniors generally. The linking of pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings has meant that the maximum partnered rate has increased by $11 a fortnight for each person, more than would have applied with the cost of living increases alone. Expanding the entitlement for the Commonwealth seniors health card has meant that up to 220,000 self-funded retirees are now eligible for that card for the first time.</para><para>We have expanded carers' initiatives. We have introduced the pension bonus scheme. Taxpayers are able to contribute to their spouses' superannuation—which is terribly important for women in caring roles, for example. The provision of retirement savings accounts has provided flexibility for people. The health insurance rebate helps 850,000 over-65-year-olds and over 700,000 low income families. The pension payday is giving people choice and flexibility and there are now free annual health check-ups for 
 over-75 year-olds, the majority of whom are women.</para><para>A prime concern of our government is that pensioners and retirees receive their fair share of the benefits of tax reform. Pensioners and seniors will greatly benefit under tax reform from lower income tax rates and a higher tax threshold. We have abolished provisional tax, which was a Labor tax. We have abolished sales tax, another Labor tax, financial institutions duty and the bank accounts debits tax. Pensioners and low income retirees will not pay a cent of taxation until their income reaches $14,500 for a single person or $24,500 for a couple. Pensioners and retirees may be eligible for bonus payments of up to $1,000 or $3,000 respectively, depending on their income and savings.</para><para>An additional 45,000 current self-funded retirees will become eligible for age pensions due to the relaxation of the pension income assets test. That gives them access to pensioner concession cards and all the associated benefits. Pensioners will be able to keep up to 60c in the dollar from their private income—that is up by 10c in the dollar. When selling that business to retire it will be free of capital gains tax—once again, Labor's tax. That all contrasts with Labor's recent appalling record and the `l-a-w law' tax cuts, which were not delivered.

Senator Lundy asked a pretty simple question: what was the number of women on the Howard government's advisory committees on the GST and what was the role that OSW played in relation to the ANTS package, and GST in particular? It came as no surprise to people on this side of the chamber that the minister did not know. Why would the minister not know? It is because the minister does not go to OSW estimates. In fact, in the three years that I have been in the Senate since this government has been in power, I do not think the minister has ever gone to an OSW estimates.

Ms Goward confirmed that OSW was not formally consulted in relation to the ANTS package and GST in particular. To their credit, off their own bat, they put a submission to the government in relation to the ANTS package but they were not formally consulted. This is in relation to a piece of legislation that is probably one of 
 the most significant over the last couple of decades.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One may say, looking at the record of this government in relation to women: why would the government bother asking the OSW in relation to the ANTS package? They probably would not want to hear it. Given their record on women, why would they bother with the consultation? There is a very good reason, and that is that the Prime Minister himself issued an edict that all legislation had to be considered by the Office of the Status of Women. On the ANTS package the OSW was not given the opportunity to be consulted in relation to it or to provide feedback. I wonder why. Is it because they would not have liked what they heard or is it more the case that they forgot? I suspect they forgot to consult the Office of the Status of Women.</para><para>This is extraordinary. Even some of the most unreconstructed ministers on the other side of the chamber in estimates are aware of the Prime Minister's edict that the OSW needs to be consulted.

People listening would need to understand that Senator Newman is not required to be at those estimates. Senator Hill attends those estimates as the minister representing the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. But let me remind people that, when Dr Lawrence was minister for women's affairs and she had women's roundtables, she would float in at the beginning, say a few words to people and float out again. When Senator Newman became the minister for women's affairs, the roundtable commented on the fact that she stayed for the whole time. She actually stays and listens. In fact, the roundtables were set up as a mechanism for consulting in the states.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Newman was asked by the other side about a Beijing Plus 5 preparatory meeting in the Philippines. After the question was asked, Senator Newman received advice from DFAT that no meeting on Beijing Plus 5 was held in the Philippines that they were aware of. There was an NGO meeting on Beijing Plus 5 in Bangkok at that time. Let us ask the opposition to go back, start again, get a new questions committee and get Senator Conroy to ring Uncle Robert—Senator Ray—in New York to get his advice on questions, because the opposition has been doing abysmally since he has been away.</para><para>Senator Newman was also asked a question about advertising in the disability area. We need to go back and remind the Labor Party—they need to be reminded constantly of what they did in government—that their policy was to close down what were then called sheltered workshops because they had the view that every single person in a sheltered workshop—now called a business enterprise—was capable of open employment. We had one of the most moving times in the Senate when people spoke about some of the problems associated with employing people with disabilities. Former Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen spoke about her role as patron of an organisation that runs a large number of 
 sheltered workshops. Senator Herron got up and made a most profound speech as the father then of a young woman with a severe disability who was in a sheltered workshop.</para><para>That speech shamed the Labor Party and shamed Senator Tate into demanding that the then minister, Mr Howe, do something about it. The road we were on was one of closing down sheltered workshops. It was an absolutely appalling policy. That is the sort of thing Labor did for people with disabilities. That is the sort of record they had. They had to back off and change because they were made aware by the people running what are now called business enterprises and by the parents that there was a place for employing young people with profound disabilities in an environment where they were safe and secure and could be trained and that, hopefully, some of them would move into open employment.</para><para>The other thing the opposition did when it was advertising the disability reform package—and Senator Newman has been criticised about advertising on disability issues—was to give a $5 million contract to a company called Corporate Impacts. That company was balance sheet insolvent when it got the contract, but nobody did a Dun and Bradstreet check on the company. So what happened? It was a contract that was let with no lead department—Social Security, Education and Health were involved in it. It went down the drain. One of the outcomes was that little companies that employed people with disabilities did not get their money. Not only did the advertising project fail but also people with disabilities were left without money, and the information was not passed on. That is the opposition's record in government. So to come in here and criticise Senator Newman is absolutely over the top. The opposition needs to be doing something about getting some policies of its own, getting on with it, and being a decent opposition. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10055</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Newman has well deserved the criticism after today. Today was a perfect example: a number of questions were asked of Senator Newman, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, and when she did not have a brief, 
 she could not answer the question. When she did have a brief, she just read it off, like anyone can do when reading a speech. She was asked a number of questions today and she floundered. To a question I specifically asked her in relation to a meeting that was held overseas in the Philippines, she talked about how she had just returned from China. She told us about the Office of the Status of Women and what activities they have planned for next month. That had nothing at all to do with the question that I had asked. The question she was asked was: why did we fail to send an official to that meeting overseas? Not only that—why did we not send a female representative, as we saw with the delegation that went to the ILO conference? Who else did not send any representation to that meeting overseas? Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Islamic Republic of Iran—not countries, with all due respect, that you would hold up on a pedestal as having an astounding record in relation to what they do for women. So we have now joined that category, have we? In relation to this minister and her portfolio, that would be right.</para></talk.start><para>Let us move on to Ms Goward leaving the Office of the Status of Women. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is not dealing with that recruitment; Morgan &amp; Banks are. Let us ask ourselves this: why has Ms Goward chosen to go? Is it because the Prime Minister desperately needs a spokesperson on the Olympics? No, he has got that—he has a minister for sport. Or is it because Ms Goward said, `I'm pretty tired of the fact that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet keep changing my briefs and changing my letters, won't allow me to invite who I want to invite to the roundtable, won't allow me to have the consultations that I want to have with women in the community and won't allow me to put in place the initiatives that I want'?</para><para>Is it not a fact—and members of the public may want to consider this—that in whatever Ms Goward has tried to do over the course of her employment, she has been stopped time and time again by particular people in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet? Is it not a last resort that—instead of 
 resigning and causing Senator Newman the ultimate embarrassment—she has been offered another sweetener by the Prime Minister? So I dangle that idea for people of the public and for people in the press gallery to contemplate. She is a strong person—why has she not been able to have the influence that the head of the Office of the Status of Women ought to have?</para><para>Why do we not have a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women who is able to represent women across the board? How do women from a non-English speaking background now feed in their concerns to this government? They do not get funding; they have not been invited to the roundtable. How do people from the Justice Coalition or from women's legal centres survive? How do people who are running community based organisations such as the Girl Guides, who have had their funding reduced from $50,000 to $20,000, feel? In the annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which was tabled last week, we saw that around 50 to 60 organisations were invited to the roundtable last year, and this year we see that there are only going to be 20 and a certain number of individuals. Hand-picked by whom? By Jocelyn Newman? By the Prime Minister? By the Office of the Status of Women? That is yet to be revealed, and we may never know the answer to that.</para><para>In closing, one thing I want to say in relation to the performance of this minister is that the National Council of Women was one of the three organisations that received funding to establish a secretariat, but it does not have a presence in the Northern Territory, the electorate which I represent. What kind of research was undertaken to ensure that women right around this country—not just those on the eastern seaboard—are represented and share in the money that is dished out to women's organisations? The YWCA and the BPW in the Northern Territory have a base in Darwin only. So rural and remote women of this country miss out once more, but it is not surprising under this minister. It is what women of Australia have come to expect, and they do not like it. They do not like the fact that they are being marginalised, being si 
 lenced and do not have the opportunity to be listened to by this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>10056</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak on this taking note of answers, I want to refer briefly to the comments made by those on the other side in relation to Senator Newman's participation, particularly in the estimates on the Office of the Status of Women. As a member, for example, of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, I spend—as Madam Deputy President West does—hours and hours in those estimates hearings, more often than not with Senator Newman in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Any suggestion whatsoever that she does not do her job, that she does not fulfil her role in that regard, is one which I would absolutely reject and which should be rejected. It is a very unfortunate reflection on the minister and on my colleague the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, who does an extraordinarily good job in that role in the Office of the Status of Women estimates, in particular in his capacity as a former shadow minister in that very portfolio. So it cannot be said that he is without skills or experience in that regard.</para></talk.start><para>Speakers opposite have addressed this afternoon the role of the Office of the Status of Women. There are a couple of points that I want to make in relation to this government's achievements and initiatives for women—in which the OSW has played a significant role—and I think it is important that those are on the record. Let us talk very briefly about those in the general economic area first. There is no regard whatsoever paid to the $13 billion of income tax cuts, and increased assistance to families to the extent of $2½ billion is completely ignored. That benefit to women is completely ignored by those opposite.</para><para>Let me refer briefly to some health measures which I have spoken about in this chamber before. What about the special measures for women's health which have included $8.2 million for a fly-in-fly-out female general practitioner service for rural Australia—for 
 some of the very areas that Senator Crossin was just referring to? There is also an extra $4.1 million for specialised health care for women diagnosed with breast cancer and a further $8.1 million for the National Breast Cancer Centre—in fact, I think next week is National Breast Cancer Week. These are achievements and initiatives of this government for Australian women which are worth recording and noting for the record.</para><para>Under this government, women's participation in paid work is recognised as vital to their economic security. Around 64 per cent of working age women participate in the paid labour force. Since the government took office in 1996, employment for women has increased by almost 260,000 from March of that year, an increase of 7.2 per cent. In August of this year, just a couple of months ago, the unemployment rate for women reached seven per cent, its lowest level since 1990. These are figures which ought to be on the record and should be recognised by those opposite as important figures for women in the community.</para><para>One of the programs that I have referred to previously in the chamber is the $22.4 million for the Return to Work Program for people—mainly women in this particular component—who are seeking to return to the work force after an absence for two or more years due to parenting or caring responsibilities. This is an important support initiative. It recognises that people who are out of the work force for a particular period of time may need some support at re-entry, whether it is in training or in development of skills to actually go through the job interview process. All of those elements are there and are being supported by the government in the Return to Work Program. But is there any acknowledgment of that from the other side? None whatsoever.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Work and family state of play</inline> report has provided more solid evidence of the success of the government's efforts in promoting more family friendly workplaces. About 67 per cent of certified agreements and 79 per cent of AWAs approved under the Workplace Relations Act now include one or more family friendly measures. We have recently reviewed 
 the operation of the Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act to ensure that it operates more effectively for both women and business. In relation to search issues, which have been raised in the chamber today, the government remains committed to increasing diversity amongst Australian decision makers. We have extended the Executive Search Pilot Program and what is known as the early warning system initiatives for Commonwealth boards and provided funding towards the National Women's Leadership Project to promote women onto private sector boards. These are all important initiatives and these are all components of the government's efforts in relation to our achievements and initiatives for women, and all should have greater recognition than they have received from those opposite.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>10057</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Gibbs asked perhaps the most significant question asked today in this debate, and it was later followed up by Senator Faulkner. Both those people asked about the basis upon which the person who will run the Office of the Status of Women is going to be chosen. Clearly, this side of the chamber is very concerned to ensure that that person is chosen according to criteria that will best serve not only the women of Australia but people in Australia generally. You have to understand that when we talk about women of Australia we are talking about citizens, and very vital citizens, whether they be women in their nineties who live alone, who have raised a family and who have now become great-grandmothers; whether they be women who have raised a family but are still working hard in various professions and in various jobs and professions, performing well in those roles; or whether they be younger women who adorn our sports fields or work in offices or run companies.</para></talk.start><para>There is a whole spread of women, and I would have thought that the person who is going to fill the office that looks after that range of people is very important and that the selection should not be left to Morgan and Banks. I am not big on people who specialise in getting people employed. It seems extraordinary to me that a government is not in a 
 position to know exactly what it wants in terms of the person who is going to look after the interests of women. Why would you go off to a firm like Morgan and Banks? Who are Morgan and Banks? What are the criteria that have been given to Morgan and Banks for them to test? I have always had great problems with getting people selected to positions by some company that holds out an expertise. For example, Senator Susan Ryan adorned the Senate when we were down the hill. Senator Hill will remember Senate Ryan well. If Senator Ryan were still here, this is a job she would undertake personally because she would attach a great deal of importance to it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—I thought that for an ALP minister she was very able.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Hill said she was able.

The government should have gone about the choice of this office as an exercise of the greatest importance. Senator Faulkner would bear this out, and so would Senator Hill. I do not think for one moment that the Prime Minister when he is choosing his cabinet goes off to Morgan and Banks. Perhaps he does. Perhaps the people in the party room are interviewed by Morgan and Banks to see whether or not they should have a ministry! If the Prime Minister and his office do not go off to Morgan and Banks to choose the ministry, why does the Prime Minister go off there to choose a person of almost equal importance, I would suggest, that is, the person who is going to look after the various concerns that women may have? As I say, there is such a wide range of women who work hard trying to bring up their children, whether they be women on the factory floor, women who work in the shop or professional women. Across that broad range of people, they need to be properly cared for, and the person who is going to be in charge of the Prime Minister's concern for them should be 
 chosen according to proper criteria and should be chosen by the Prime Minister and by the cabinet itself. That is what should happen. I think Morgan and Banks should butt out and others should come in. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>10058</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Speaking generally, I believe this government has delivered on its commitments to enhance opportunities for Australian women through strong economic growth, tax reform and better and simpler assistance for families and those in need.

The state loves you somehow—that is what they believe, but we do not believe in that. This government has also given around $20 million for respite support for carers of younger people with profound 
 and severe disabilities, and an extra $8.2 million for carers of dementia sufferers. But I would like to conclude on this: the subliminal text of the ALP is that real women vote Labor. Real women vote Liberal and most have in the history of this country, and we support them—as outlined by Senator Payne and Senator Newman.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>10059</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>10059</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline> to move, on 23 November 1999:</para><para>That the following matters be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 June 2000:</para><para>(a)	 an examination of current standard setting for telecommunications equipment in Australia, including the role of government, industry, consumers, public health authorities and research;</para><para>(b)	 the effectiveness of current standards, public information and product labelling in protecting public health in relation to:</para><para>	 (i)	 electromagnetic emissions (EME) and exposures from electrical power distribution systems in residential areas, and</para><para>	 (ii)	 EME and exposures from telecommunications products, including but not limited to the radiofrequency emissions from mobile phones;</para><para>(c)	 the adequacy of current funding for research into EME, possible sources of funding and a review of the Commonwealth's fund of $4.5 million for research and public information;</para><para>(d)	 the current status of the World Health Organization examination of studies on health risks associated with exposure to EME;</para><para>(e)	 an examination of currently available research into the health risks of EME, with particular reference to whether growing children, the aged, the sick, and the genetically susceptible are threatened by such exposures; and</para><para>(f)	 any other associated matters.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to move, on the next day of sitting:</para><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Economics References Committee on the

It fronts the historic Treasury Gardens to the south and Fitzroy Gardens to the east.</para><para>The building is part of Melbourne's Treasury Reserve heritage precinct which comprises a group of public buildings, dating from 1858, which are of national significance in their own right.</para><para>It was the first purpose built Federal building and was designed by the Commonwealth Architect, John Smith Murdoch, who is publicly best known as the designer of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra.</para><para>It was constructed in two stages, between 1911 and 1913.</para><para>Construction materials used in the buildings are also significant. 
</para><para>It was one of the first reinforced concrete framed buildings constructed in Melbourne. It has brick walls, finished with stucco externally and plaster internally. The original pitched roofs are clad with slate.</para><para>The building is also notable for its association with the Offices of the Prime Minister and Governor-General who have been occupants to offices in the building since 1912.</para><para>Accordingly, both because of its historic role during the early years of Federation and its location in the Treasury Precinct, it is considered by heritage authorities to be one of the most significant heritage properties listed on the Register of the National Estate.</para><para>The building has been used continuously for Ministerial and Parliamentary office accommodation since 1913.</para><para>It currently provides office and Cabinet room accommodation for Victorian based Federal Parliamentary tenants. At present there are six Ministers and a Parliamentary Secretary accommodated in the building. There is also accommodation for visiting Ministers including the Prime Minister. The current Governor-General and two former Governors-General, and some departmental staff.</para><para>The extent of the proposed refurbishment includes repair of the render work and application of new finishes, demolition of the non-original fourth-floor additions, restoration of the slate roofs, replacement of all building services and refurbishment of amenities throughout the building.</para><para>The aim of the refurbishment is to restore and protect this valuable heritage asset while providing the building tenants with an efficient and safe working environment with reduced building operational costs.</para><para>The level of disruption associated with the proposed building works necessitates the relocation of tenants to alternative accommodation for the duration of the refurbishment works.</para><para>The proposed refurbishment works are expected to take about 14 months, and the official opening of the refurbished building will form an important part of the Centenary of Federation celebrations in Melbourne early in the year 2001.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated cost of the proposed work was $15.8 million.</para><para>During the Committee's inquiry, the cost estimate was increased by $2 million. The proposed refurbishment is now estimated to cost $17.8 million.</para><para>The Committee's report recommends the refurbishment should proceed.</para><para>The Committee has concluded that: 
</para><para>.	 Whilst the building appears structurally sound, there is a need to refurbish the interior and exterior.</para><para>.	 Internally, the building's finishes and services are showing signs of disrepair and have reached the end of their economic lives.</para><para>.	 Externally, the building requires extensive restoration and the removal of extensions and roof repairs.</para><para>.	 The proposed internal and external works are extensive and can be justified to preserve the building and to provide office accommodation of a suitable standard.</para><para>Occupation of the building during the refurbishment period is impractical given the extensive nature of the works to be undertaken. Suitable temporary accommodation for existing tenants has been located at Casselden Place, at the corner of Lonsdale and Spring Streets. The cost of this accommodation is included in the project's budget.</para><para>The proposal includes refurbishment of the basement which contains the first Treasury vault. It is planned to lease the basement as a resource or interpretation centre. The Committee noted the proposed design of emergency evacuation from the basement.</para><para>The Committee has concluded and recommended that:</para><para>.	 The building certifiers have confirmed that emergency egress from the basement will be the subject of a dispensation from the Building Code of Australia. However, the Committee believes that emergency evacuation of basement occupants should be accorded the highest priority and that the suitability of the basement as a public resource or interpretation centre should be investigated further. The views of the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigades should be sought before final plans are developed for the basement.</para><para>The internal refurbishment of the buildings services and systems will be extensive. The Committee has concluded that:</para><para>.	 The scope and design of building services and systems are appropriate for the operation of the building subject to basement emergency evacuation requirements being satisfactorily addressed.</para><para>The building is listed on the Register of the National Estate,administered by the Australian Heritage Commission, which raised a number of concerns with the Committee. The Committee shares these concerns and has therefore requested that it:</para><para>.	 be provided with continuing advice and information about ongoing discussions between the Department of Finance and Administration and the Commission to ensure that all options are 
 properly explored to maintain the heritage aspects of the building.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>10067</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—The President has received letters from party leaders seeking variations to the membership of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Economics Legislation Committee—</para><para>	 Participating member: Senator Allison for the consideration of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (Administration and Compliance) Bill 1999 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999</para><para>	 Substitute members:</para><para>		 Senator Sherry to replace Senator Murphy from 22 November to 3 December 1999</para><para>		 Senator Greig to replace Senator Murray for the consideration of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (Administration and Compliance) Bill 1999 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999</para><para>Economics References Committee—</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Sherry to replace Senator Murphy from 22 November to 3 December 1999</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—</para><para>	 Participating member: Senator Murphy</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee—</para><para>	 Participating member: Senator Murphy</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Murphy to replace Senator West on 25 October 1999 for the committee's inquiry into the proposed sale of Australian Defence Industries Ltd to Transfield Thomson-CSF</para><para>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Calvert to replace Senator Ferris for the committee's inquiry into the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the importation of salmon</para><para>Treaties—Joint Standing Committee—</para><para>	 Appointed: Senator Stott Despoja</para><para>	 Discharged: Senator Bourne.

The Bill will establish the Federal Magistrates Court, also to be known as the Federal Magistrates Service, as a court under Chapter III of the Constitution. The Government is committed to providing all Australians with user-friendly, affordable options for resolving their disputes. The Federal Magistrates Service is an important step towards realising that goal. As members would be aware, the High Court of Australia was established by the Constitution in 1901. Since then, the Federal Parliament has established a number of superior courts, including the Family Court and the Federal Court, but it has never created a lower level court.</para><para>While the Commonwealth judicial structure has served Australia well, the changes that have occurred in Australian society over recent years have lead to an increased range of matters coming before the Commonwealth courts. Many of these matters are not complex and do not need to be dealt with by superior court judges. Federal and Family Court judges are increasingly tied up dealing with matters that could be dealt with more efficiently at a lower level. The need for a court which can handle less complex federal matters more efficiently and effectively is now pressing. It 
 is appropriate that, on the cusp of the new millennium, this Parliament takes the next step of establishing a new, lower level, Commonwealth court.</para><para>The Federal Magistrates Service will comprise federal magistrates, who will be justices as required under the Constitution. The Federal Magistrates will be selected for their expertise in federal matters, including family law, and will deal with a range of matters of a less complex nature that are currently dealt with by the Federal and Family Courts. The Federal Magistrates Service is intended to provide a quicker, cheaper option for litigants and to ease the workload of both the Federal Court and the Family Court. When fully established, it will free up the Federal and Family Courts to focus on the more complex matters that require the attention of a superior court judge.</para><para>The Government proposes that the federal magistrates develop a new culture, with an emphasis on user-friendly, streamlined procedures. This will be especially important for litigants who do not have legal representation. The Federal Magistrates Service will be as informal as possible, while remaining consistent with the discharge of judicial functions. This change of culture could not be achieved by appointing more judges to the existing courts. Nor would simply appointing more judges solve the problem of the waste of judicial resources which occurs as a result of superior court judges dealing with less complex maters that could be dealt with efficiently at a lower level.</para><para>The appointment of more registrars to hear more lower level matters in the Family and Federal Courts has been suggested as a solution to the delays in the courts, and has been adopted as a stop-gap measure in the Family Court. However there are significant limits on the matters which such officers of the courts can handle without running into constitutional problems. In addition, any review of a registrar's decision must involve a full re-hearing of the case before a judge. This significantly adds to the costs for parties and does not promote an efficient use of the court's time. Unlike registrars, federal magistrates will be able to make final decision in all matters within their jurisdiction and appeals against their decisions will not require a full rehearing but rather will focus on questions of law.</para><para>The Government is keen to ensure that the procedures of the new Federal Magistrates Service are as streamlined and informal as practicable. Obviously, it will be up to the Federal Magistrates Service itself to make its own Rules, which will largely determine issues of practice and procedure. However, the legislation will include provisions designed to assist the Federal Magistrates Service to develop procedures that are as simple and efficient as possible. Under the provisions of this Bill: 
</para><para>.	 the Court will have the power to set time limits for witnesses and to limit the length of both written and oral submissions;</para><para>.	 discovery and interrogatories will be permitted only if the Court considers that they are appropriate in the interests of the administration of justice;</para><para>.	 the Court can make a decision without an oral hearing with the consent of the parties;</para><para>.	 there will be more emphasis on delivering decisions orally in appropriate cases, rather than parties having to wait for reserved judgments; and</para><para>.	 there will be a power to make Rules to allow federal magistrates to give reasons in a shortened form in appropriate cases.</para><para>The Government wishes the Federal Magistrates Service to have the flexibility to tailor its practice and procedures to the particular circumstances before it.</para><para>Some Federal Magistrates will be permanently located in regional areas. In addition, Federal Magistrates will be able to travel to hear cases in centres other than those in which Federal Magistrates are permanently based, and will have the ability to sit anywhere in Australia. This need not necessarily be in a formal court room. The Federal Magistrates Service will be able to use video and audio conferencing facilities for remote witnesses and parties, and will be able to adapt its procedures to suit the parties and the individual case.</para><para>There are often cases where parties live in different towns or even different States. Use of video links will alleviate the problem of parties having to travel long distances to attend directions hearings or final hearings of their cases. This will save individuals significant time and money.</para><para>The Government is concerned that Australians from all walks of life should be able to access the court system when their circumstances require it. Measures such as these should help to facilitate this, particularly for those in regional Australia.</para><para>In addition to providing greater access to the court for regional Australians, the Federal Magistrates Service will complement the Government's initiatives aimed at encouraging people to resolve disputes through primary dispute resolution, rather than through litigation.</para><para>The Federal Magistrates Service will able to call on a range of means to resolve disputes. There will be no automatic assumption that every matter will end in a contested hearing, and the use of conciliation, counselling and mediation will be strongly encouraged in appropriate cases. Parties will be encouraged to take responsibility for resolving their dispute themselves, where this is practical. This approach  is more likely to result in a more endur 
 ing resolution of a dispute because the parties are more likely to accept agreed outcomes.</para><para>The Federal Magistrates Service will be able to use community-based counselling and mediation services as well as the existing counselling and mediation services of the Family Court, providing as wide as possible a choice for clients of the Court.</para><para>Information about a range of dispute resolution options will be available from the Federal Magistrates Service. Parties to a dispute will be able to obtain information about or referral to primary dispute resolution services even before filing an application with the Federal Magistrates Service. It is hoped that this will enable parties to avoid avoiding the need for the court to resolve the dispute. The federal magistrates will also encourage parties who have filed applications to attempt to resolve their dispute using appropriate dispute resolution processes.</para><para>The National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Committee has provided advice on use of alternative dispute resolution in the Federal Magistrates Service. Its recommendations have been taken into account in the drafting of the legislation and will be very helpful in assisting the Federal Magistrates Service to develop procedures to make optimum use of primary dispute resolution.</para><para>As I have said, the Government is concerned to ensure that all Australians have appropriate access to the court system. As well as the measures I have already mentioned, such as video links, the Federal Magistrates Service will improve access through its:</para><para>.	 user-friendly procedures and less formal judicial culture; and</para><para>.	 lower fees.</para><para>These measures should help to reduce legal costs and expenses and result in litigants saving both time and money.</para><para>As I have already indicated, the Federal Magistrates Service is intended to help ease the existing workload of the Family Court and Federal Court. It is not intended to take away federal work currently performed by State and Territory courts.  </para><para>The Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 will give the Federal Magistrates Service its jurisdiction. The jurisdiction will be concurrent with that of the Family Court and the Federal Court—there will not be any jurisdiction which is solely that of the Federal Magistrates Service. Where more complex matters are filed in the Federal Magistrates Service, there will be provisions for enabling them to be transferred to the Federal Court or the Family Court (whichever has jurisdiction). Similarly, there will be provisions 
 for transfer from the superior courts to the Federal Magistrates Service of less complex matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service.</para><para>It is intended that the Federal Magistrates Service will use the infrastructure of the existing courts to the extent practical in order to minimise costs. This may include accommodation, court rooms, some administrative staff, video conferencing equipment, library and other facilities. It is also planned that the Federal Magistrates Service will use the registry services of Family and Federal Courts whenever practical. This will ensure the most efficient use of resources.</para><para>The registrars of the existing courts are also likely to be used by the Federal Magistrates Service to perform similar functions to those they presently carry out for the Federal Court and the Family Court.</para><para>The establishment of the Federal Magistrates Service is an exciting new development, which will provide a cost effective means of helping to ease current delays and enable more effective use of expensive judicial resources. It will provide a more user-friendly option for parties to less complex matters and should also allow the Federal Court and the Family Court to concentrate on more complex cases.</para><para>It is intended that the Federal Magistrates Service place an emphasis on assisting parties to take responsibility for resolving their own disputes, when this is practicable, using alternative dispute resolution methods such as conciliation, mediation and counselling. Where this is not possible, the Federal Magistrates Service should be able to deal with matters before it with a less formal and more streamlined manner, to ensure that matters are dealt with as expeditiously and cheaply as possible.</para><para>The Government is keen to ensure that ordinary Australians are provided with suitable access the justice system according to their needs and within their means. The establishment of the new Federal Magistrates Service is an important step towards achieving that goal.</para><para>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1999</para><para>This Bill is part of a package with the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999, which will establish the Federal Magistrates Court, also to be known as the Federal Magistrates Service. The Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill provides the Federal Magistrates Service with its jurisdiction and makes other minor consequential amendments to a number of Acts. 
</para><para>As the lower level of Commonwealth court, the Federal Magistrates Service will take on a range of less complex matters which are currently heard by the Federal and Family Courts. It is not intended that the Federal Magistrates Service will take away federal work currently performed by State and Territory courts.</para><para>Its jurisdiction will be concurrent with that of the Family Court and the Federal Court—there will not be any jurisdiction which is solely that of the Federal Magistrates Service.

The <inline ref="r879">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999</inline>  places the Labor Party in somewhat of a dilemma. While we need to approve the passage of this bill for the necessary funding it will provide to the universities in the coming 12 months, we are reluctant to support at this stage any view or any action that this government is taking in relation to higher education. The government has been reluctant to put this bill on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for most of the year, and it would be even more reluctant to do so today after the events of the last fortnight.</para></talk.start><para>Let me say in my opening remarks that in the last 10 days we have witnessed an outrageous attack on the higher education sector in this country. We have seen attacks on the universities' autonomy and attacks on the relationship between staff and students about who is going to pay for higher education in this country as opposed to it being a public benefit committed to and funded by the federal government. Not only does it reveal a fundamental lack of understanding of higher education by this minister but also the events of the last fortnight have highlighted exactly what path the minister has wanted to take higher education down ever since he took over the reins from the former minister, Senator Vanstone, who did not exactly sprinkle the sector with the wonderful wealth that this country ought to invest in the higher education sector and who was relegated to a less senior position in cabinet. There are probably many people who would join with me in suggesting that that is exactly where Dr Kemp should head after his absolutely outrageous attempt to try to hide his agenda for higher education. But he was caught out.</para><para>The government are now backing away at 1,000 miles an hour but, like their policy of the `never-ever' GST, this is going to be the `never-ever' policy in respect of higher education—deregulation of fees, vouchers for use in public and private institutions, a universal loans scheme with a real interest rate and an attack on the industrial relations environment, which is still on the agenda. The government are pedalling backwards at 1,000 miles an hour in the media, in the House and in this chamber simply because they have been caught out. If we had not been given the information that was contained in the cabinet submission—a document that was developed at the request of cabinet—it would still be in the government's back pocket. The government would throw it on the table, probably hoping to implement it well before the next federal election.</para><para>Let us have a look at some of the proposals and myths surrounding what the government 
 are attempting to do. One myth that the government would lay before the community is that the deregulation of fees would have helped to meet the unmet student demand. Dr Kemp, in fact, is saying that the unmet demand will be met by lifting limits on the number of places that the universities can offer. The key is that any extra places will have to be full fee paying places. The government have not proposed to increase the number of publicly subsidised places, you would notice, in the last fortnight, except possibly as a sweetener in the short term. In fact, since the coalition were elected, demand for university places has actually fallen by 4.4 per cent in 1997 and by 4.1 per cent in 1998. The fall in demand among mature age students is around 10 per cent. The reason for the fall in demand is simply the increased cost.</para><para>The government will probably say that what they have done is throw extra money into the higher education bucket. But the reality is that you lower the threshold for HECS, and that is how that additional money has been made up—students have paid the additional money. It has certainly not come out of the public purse. They will probably say that they are increasing opportunities for students. The only opportunities will be for those who can pay. The coalition have already reduced the number of publicly subsidised places. In 1998 there were 16,500 fewer fully funded places than had been budgeted for in Labor's forward estimates. That is a figure that is obtained from the DETYA <inline font-style="italic">Higher education report for the 1999-2001 triennium</inline>.</para><para>I heard Dr Kemp say on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last week—one of the very few interviews on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> where I have actually seen Kerry O'Brien get fairly cross with the person he was interviewing—that this will not necessarily increase the cost to students. Dr Kemp acknowledges in his paper that in fact some universities will position themselves at the premium end of the market and that cost behaviour is unpredictable. As I mentioned in our censure motion of Dr Kemp last week, we already know that in the US—the system that, really, this government want us to emulate—the costs of higher education tuition have 
 soared. A commission on national investment in higher education in the United States actually recommended that increased public investment was needed to arrest the crisis occurring in higher education in that country. In Canada, students are seeking to declare themselves bankrupt on the basis of soaring student debt.</para><para>The Association of University Staff of New Zealand, hearing the news of what was happening in this country, last week issued a press release—which I have in front of me—expressing astonishment at the proposals. It says:</para><para>The Association of University Staff of New Zealand (AUSNZ) today expressed astonishment that the Australian Minister for Education was planning to introduce a funding model along the failed New Zealand lines.</para><para>So we have a look at what is happening internationally in respect of funding for higher education—we turn to the United States and to New Zealand. We look at what is happening there and cannot learn lessons from increased student debt and the lack of public confidence in their higher education systems. Oh no, we have to try to emulate them here! We have a look at what is happening overseas and disregard the facts, the figures, the opinions, the numbers of staff enrolments and graduates and try to copy what is happening, particularly in New Zealand.</para><para>The executive director of the university staff association in New Zealand said that the national government—that is, the New Zealand national government—was currently resiling from that funding model. The funding model he is talking about is, of course, the student loan debt at normal interest rates. He went on to say:</para><para>Student loan debt currently exceeds $NZ3.3 billion and, at present rates of growth, student debt will exceed the nation's public debt by around 2025.</para><para>So one would have to say that there is a situation in New Zealand that we would never want to copy and never want to have here in Australia—but not this government. This government has decided that it is probably a good thing and it is going to jump on board, except that it has had to pedal backwards very fast in the last fortnight. This government will 
 also probably say that deregulation will give universities greater autonomy. It seems from the cabinet submission that Dr Kemp wants more, not less, control over the universities. He wants to tell universities what they can and cannot do in respect of their enterprise agreements, and I will get back to that in a minute. He wants to make the universities, not the government, responsible for equity, and he will use those threats and has continued to use those threats to withhold funding.</para><para>There is the ultimate myth being put about by the government that the funding for universities is increasing. The minister claims that income available to universities is increasing, based on projections about the increasing proportion of income that comes via fees and charges. In fact, government income to universities has been steadily decreasing since 1996, as the government's own figures show. They suggest that, under the current arrangements, in the year 2000 government funding to universities will be below 50 per cent of the total operating revenue—around the same level it was in 1990.</para><para>What was even more amazing were the statements by that minister last week in the House of Representatives, prior to the release of the documentation to cabinet and prior to the Labor Party being prepared to tell the truth about what the government were intending to do in respect of higher education. Dr Kemp was asked a question about taking responsibility for universities and those that have been forced to operate at a deficit. He was in fact asked: `Do you . . . accept that there are regional campuses whose very existence is now at risk as a result of your policies?' This was a question that Michael Lee asked of Dr Kemp last Wednesday, and Dr Kemp's reply, which is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, was:</para><para>The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that.</para><para>We have actually seen in the cabinet submission an admission by this government that there are regional universities at risk, and they go so far as to say that there are eight of them. They have not identified them, but if anyone has been watching the way some 
 regional universities have been trying to cope with not meeting student demand and not meeting their targets, with the amount of funding that they have been given by this government, as little as it is, it is not too hard to work out which eight universities are working at a deficit and which regional campuses are at risk.</para><para>In another question last week, Mr Lee asked about higher staff-student ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, outdated technology, and gaps in key areas of professional preparation. He asked the minister how he reconciled those facts with his claim that the government is intending to raise the quality of university education. The answer to that question, surprisingly enough, was:</para><para>The government's policies for higher education have put the universities in a position where they have greater capacity and autonomy to manage their own affairs.</para><para>Again, if one looks at the proposed document that went before cabinet, one has to ask: why is it that this cabinet-in-confidence document says that `higher education institutions' capacity to respond flexibly and efficiently to merging student and employer demand is hamstrung' but, in answer to a question, the minister said that his policies were providing them with greater capacity and autonomy to manage their own affairs? Whom are we to believe: the public image of Dr Kemp or the private image with backdoor, in-the-pocket secret documents that are produced only for cabinet?</para><para>Probably the most outrageous and continued attack that we have seen over the last 10 days in terms of the government's obsession and absolute passion for trying to deregulate the workplace by attacking the trade union movement is their  attack on the operations of the National Tertiary Education Union and the Community and Public Sector Union. Why? Because those unions have an increasing membership from the university sector, and because they have, over the last number of years, been as effective as they possibly could in a sector that has been strangled for growth and for efficiencies.</para><para>In the cabinet document, Dr Kemp says that there are workplace rigidities in universities, 
 and he points the finger at the retention of unwieldy government structures and the persistence of an NTEU-dictated bargaining agenda. It is interesting to note that, since 1996, Dr Kemp has continually refused to meet with officials from the National Tertiary Education Union. They have not been accorded one meeting with this minister, particularly since he took over the reins from Senator Vanstone. He talks about the retention of unwieldy government structures. By that I assume he means inside the university sector, but that is just further evidence of how little he knows or understands about what is happening in the university sector.</para><para>I want to take senators through some of the impacts that government funding has had on universities and what the union and that sector have tried to do. Since 1996, enrolments have increased by 6.6 per cent, but the average staff equivalent in the general staff area has diminished by 5¼ per cent and academic staff has diminished by 3.5 per cent. So universities have in fact lost 4.55 per cent in their staffing budgets. And why have they done that? Because with a decreasing budget they have had no choice but to put staff off and to offer redundancies. They have had no choice but to offer people either casual or contract work instead of making them permanent employees in the university sector.</para><para>The staff-student ratio in the higher education sector was 14.5 to one in 1994, and in 1998 it was 17.9 to one. That is a figure you would expect in a senior secondary class of years 11 and 12. So there has been an increase of nearly four students per class in the higher education sector.</para><para>Let us have a look at salary increases. For the period 1991 to 2000, the NTEU, in consultation with their members, have been able to give their staff a 17.9 per cent wage increase. Let us have a look at that in comparison with other sectors. Engineers in this country have had a 23.4 per cent increase in wages; teachers, on average, have had a 19.8 per cent increase; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have had a 21.2 per cent increase; and the Australian Public Service have had a 19.4 per cent increase. So in a nine-year period, aca 
 demics and general staff working in universities have had the lowest increases of workers in these sectors.</para><para>We have a picture here of universities struggling with funds. They are downsizing, they are making staff redundant, they are putting staff on contract or making them casual, and they have had the smallest wage increase in nine years compared with other industries—other scientists, other academics, other engineers. And yet the minister still believes that they have an unwieldy government structure and that they are dominated by the persistence of the NTEU. Clearly his knowledge is out of date.</para><para>But wait, there is more. They will actually be allowed to get a little bit of funding—a two per cent salary supplementation—if they agree to some of the workplace reforms. Senator Carr mentioned today that this government is off getting legal advice, as it did with the wharfies and the building unions, and now it is going to start its attack on the higher education sector.</para><para>What an insult to academics and researchers in this country. It is no wonder that they are leaving the university sector in droves when all this government can do, on top of the outrageous policy it has released in the last fortnight, is to now offer them only a two per cent salary increase in relation to what has not been achieved over the last nine years. It is an insult to the higher education sector in this country and to those people who work in that sector. I think it is an absolute abrogation of the higher education sector. This federal government needs to seriously look at its policies in respect of higher education, to take that sector seriously and to fund it seriously for the public good.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>10074</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to enter this debate as one who lives and works in the rural regions of this country. The government talk about expanding funding to the higher education sector but they fail to tell the general community that the vast majority of this increased funding that they maintain has gone to this sector has resulted from changes that they made to the HECS repayments and, therefore, has been paid for by students who have 
 worked hard to get their degrees and to contribute something to this country.</para></talk.start><para>The government does not really seem to care about that particular issue. They are not concerned about what the needs of a student might be, what the needs of the tertiary sector might be and what the needs of this community might be in Australia. We have seen in recent months very strong, very rabid and radical rhetoric and hard-nosed ideology coming to the fore in terms of higher education. We have seen the VSU—the voluntary student union—legislation still hanging out there as a spectre in the mist. It is still hanging out there because there are members of the government who still are ideologically driven to see this introduced.</para><para>For ages we have argued about the impact that this would have upon education and upon the ability of student unions to provide a range of services to students and people on university campuses. The universities themselves used to provide these services but, because of the tightening of the financial screws by this government, they have had to be paid for by the student unions. We have seen that happen and we know that that spectre is out there in the mist, as I have said. I wonder when the government will reintroduce that legislation. The Senate inquiry that examined the impact of the VSUs was overwhelmed with submissions from regional universities and facilities all expressing grave concerns about the impact of the abolition of student fees upon their students, their campuses and the communities that they support.</para><para>It is not as if a university in a regional community is totally isolated from the rest of that community. It is an integral part of the community in which they reside. It is an integral part of the life of that town or city. It provides integral employment opportunities for people within that town. It provides a range of jobs from cleaning and menial labouring tasks to the employment of professors, academics and people with PhDs. And it allows people to study for PhDs. That is the value of a regional institution and a regional university. It provides communities and regions not just with a learning place for students to come to but also with an intellec 
 tual pool that enables them to supply consultants if some organisation in the community needs them. A university is able to take part and participate in the activities of the region and have an input and provide expertise in the evolution and the development of proposals, policies and issues. It is able to be involved in the identification and assessment of problems and issues that affect the region and assist in the formulation of responses.</para><para>This is what universities contribute to regional areas. They contribute far more than just turning out graduates. They are part of our community. They provide their expertise to our community. They also enable research to be undertaken in rural and regional areas. Although sandstone universities in the cities—such as Sydney University, the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Melbourne University—get the vast majority of the money, some money does come out to the institutions in the rural and regional areas. This enables very focused research to be carried out that often has more of a bent and direction towards the needs of rural people. This is often research that is rurally oriented and based and, therefore, is of great value to these communities and to Australia because it enables research to be carried out that encompasses the whole of Australia. It also enables people in rural areas to actually undertake research and their PhDs.</para><para>What does this government want of its community? Does it want all the PhD people to be actually residing on the eastern seaboard with a small pocket around the Swan River, the Torrens River in Adelaide and maybe some in Tasmania? Is that what it wants? Or does it actually want the people in regional areas to have the same resources as people in city areas? One really does have to wonder.</para><para>In the context of rural and regional institutions and the VSU, one also has to look at the services that were provided to institutions by student unions. Student unions provided things like a free legal service for students. This service was not needed because students are a bunch of rabblerousing delinquents who are always being called up before the courts because they have committed some student prank. Students, like everybody else, have 
 needs that might require some legal advice. On a number of campuses they provided dental and health services. Assistance with financial aid is provided by student unions on a number of campuses. They also provide sporting services and sporting facilities and those facilities are used very often by the whole community. It is not just the university football club or the university cricket club that might play on their grounds. It is often a resource and facility for the whole community. This needs to be remembered and not forgotten.</para><para>We have had that hard-nosed ideology in recent times. As I say, it is now, like a spectre in the mist, hidden away for the time being. But what have we seen in recent times? Last week a cabinet submission fell off the back of a truck. The contents of that submission must make anybody in any institution or anybody considering higher education shake in their boots. It certainly has shaken the universities in regional areas to their foundations. It has got everybody in rural and regional Australia absolutely furious. It is not very often in education, particularly with universities, that you actually get the academics, the administration and the students—the whole group involved in the university—plus the community in total agreement. But let me tell you that right at present out there in the bush this proposal has the community saying as one, `It is not fair, not right.'</para><para>We all know the Prime Minister has stepped in and said, `Oh, no. It won't happen.' I am sorry. Most people out there are now very sceptical of those reassurances. They heard those words when Telstra was going to be sold. They heard them when the GST was going to be introduced. Believe me—the people out there are very sceptical and that is reflected in the leader writers' columns of the regional media. The <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> editorial of Friday, 15 October, says very simply:</para><para>Will this be a kept promise?</para><para>That is a question that is on the minds of everybody out there. Will this be a kept promise? It says:</para><para>WE WILL possibly never know if federal Minister for Education, Employment and Youth 
 Affairs David Kemp was seriously floating the concept of a deregulated fee system for university students.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>. . .. we may never know because Prime Minister John Howard yesterday went on to record that Australia, under his leadership, would never introduce American-style university funding.</para><para>But it goes on a bit later on to say:</para><para>It should be remembered that while Prime Minister Howard is an honourable man, there are promises which, once given, must be kept as a matter of honour and there are political promises, which have a tendency to be subject to the winds of convenience and memory loss.</para><para>What is to say that that is not one of those promises? This government has a history of it. They did it with Telstra. They have done it with the GST. What has happened? With the GST we saw the Democrats cave in. A few minor amendments were made and off we went. We have got it, whether we like it or not.</para><para>I have grave concerns because it is unfair. What will be the impact upon education of these sorts of fees where people could be paying up to $100,000? People will say, `Oh, no. It couldn't be that much.' But we are talking market rates. We are talking compounding here. We are talking big figures.</para><para>I have an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Central Western Daily</inline> which quotes the manager of the Orange Agricultural College Student Union. That is not an institution that would be classified or considered to be a raging red institution. It is part of Sydney University but it is also an old agricultural college and has been steeped in conservatism for most of its life. But they are saying things like `it is unfair, ill conceived and elitist'. When we get organisations and bodies like that using those words, I really think that people need to take account of what they are thinking. Quoting the student union manager, the article goes on to say:</para><para>"From my perspective it will have an enormous effect on rural universities like ours,—</para><para>that is the Orange Agricultural College of Sydney University—</para><para>CSU Bathurst, CSU Riverina and the University of New England. I think if this ever came to fruition, 
 which I hope it doesn't, we would end up having a system like the United States," he said.</para><para>Mr Redden said the already powerful institutions like Sydney, NSW, Macquarie and Monash universities, which now attract the bulk of research funding and students, would become even more powerful under a pay-to-learn system that excludes poorer students.</para><para>He said the national workplace was demanding more tertiary qualifications, the government was promoting the smart country yet the Education Minister was placing financial barriers in front of potential students.</para><para>"If this proposal ever saw the light of day, I am not sure that average Australians, whose mum and dad struggled to pay the mortgage and struggled to put them through school, would ever get to university," he said.</para><para>That is one comment. There is also great concern in Dubbo, because the Charles Sturt University is looking to develop a campus at Dubbo. I would recommend to everybody an article by Professor Cliff Blake, the Vice-Chancellor of Charles Sturt University, entitled `Don't disadvantage the bush', which appears in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> . He argues very cogently the damage this measure will do. He makes this very valid point:</para><para>Children from isolated and rural families, women, Aborigines and the growing number of people who seek to re-enter education as a second chance opportunity, are all over-represented among students at the newer regional universities. 	 These are the groups least able to afford heavier debt burdens to finance their university education. They would be unable to repay loans at commercial interest rates, especially if the rate of repayment was not income contingent.</para><para>He also talks about the impact of the GST, which I mentioned a little while ago. He says:</para><para>Although tuition fees will be exempt, other costs—travel, accommodation, food and textbooks—will be subject to the tax.</para><para>Regional universities are the principal providers of distance education and are committed to flexible delivery.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Many regional universities are also required to operate on more than one campus to enhance access and to service local communities.</para><para>Because of multiple campuses, these universities are often required to duplicate some services. They do their level best not to 
 duplicate, but it is not possible to not totally duplicate. Professor Blake says further:</para><para>In a system preoccupied with economic efficiency rather than issues of access and equity, regional universities would find themselves less able to provide trained personnel in areas such as health studies, teacher education and business. They would need to reduce the number of campuses they operate, the number of courses they offer and/or the modes by which those courses are delivered.</para><para>This is going to cause them problems if they get a reduction in the number of courses and a reduction in the number of new campuses. This is going to downsize their university. It is going to run the risk of impacting upon them financially. So it is a major concern. They are concerned in Dubbo because CSU is looking to establish a campus there; it is in its nurturing stage, its very early stage. They are very concerned, because it has not properly got off the ground yet and this could well nip it in the bud. The Pro Vice-Chancellor of Charles Sturt, Dr Peter Hodgson, is quoted as saying that enrolments at the new campus could be `seriously adversely affected' if country students were unable to access HECS loans which offered minimal interest rates. He is further quoted as saying:</para><para>Charles Sturt University does not believe there is any need to reform the current HECS system which gives low-income students the opportunity to receive a tertiary education.</para><para>We do have real concerns that any changes to the system could have serious implications for the Dubbo campus and for country students.</para><para>I know several students who are undertaking distance education and are using the Dubbo campus. They find that it is a very good option for them. There is a course that enables enrolled nurses to upgrade their qualifications to become registered nurses. Being able to do it by distance education from the campus at Dubbo means that when they have to do their study blocks they do not have to leave town or they do not have so far to travel. These are the sorts of courses that lead to a better skilled work force in the regional and rural areas. Most of the women doing this course are married; they have mortgages; they have families; they have other commitments. If you told them that they had to be charged commercial interest rates to repay or to pay up-front, they would not be able to do it, they 
 would not even consider it, because the commercial interest rates would make the repayment of their fees something that was beyond their wildest expectations.</para><para>We have a shortage of registered nurses in this state, in this country. When we see this sort of thing happening, when we see these types of proposals being bandied around by the government—although we are now told they have gone into the bottom drawer, one has to wonder how long they will stay there—it is not just for the universities that we have to be concerned. It is for issues like the number of registered nurses in rural and regional areas. Because these people are upgrading their qualifications from enrolled nurses to registered nurses and because they are already established in the rural areas, with family there, they are going to stay there. They are going to become a very important pool of professional resources for us. We need to be able to offer them the full range of facilities so that they can continue to study in their own regions.</para><para>We do not want this government to have proposals that are going to affect the ability of people who live in the regions to be able to access regional universities. This government has to be condemned for even thinking along these lines. People need to be alert that that bottom drawer can easily be slipped open and that that proposal can resurface. It has happened before: it happened with Telstra, it happened with the GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>10077</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr this morning. The amendment is very telling in respect of this government's performance.

But the government does not stop there, not at all. The higher education report for the 1999-2001 triennium put out by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs provides a damning indictment 
 of this government's performance. In a way it holds the portent of what Dr Kemp recently endeavoured to implement. It is set out in the overview of the report, which states:</para></talk.start><para>Each year the minister responsible for higher education announces the details of Commonwealth funding for universities for the coming triennium in a higher education funding report.</para><para>It then goes on to say:</para><para>In the past these reports have described developments in the previous years . . . </para><para>Paraphrasing, it then goes on to say that this year's report has a `wider scope'; I emphasise that. Why? We now know why; Dr Kemp had another agenda. But when we examine the objectives that were put forward in the higher education report the government's objectives for higher education are stated to be to expand opportunity, to assure quality, to improve universities' responsiveness to varying student needs and industry requirements, to advance the knowledge base and contribution to national and global innovation and, continuing the quote from page 1:</para><para>. . . to ensure public accountability for the cost-effective use of public resources.</para><para>What have they done? They certainly have not done that. What they have done speaks volumes for what Dr Kemp has outlined. It speaks very loudly indeed for this bill. This bill sets the amounts for grants to higher education institutions for the year 2001 as well as varying the amounts for 1999 and 2000. It also takes the extraordinary step of phasing out the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. So instead of promoting, it is detracting. I would like to comment on the government's proposal in this area to scrap the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. If you go to the report that was put out in March 1999 and look at what they have to say about the equity scheme on page 65, you will see that it goes through and sets out the merit based equity scholarship scheme in 1999 and the allocation of the various institutions, of which the total sum, over the page, on 66, is in the order of $3,000. It says:</para><para>A review of the effectiveness of the scheme has recently been carried out. Options—</para><para>there is an `s'—</para><para>for the future are to be considered by the government during 1999.</para><para>That is code for: `There is only one option—close it down. Let us not look at the objectives that we set ourselves back on page 1 about expanding opportunities; let us look at the objective of closing them down.' You would have to be Nostradamus to be able to read between the lines of the March 1999 higher education report and get to the true meaning. Only with the effluxion of time do these matters get teased out by Dr Kemp, put down and brought out. Only through that process are we able to discover what he has in store for higher education. Page 1 of the higher education March 1990 book states:</para><para>. . . to provide a wider scope . . . to provide an outline of developments in higher education teaching . . . to provide the objectives . . . </para><para>This is all set out on page 1, neatly, cleanly and concisely. But none are followed. You have to go to the code and read between the lines to find out, or be Nostradamus—one or the other.</para><para>This policy they put forward—the option, rather than options—was the only positive policy they had in respect of higher education, and they have scrapped it. The proportion of students from rural, isolated and low socioeconomic status backgrounds declined between 1991 and 1997. These groups remain significantly underrepresented in higher education. It is simply incomprehensible that this government would remove the one incentive given to these people to pursue further education. In my home state of Queensland it is extremely difficult for people in rural areas to attend university without government assistance. These people have already suffered as a result of skyrocketing HECS charges and more restricted access to Austudy. With the scrapping of the scholarship scheme, it just ends up being another kick by this government to these people. Unfortunately, this backward step is not all that surprising. It is symptomatic of this government's user-pays philosophy on education, ensuring that it is only available to those who can afford to pay.</para><para>This bill also details funding for tertiary education institutions up to the year 2000, as 
 I have earlier stated, which this government proposes will remain at the same level it was 15 years ago. It would be unthinkable that any other government-provided social service of this importance would be expected to operate with the same level of funding that was received earlier last decade. If you go to the report, again you find the code which talks about it. The report talks about emerging issues on page 23. It states:</para><para>The higher education sector is adjusting to changing circumstances and its financial health is improving.</para><para>Which is code for: `There is no need for more funding; it is okay. She'll be right, mate.' That is what they are trying to say. The government obviously believe that education is of low priority, that it does not warrant any increase in funding. In fact, they believe that it deserves to lose funding increases won under the former Labor government. Labor continues to believe that not only is it the right of all Australians to access higher education but that the government has an obligation to ensure that quality education is provided through appropriate funding levels. The meagre funding proposals in this bill yet again highlight the Howard government's appalling record on higher education; one which all members of this government should be ashamed of.</para><para>Since this government came to power in 1996 the HECS charges have increased drastically, the repayment threshold has been lowered to well below average weekly earnings and funding was slashed by over $800 million. This record alone, with the alarming changes recently proposed in a leaked cabinet submission, sends a message to all Australians that this government does not care about your rights to an education unless you can afford to pay for it yourself.</para><para>At a time when the rest of the world is embracing education as the key to each nation's future, the Australian government is punishing those who want to pursue further education through imposing on them ever increasing debt and substandard learning environments. This government's record looks even worse when compared with the success of former Labor governments. Labor govern 
 ments ensured that tertiary education was within everyone's reach. Under Labor, participation in tertiary education was based on merit, not on your ability to bear a considerable debt.</para><para>Labor invested heavily in our nation's future by committing just under three per cent of GDP to investment in education, as compared to this government's paltry 2.3 per cent. This government should stand condemned for its lack of planning for the future of this country through the neglect of the education of its people. It is this government's obligation to ensure that our people, particularly young people, are equipped with the skills and knowledge to enable them to contribute to society in the future. Education is a right which should be open to every Australian. An educated population is vital to the growth and advancement of our country. This government should be judged harshly, and will be judged harshly, in years to come for its failure to realise this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10079</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions and reiterate that the government has reaffirmed its previous stance on a number of matters of higher education. Although not relevant to this bill, it is important for the record to reaffirm this once again: fees will not be deregulated, vouchers will not be introduced, HECS will not be charged for TAFE, the current HECS system will remain, there will be no additional loan system or a real interest rate attached to the current HECS system, and the current system of government subsidies and funded places will remain, as will the prohibition on charging fees for HECS liable places. That fairly and squarely meets the second reading amendments which have been proposed by both the opposition and the Australian Democrats and makes it quite clear to the community at large as to where this government stands on those issues.</para></talk.start><para>I note that some senators in this debate have mentioned the abolition of the merit based equity scholarships. The equity and access centrepiece of the current higher education system is HECS. The HECS deferred payment arrangements ensure that a 
 student is not prevented from going to university because that particular student cannot afford to pay fees up-front. It allows across-the-board access to higher education. Changes to the HECS system have been ruled out and, as Minister Kemp has said, the current HECS system will remain. I might add that no-one with an existing merit based equity scholarship will lose it. Existing scholarship holders will continue to be HECS exempt for the duration of the scholarship. The status quo in relation to HECS will continue. It is the government's priority that there be access to tertiary education by all Australian students who are willing and able to participate in that sector. The unmet demand for undergraduate places has almost been met.</para><para>The government believes that there has been an increase in enrolments in the tertiary sector since it has been in office. Minister Kemp announced a sum of money for salary supplementation for individual universities. There is funding of $250 million over three years, which will be made available on the condition that universities undertake workplace reform in the interests of students and academics alike. That spells good news for universities across Australia. I notice that the NTEU has criticised this, but one has to question its motives for doing so, because what we have here is a reform and funding for that reform which are a step forward in terms of salaries and workplace arrangements in universities across Australia.</para><para>The arrangements for universities in Australia have been that the government has allowed fee paying students domestically and this has made increased revenue available to universities. It has allowed those students who previously were unable to access courses in the tertiary sector to now do so. These are fee paying domestic students. This has increased access and also revenues to universities. The government has also announced tax reform for those areas of the private sector that want to contribute to the tertiary sector, and that has been welcomed as well. The remainder of the points that have been made can be dealt with adequately at the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja's</inline>) agreed to.</para><para>Amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr's</inline>), as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>10080</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>10080</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government request for an amendment to be moved to the bill.

I indicated in the second reading stage of this discussion that I would want to go to some questions about the review of the ESOS Act, which the government announced on 19 August this year and which I suggest should have begun a great deal earlier. It was not until such time as the opposition raised serious concerns about the operations of a number of colleges—I have indicated some 20 colleges that have not, in my judgment, been able to meet the requirements of a high quality educational service based on integrity—that there has been growing evidence of serious irregularities and, in my judgment, possible serious breaches of the law.</para></talk.start><para>Given that ACPET, which is the main organisation covering private providers in this section of the industry, have been seeking an appointment with the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs—he is well aware that I have made inquiries into this matter in question time and on previous occasions—I ask the minister whether or not the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has agreed to an appointment with ACPET. While he is finding the information, I draw to the minister's attention a statement that Mr Clive 
 Graham made to the<inline font-style="italic"> Australian</inline> on 15 September:</para><para>ACPET has lobbied hard to clean up the post-secondary vocation, education and training sector and has, on numerous occasions, presented to state, territory and federal government details of ways in which some unscrupulous operators exploit students.</para><para>The statement went on to say:</para><para>The government has ignored the industry association's warnings to the detriment of Australia's export earnings. This is surely a matter of concern to all Australians.</para><para>I understand that the minister has refused to meet Mr Graham or to consider the detailed proposal which ACPET has developed for the improvement of the operations of the industry. Our advice to Mr Graham is that he should not take this personally. I know that refusal often does offend in this business, but the truth of the matter is that Dr Kemp has made it a rule to avoid wherever possible any meeting with people involved in the portfolio area which he allegedly represents. After all, they might put to him views that conflict with his own! The trouble is that now it would appear that the overwhelming bulk of his cabinet colleagues fit into that category. One has to ask whether he finds it as difficult to meet them as he does with organisations such as ACPET.</para><para>Given that Dr Kemp is so fixated on his particular views of the way education should proceed in this country and given that these issues are of enormous importance to the success of our international education effort, I would ask: is it not possible for the minister to find time to see this organisation? If not, why not? If so, when will he do so?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>10081</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that arrangements have been made for ACPET to meet next week.

It may be that they will be happy with the meeting they have next week and they need to go no 
 further. It really is something that needs to be sorted out after the meeting next week. We will see how they go.

In the international education area, the fundamental cutting edge that we have is our reputation for quality.</para></talk.start><para>Yet the industry tell me they are not able to receive satisfaction from the department, who tell them that the complaints they are making about the operations of numerous colleges—many of which I have named—have not been able to receive a satisfactory response because, the department tell them, they are understaffed. There has been a 50 per cent cut—this is clear evidence presented to this Senate committee—to the section of the department dealing with ESOS, and the department's international division has, in fact, been downgraded despite the claims of this government as to the value of this industry to the educational system as a whole.</para><para>Minister, what assurance can you give the Senate that the complaints put by ACPET will be taken seriously? I have raised a number of matters in this chamber, and I will continue to raise a great many more. Information is coming to me on a daily basis about the operations of (1) the department, (2) the department of immigration, (3) the state governments that are involved in this arrangement and (4) the unscrupulous, unethical and quasi-criminal elements who are using this industry for the purposes of securing visas and people smuggling rather than for the 
 purpose of providing a high quality education system.</para><para>I say to the minister that these are matters I will continue to pursue, but the point remains that information is coming to me from a range of sources, and, if it is coming to me as a senator in this chamber, surely the same information has been available to the department for some time. I raise, for instance, the question of a number of advertisements that are appearing in the foreign language press circulating in this country right now and that have been circulating for some time, which the department has been advised of on numerous occasions. That is the information that has been presented to me, and I want to know if it is true. My information is that on numerous occasions advertisements have been circulating in this country which clearly are misleading and deceptive, which go to issues such as the amounts of money being transferred to certain immigration agents and education agents, who in turn are able to fix up visas and are able to attend to breaches of the ESOS Act in regard to attendance requirements. These advertisements are clearly misleading and deceptive and are breaches of the ESOS Act in themselves. I ask: is it the case that these complaints have been put to the department, and is it the case that the department has done nothing about them?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>10082</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand that the department has received some communication in relation to the points that Senator Carr has referred to, although I do not know whether they specifically relate to the ones that he is thinking of. We would need the detail in order to identify them. But I understand that there are some that have been referred to the department, and these are being looked into.</para></talk.start><para>I might just add that Senator Carr at the outset raised the point as to the government's commitment to looking into the operation of the ESOS Act. The ESOS Act deals with overseas students. This area forms quite a large part of our exports. It is no secret that education is worth in excess of $3 billion in exports for Australia. On 19 August this year Minister Kemp announced a review of the 
 ESOS Act, which had been foreshadowed last year when the sunset clause had been extended for three years. So it is not as if the government is just coming to this at the last minute or at the eleventh hour. Last year it was foreshadowed that we would be reviewing this act, and quite properly so. On 19 August this year Minister Kemp announced that review. ACPET has put in a submission, I understand, and that is being considered in the course of the review.</para><para>As well as that, on 4 November a forum of all peak bodies will be held, and those peak bodies involved in the sector will have a chance to put their views forward. That is how serious this government is. I would remind Senator Carr that just recently in the press there was the headline `Overseas students flock to Australian unis'. That article spelt out just how popular the Australian education system is with people overseas because of our very good system. Obviously that is recognised overseas. We as a government do not want to see this diminished in any way and we doing everything we can to preserve the integrity of the system.</para><para>Senator Carr has been painting a picture of a sector that is in dire straits, of something that is virtually on its knees. There are roughly 1,000 providers, I understand, in the sector. I am advised that since 1994 11 colleges have fallen into difficulty in the sector. Since 1994—five years ago—there have been 11 colleges out of 1,000 providers. That is a very small percentage indeed. In fact, you are looking at 1.1 per cent, if my arithmetic is correct. That does not necessarily portray a sector which is in dire straits. If people continue to talk down the great Australian education system that we have and play up any problems that there might be, people overseas will get a distorted view of what we have on offer, and what we have on offer is very good.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>10082</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a number of questions to the minister in relation to the phasing out of the higher education equity merit scholarships. I acknowledge that I was listening to the minister's speech in my office 
 earlier. I am curious as to the belief of the minister and the government that these are no longer required or that there is no correlation between the scheme and improvement of retention or increased participation among disadvantaged groups. In particular I look at the recipients of those scholarships and I note that the 1998 figures show a total of about 3,000 people who have been assisted. Indigenous Australians received 199, women in non-traditional areas 109, people with a disability 149, people from non-English speaking backgrounds 188, people from rural and isolated backgrounds 375 and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds 1,127.</para></talk.start><para>Does the minister honestly believe that there are no barriers to access in higher education for groups in those equity target groups? What will happen to people who are in those particular groups? What form of assistance will they receive, if any, under this government? Does the minister honestly believe that these problems will no longer exist, that when we come around to the year 2000 or 2001, as the case may be, there will not be a need among, say, students with a disability for that kind of assistance, perhaps in the form of a scholarship or at least some other form of assistance? I am quite staggered by some of the comments have come from the minister and the government suggesting that these scholarships essentially did not serve a purpose or are no longer required. I am wondering what kind of support would be provided in order to facilitate the entry to and participation in higher education of those particular groups.</para><para>I am also curious as to whether or not the minister will admit on behalf of the government that, while some increases have taken place in the number of people from equity groups, in absolute terms, the figures that are available from the department demonstrate that overall the relative representation of a number of groups has not increased; in fact, it has declined. One example is the proportion of students from rural, isolated and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. That has declined between 1991 and 1997.</para><para>These groups, as well as indigenous Australians, remain significantly underrepresented in higher education, and I refer to a <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> report that has a number of tables that illustrate this fact. So is the government not concerned that these equity groups still exist? What happens to the potentially thousands of students who could have been assisted under the scheme that is currently in operation? What methods or what assistance will the government give those students in those target equity groups to facilitate their participation in higher education, now that this merit scholarship system has been abolished?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>10083</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government did look at the merit based equity scholarship scheme and it was found to be rather complex to administer. I do return to my previous comment that HECS remains the centrepiece of equity and access in relation to Australian students accessing tertiary education.</para></talk.start><para>But I would also point out to Senator Stott Despoja the higher education equity program and the 1999 allocation, which is reported at page 64 of the higher education report for the triennium 1999-2001. That provides for equity target groups which are listed as follows: people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, people from rural and isolated backgrounds, people with disabilities, women studying in non-traditional areas and people from a non-English speaking background who have arrived in Australia within the previous 10 years. They are the target groups that are covered by this program, and there are funds which have been linked to universities' equity performance and are allocated to institutions as part of their operating grant.</para><para>The Commonwealth has played an active role in monitoring the participation and performance of the six equity groups which I mentioned in higher education, and what is set out there are the various amounts which have been allocated to the various universities and institutions. The total amount comes to just over $5.5 million. So the abolition of the merit based equity scholarships does not leave those disadvantaged groups out in the cold. There is a program which is dealing with this, 
 and can I say once again to those people who were granted the scholarships that they will continue to have them; there is no retrospective operation of this abolition of the scheme. The government believes that what it has in place will address equity in and access to the tertiary education sector and that with this program we will address those target groups of disadvantaged people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>10084</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I turn to the issue of the poor administration of international education.

Of course, he knows too well that such a figure totally misrepresents the number of colleges that have faced financial collapse in that period, because most colleges are actually taken over by another company shortly before they collapse.

Firstly, does the minister agree with Dr Kemp's assessment that `already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk'? I would like his response to that. Does he agree with that? I am wondering if he can shed some light on the time line in relation to Dr Kemp's statement in response to funding issues in higher education. The statement we are anticipating is in part a response to the West report. I am wondering when we can expect the next instalment from Dr Kemp in relation to his assessment of funding matters as 
 distinct from his cabinet-in-confidence submissions, which we have already seen.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>10085</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister has made it quite clear that he is not aware of any regional campuses being at risk of closure. I think the minister has already said that regional universities are no exception to the reality that there is always a variety of risks for complex organisations like universities, and managing these risks is always a challenge for good management. To highlight and to perhaps even distort the situation in relation to regional universities does them no good.</para></talk.start><para>Certainly, the government is keen to afford a system which provides opportunities for those students in regional Australia and regional universities. I think the minister has also said that he does not deny that some universities will need to continue to modify the way in which they operate in order to meet the challenges that are posed by operating in regional Australia. But to suggest that the actions of this government put at risk the existence of regional universities is totally false and the government would reject that.</para><para>As I have stated, the government are committed to giving greater flexibility to universities and to ensuring that the bureaucratic regulation and controls which inhibit their operations are minimised.

It is fairly simple: either you agree with his assessment or you do not.</para></talk.start><para>I also had another question. I understand that the minister was taking advice when I asked it.

 government's response to the West review and also relating to funding for higher education. I was wondering what the time line on that paper was. When can we expect that?</para><para>In relation to the scholarships, I am wondering if the government provided money to universities for the purposes of administering the scholarships and advertising those scholarships. I am conscious that one of the concerns that came back from universities during this survey, if you like, by the government was that it was difficult. Perhaps they did not advertise them broadly enough. I take on board the minister's response that it was administratively complex. I am just wondering what assistance the government provided to universities in order to ensure that those complexities were minimised so that you would have a scheme that did what it was intended to do—that is, assist those students from genuinely disadvantaged backgrounds, students who, I might add, will not have this form of assistance in future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>10086</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to Senator Stott Despoja's first question—do I agree with the minister's comments—I think she was quoting from a leaked document which I am not aware of as having any authenticity.

For instance, I cite the case of the Business Institute of Victoria which collapsed in May this year, yet no action has been taken. The last thing I would be doing is accusing this government of rushing to actually do anything to improve the operations of this industry rather than have another inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>Dr Kemp has this tremendous technique. He gets a huge mirror out. When he has a problem or he has a complaint from the Labor Party, he gets a big mirror out and has a good look into it. That is all that ever happens. What you identify is a constant failure by this government to deal with fundamental questions which go to the heart of the success of education in this country—that is, provision of quality services. We have been seeing a decline in a range of areas. The minister acknowledges it himself these days. His 
 cabinet submission said, `There is a perception of a decline in quality in higher education.' But we notice that it is not just in the universities. There is a decline in quality in a range of other educational institutions, yet there is no action being taken by this government other than to get the big mirror out and have a look into it.</para><para>Of course, when you find out what the scam really is—that is, what the government's proposals really are in terms of their cabinet submission—we hear repeated denials: `Oh, we didn't really intend to do that at all. We didn't really want to get into that area at all.' We hear from the government: `That's not our intention—to introduce an American style education system. We are not going to introduce a series of measures which would undermine the quality of education still further.' What we hear from this government is: `Well, we'll put that on the back burner. We'll have a look at that later on.' That is a pattern that is now emerging.</para><para>I ask the government: given that there are substantive powers currently available for this government to get off its tail and actually do something rather than get the mirror out, why isn't the government moving? What is stopping the government from moving? Of course, it will be said that it is natural justice. Well, there is no natural justice for the people that are ripped off by these unethical operators. There is no natural justice for those that are brought into this country as students and told that they are going to be given a quality education but find themselves forced into the clutches of some of these unsavoury characters. There is no natural justice for those that are used as cheap labour in the restaurants, the hotels, the cleaning businesses or the brothels in this country. There is no natural justice for them because they are here on the basis that if they do not do what they are told they will be shipped out. They are told, `Carry a toothbrush with you, because at any time you could be tapped on the shoulder and taken out.' There is no basis of complaint for them. There is no natural justice for them. There is only the opportunity to be given short shrift if you complain. There is therefore a continuing cycle of corruption—corruption 
 in the sense that people act on the basis of monetary gain rather than the provision of the services which we would expect of them.</para><para>What has this got to do with education? It has everything to do with the quality of education. The provision of educational services in this country has to be predicated on the assumption that everyone is entitled to a high quality service. Increasingly evidence is showing that if we get a reputation internationally for not being able to provide a high quality service for everybody and we get a reputation for being used as the vehicle for various people smugglers then we will find that there will be a decline in our international reputation. That all comes back to the government. It comes back to the officers in this chamber at the moment because it is their responsibility as the gatekeepers on behalf of this parliament to ensure that we are providing a quality service. If they cannot do their job, we are entitled to ask: why not?</para><para>They say to people in the industry, `We do not have enough resources.' I say that is because the government has cut these officers back. There is 50 per cent less of them. I also say that the government does not have the political will to do anything about it. This government works on the assumption that the private market—the free-for-all—should rule. That means that the lowest common denominator should rule. Cost pressures are leading to a decline in the number of students in many sectors, not just the universities but in so many other sectors of the international education industry. This bill goes to all of those, not just the higher education system. Cost pressures mean that providers are often placed in a position where they have to cut corners.</para><para>And when you have to compete against some of these characters that are offering courses for about $1,000 a year when the quality programs are running at $12,000 a year, you are entitled to ask: how do they do it? They do it on the basis that they are not actually teaching. They are not in the business of providing a service; they are in the business of providing a visa. That visa is then used to provide the sweatshops of this country with cheap labour. They are using vehicles 
 such as the ESOS Act which is being subverted because this government is not doing enough to stop it. The providers who are engaged in this with crook immigration agents and crook education agents know what the scam is and know that they will not meet any real resistance from this government. That is a very serious question which goes to the very heart of the provision of education in this country and to the very heart of the nature of the matters being discussed before us at the moment. I ask again, minister: why are you not taking action, using the existing powers, to clean up the corrupt practices in this industry?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>10093</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can only reiterate that the department is looking into these matters, and that it would be unwise to comment on operational matters.

I bet that if it had Dr David Kemp would have issued an all points bulletin. We would have had an alert telling us exactly what bits were fraudulent or incorrect or inappropriate in some way. </para><para>Quite the contrary: we have heard Dr Kemp in a number of instances, in particular in an interview with Kerry O'Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>—I thank the minister for granting leave to table that document—expressly acknowledging quotes from that document, not resiling from them, not suggesting that he is not responsible. He does not resile or recoil from them in any way. He counters them on some occasions with perhaps different arguments or interpretations. But I did not read one sentence that said, `This is not my document, I did not write this.' Quite the contrary: a number of his statements began, `I was not saying this there' or `I said this' or `We meant in the document that'. Excuse my paraphrasing. He does not resile from the ownership of that document.</para><para>I thank the minister for his concerns. I am a little upset by his lack of goodwill. I think there is a good argument to table a document when there have been a number of quotations from that document, and the government can put on record its concerns about that document being tabled. No-one is pretending that it is the original. When you table a document that says, `This document has been retyped from the original', you are not exactly pretending. It is an interesting argument that the minister has put forward but a little churlish. I suspect that David Kemp might have a slightly different attitude. I take the minister at his word when he says that he had not seen it until today, although the rest of us involved in education debates had seen it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>10094</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stress once again that what we are relying on here, with the retyping or reconstruction of this document, is that a third party has been involved in that.

However, I do require—and I will be pursuing the departmental officers on this issue at the estimates hearings on 1 December—that there be a robust inquiry into the operations of those colleges to date.

I have raised concerns about a range of institutions, that is, those operating in this new twilight zone of the Internet. I have mentioned the Australasian Institute. I have raised the issue of the University of Asia and St Clements. I have been concerned at the failure of this government to take a whole-of-government approach to the question of these universities operating outside of the HEFA Act, with the exception, presumably now, of Greenwich. They claim to be Australian universities, and operate in the international market as Australian universities, to which the government seems to have a range of responses according to whether it is the taxation department, the securities commission, the department of education, the department of territories or the department of immigration.

You have the Department of the Treasury saying: `It is okay if you want to operate in this field. Anyone can call themselves a university.' I have a company around the corner from my electoral office known as University Meats.

I remind the government and senators generally that this debate spanned six days. It was lengthy and detailed, and there is no doubt that a lot of attention was given to the important issues by the Senate at that time. Further, this is a matter that has been widely canvassed for quite some time. We are therefore very disappointed at the way in which Minister Tucker flippantly treats the very considered amendments carried by this chamber. His response publicly after the Senate carried the legislation with those amendments was, in his usual bullying fashion, to try and stand up the Senate and the parliament and say that he would consider withdrawing the legislation. His attitude was that these amendments would not be given any serious con 
 sideration at all by him or the government. His message to the Senate was, `You had better pass my bill, or else.' That is reflective of his attitude all the way through the development of this legislation.</para><para>When he came to deal with the bill last week in the other place, he demonstrated his hypocritical and inconsistent approach; and he demonstrated that his approach is a political one, not one that is based on a balanced approach and a balanced assessment looking for a balanced outcome in a very difficult issue. For instance, he rejected our perfectly reasonable objects clause, yet in his opening remarks in the debate in the other place last week he stated:</para><para>The Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 provides legislative support to the outcomes being achieved under the regional forest agreement process. The government is working cooperatively with the states to implement the National Forest Policy Statement, which is the framework for a long-term and lasting resolution of forest industry, conservation and community interests and expectations concerning our nation's forests.</para><para>So at the very outset he acknowledges the importance of the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement, but he point blank refuses to even include in the bill an objects clause that will reflect the principles of that statement.</para><para>Subsequently, however, in his own amendment establishing the Forest Products Industry Council, in what is clearly a political move designed to win over some support from the union movement for his proposals, he has agreed to include recognition of the wood and paper industry strategy. It is rather ironic, because the wood and paper industry strategy was one developed by the previous Labor government as a consequence of the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement. That was a strategy that was abandoned by this government when it came to office, but now this minister, in a rather cynical way, is prepared to give recognition to that in his half-baked proposal for a Forest Products Advisory Council. It is clearly inconsistent. Why on the one hand object to a perfectly reasonable, sensible and necessary objects clause but on the other hand in another amendment give some recognition to it? I will 
 come back to the Forest Products Industry Council and our proposal for the Wood and Paper Industry Council a little later.</para><para>The minister has also gone around the country in his usual fashion attacking the Labor Party and attacking the Senate, claiming that we are frustrating the process. He is now claiming that somehow, as a result of this legislation not being passed, all RFAs will not be completed by 31 December this year. The delays are due entirely to this minister. If one has followed his performance over past months, one can see him chop and change from day to day or week to week. One day he is attacking the industry and the New South Wales government for their agreement on the north coast forests, trying to play the role of an environmentalist. The next day he is attacking the Western Australian government. There is absolutely no consistency in his approach, and that has been demonstrated by his reaction to the amendments put forward by the Senate.</para><para>I turn quickly to one other issue. No doubt I will need to make some further remarks on it later in this committee consideration. The minister has claimed, in his reasons for rejecting our proposal for disallowance procedures, that they are unconstitutional. It is quite clear that his arguments just give support to the old maxim that you can get whatever legal advice you want if you frame the question accordingly. In what has to be one of the greatest jokes of all time from this minister, he says that we do not need a disallowance process or a parliamentary scrutiny process. I quote from his reasons:</para><para>Further, if there is a concern that RFA requirements are not being complied with, it is open to parliament to amend or repeal the bill.</para><para>This is a bill that, when enacted, is supposed to give certainty to this industry. Yet this minister says he will not accept parliamentary scrutiny at the outset of the process but that, if there is a problem somewhere over the next 20 years, the parliament can come back and amend the legislation. That is a nonsensical proposition and a dangerous proposition for this industry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10099</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens will not be voting for the House

In particular, the legislation provides that, where the forests—or the wildlife in them—are to be protected by federal decree in those 20 years, the woodchip corporations are to be compensated by Australian taxpayers for the value of those forests for which the woodchip corporations have never paid a red cent—nothing at all. What has astounded me about this whole process is that those very woodchip corporations have cried crocodile tears over jobs in the forests right down the line and yet there is no provision in the legislation and no move by the House of Representatives—that is, the government—in this process to provide for compensation for workers who lose their jobs, not even for the reskilling of them.</para></talk.start><para>This is a heist of the Australian people's forests for a small number of rich corporations to maraud the unprotected forests of this nation, largely to send those forests as woodchips to Japan, Korea, China and other destinations in the Northern Hemisphere where they are converted into paper and enter the disposal cycle. The grandest forests of this country end up in the landfills of the Northern Hemisphere, and where the forests are destroyed the wildlife is destroyed with them.</para><para>As I have explained to the Senate in the previous full debate on this matter, the cycle in Tasmania is to cut down the grand forests, firebomb to prevent any regrowth of rainforest or competing species, and then poison the area with 1080 to kill any wildlife coming into the area. And this legislation is to compensate that process, augment it, foster it and extend it. As you will remember, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, during this debate when I asked the government representative about—and challenged that representative 
 over—so-called ecologically sustainable logging that this legislation is supposed to foster, she sat glued to her seat because there is no defence of the doublespeak.</para><para>Ecologically sustainable logging, according to Prime Minister Howard's pacts with several premiers, means total destruction of the forests and their replacement with genetically modified, fast growing eucalypts or pines for the further enhancement of the woodchip corporations' interests further down the line. All this is totally unnecessary because, as you know, there are enough plantations in this country to provide all its wood needs.</para><para>Even when it comes to the balance of payments, the myth that is put about by people—including the government spokesperson on forests and so-called conservation, Mr Tuckey—is that we are somehow imbalanced in a way which requires us to continue the destruction of our native forests. In fact, we export twice as much wood as we import. The problem is that the industry, because it is rapacious and greedy, does not downstream process in this country or create the jobs here. It allows that to happen elsewhere and we import goods based on wood at twice the cost that we export our wood. So we end up basically with this terrible process where we export much more than we bring into the country, but we pay more for what we bring into the country than what we export. There is nothing in this legislation or in the amendments coming back from the House of Representatives that is going to meet that problem and get Australia the advantage that it could have through downstream processing of its plantations, protection of its native forests and a commitment by the industry, as well as government, to look after the jobs of those in the forests.</para><para>The regional forest agreement signed in Tasmania is a fraud. It is a fraud that has been perpetrated on the workers in the industry. Those Tasmanian senators who are present will have read the weekend press in Tasmania which highlighted a group of transport operators committed to the logging industry. They talked about how they had come to this parliament to protest against conservationists and in favour of the wood 
 chipping industry but in the last few weeks, in the wake of the regional forest agreement whereby Prime Minister Howard and others indicated that they were acting in the `interests of the workers', they have been dumped. They have huge repayments on their machinery and they have no way of paying them. Some of those men and their families are going to end up in bankruptcy.</para><para>Where is the logging industry? Where is the government? Where is the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania, which supports this fraudulent process? Where is the Prime Minister to succour these people who have now been put on the garbage tip and have been thrown out of work, along with nearly 500 others who have suffered a similar fate, since the woodchip organisations managed to get the Prime Minister's and the Premier's signatures on the bottom of a regional forest agreement? Then we are asked in this Senate to endorse that process.</para><para>The sad thing about this is that even the Labor Party's amendments left Tasmania out in the cold. There is no review process in these proposals either from the House of Representatives or from the Senate to enable the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement to be vetted by the Senate. We are supposed to accept, as a parliament, a mechanism whereby the Prime Minister and the state Premier have signed an agreement to hand across the forests to the sectional interests of the big corporations who are not based in Tasmania—neither their headquarters nor their shareholders are—but at the same time to underwrite them should there be any future federal move on behalf of the nation or Tasmanians in particular to protect our forests. The whole process is shameful. It is disgusting.</para><para>Nevertheless, I am hopeful that these minimalist amendments which the Senate agreed to will be insisted upon. How dare the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who has conserved nothing since he entered that portfolio, rail against the Senate for these minimalist amendments which, amongst other things, would see the regional forest agreements on the mainland, with the exception of the early agreements signed in East Gippsland and in Victoria, brought before the parlia 
 ment. The taxpayers are underwriting them; should not the parliament be vetting them? Of course it should. As a Green I will be supporting these amendments for the little improvement that they do make to what is a parlous sell-out of the nation's interest, which the regional forest agreement process and this legislation represent.</para><para>I have to foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to the amendment brought up here from the House of Representatives so that if there is—and this is another gift to the industry—a forest products, taxpayer funded council set up, it is not just those who wield chainsaws that are on the council but also representatives from the forest related tourism industry, because that is where the job creation in forests is in Tasmania. There are more people getting jobs out of the preservation of our forests, intact, in Tasmania—more than 3,000 these days—than are involved in the destruction of native forests.</para><para>I will also be moving an amendment to say that there should be represented on such an industry council people who are interested in forest related water industries, because there has been a lot of contention not only in this country but also right around the world about the damage to water catchments that accrues from logging—and not just through the pollution of streams by direct run-off and by soiling of streams. I remember an indigenous person in Sarawak describing their river, which used to be pristine and full of fish but now was neither, as looking like a river of Milo—referring to the Nestle product—because that is just what their river looked like. Rivers in Australia downstream of logging operations look much the same.</para><para>Of course, there is the added hazard after the logging industry has moved in of the spraying of pesticides and, on occasions, herbicides into the fast growing plantations. These are particularly vulnerable, genetically modified plantations which replace these forests very often in the headwaters of rivers which are used for a variety of other purposes, including drinking water for people living downstream. Water is an industry these days and that very important commercial as 
 well as environmental entity should be represented on any such council.</para><para>Earlier I supported the proposal put forward by the Labor Party as an alternative, which I think is superior, and I would make a minor amendment to ensure that a representative of the Australian Conservation Foundation is on the council that is proposed there. I support the Senate's stand on this matter. I hope that the Senate will remain resolute. I take the opportunity again to condemn the legislation while adding support to these very minor, around the edges amendments which the Senate has made and put to the House of Representatives and which the House of Representatives is, in the interests of the woodchip corporations, trying to eliminate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>10102</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The reasons why the government does not support these amendments and in particular the amendments which tie regional forest agreements to a new objects clause, thus enabling disallowance by either house, have already been explained to the Senate in the previous debate and I do not propose to go over those matters again. I would, however, like to take a few moments to explain to the opposition the practical consequences of their disallowance proposal. This amendment would require that proposed RFAs be tabled in each house, and each house then has 15 sitting days to disallow. This is to be preceded by certain procedural requirements, including publication of the proposed RFA in the gazette, and it includes the RFAs signed in Western Australia, north-east Victoria and Eden.</para></talk.start><para>It is highly probable that there would be an attempt to disallow all these RFAs in the Senate, and the opposition itself has implied that it will seek to disallow the Western Australian RFA. Given that the remaining uncompleted RFAs are not likely to be signed before mid-December at the earliest, the consequence of the opposition's amendments would be the immediate cessation of woodchip processing in all areas except those where RFAs were signed before 1 March 1999, because the exporters would have no guarantee that their product could be shipped. 
 The parliamentary sitting schedule means that this would be the case even if the government were to move to extend the existing licences for a short period and regardless of whether or not the RFAs were eventually disallowed by the Senate. The mere fact that Senate approval was required would prevent a woodchip exporter from processing residues.</para><para>For those RFAs disallowed by the Senate there would be no certainty of a final resolution at all, given the need to negotiate sequentially with the states and the Senate. No doubt the Greens and the Democrats would be very pleased with this outcome, but it would cause massive disruption to the native hardwood timber industry in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and possibly even Tasmania. Timber mills would either close or lay off workers, and contractors would be unemployed. These impacts would hit hardest in small mills where sales of residue play a larger part in cash flow. There are no circumstances under which the government would allow this to happen and therefore it cannot support the amendments. I am surprised, Senator Murphy, that you are supporting these amendments, given your usual stand on the rights of the workers and the way in which you want to support industries in Tasmania, because your state will be hit hardest by these.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MURPHY</name><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name></talker><para>—You will hear from me in due course.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name></talker><para>—There would also need to be a freeze on industry development and restructuring assistance negotiated as part of RFAs, further penalising industry and stifling investment prospects. Industry has pushed the need for RFA-led certainty legislation, and it has strongly expressed the view that it would be more secure without the bill rather than have an amended bill as proposed which would deliver additional uncertainty. Therefore, the only thing that these amendments are achieving is delaying the bill until after all the RFAs are signed and preventing the government from getting on with the job of restructuring the industry under secure RFA regimes. After all the RFAs are signed, the effect of the amendments would be to prevent almost all woodchip exports for a period ranging 
 from some months to indefinitely—a position which I am assuming the opposition will not promote.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As we all know, the government has previously tabled advice from the Office of General Counsel that the parliamentary scrutiny provisions proposed by the opposition are unconstitutional. I note that the shadow minister for justice argued against this view in the other place and raised some interesting legal issues. However, at the end of the day, an argument about whose legal advice is better will not matter one whit.</para><para>The real vote on this bill will be taken by those people who are contemplating major investment in this industry which, I remind the Senate, currently runs an annual trade deficit of almost $2 billion. Those people are telling us that they will not invest without the security provided by this bill as originally put forward by the government. So the choice is now with the opposition.</para><para>Senator Forshaw, you mentioned that you were disappointed. I am also disappointed with the attitude of the opposition. You can either support the government in not insisting on these amendments or you can again support the amendments which I have clearly explained to you would cause unemployment among the very people whom you claim to represent. You would also cause massive disruption to an industry which you purport to support.

These reports come out of Treasury. They used to come out of the Attorney-General's Department but, in recent years, corporations have been regulated through the Treasury because the government wants to give emphasis to the function of companies involved in producing goods and services so that the country can become more wealthy, and that is a good thing. But companies are not simply about that. There are other aspects of them that should be looked at. These two reports are interesting in their contrasts. The first is a report from the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. That is a committee dedicated to enabling company law to be so arranged as to give companies the ability to flourish as they should. They have much to do with matters like CLERP.</para><para>The other report is from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It also deals with the sorts of things that the first report deals with. In addition, it points out the other issues that are very much alive in the corporate world. On page 33 of the report, the Chairman, Mr Alan Cameron, notes that, during the period that this report covers, `$6.5 million was recovered for miners who worked at Cobar. An amount of 87 cents in the dollar was recovered for those people.' Unfortunately, there is no mention here of other areas where workers have been left without their due reward—areas like Mount Schank, Wodonga and others which have now become famous.</para><para>What this report does is to indicate that companies now affect the lives of all of us—not only our working lives but also the lives that we may lead in terms of leisure. Companies affect the environment. There is now a provision in the Corporations Law requiring companies to give an account of how they 
 have looked to the care of the environment during the course of a particular reporting period. That is important to understand: companies are now so fundamental to the sorts of lives that we all live that it is time this parliament became more and more conscious of that fact and made laws that require companies not only to produce the income and wealth they do but also to act in a way that is consistent with the sort of life that we all want to lead. We have dealt with the way that powerful interests have acted in the past, and it is now time for us to look at companies—not only multinational companies but companies generally—to see them for what they are and to make our laws so that not only the economy is looked to but also every other aspect of our lives.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Lightfoot)</name></talker><para>—I put the question that the documents be accepted.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I seek your advice, Mr Acting Deputy President, as to whether this is the right juncture for me to comment on document No. 13 on this list?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I am advised that we need to put the question with respect to Senator Cooney's documents first, Senator Brown.

The act covers all private sector organisations, higher education institutions, group training schemes, unions, community organisations and non-government schools with more than 100 employees.</para><para>The objective of the Affirmative Action Agency is to achieve equal employment status for women and to assist in the elimination of employment discrimination. I would like to draw to the Senate's attention what I believe to be one of the agency's most important roles: monitoring the actual progress of businesses in implementing affirmative action programs. It is good to know that businesses and other groups around Australia are starting 
 to realise that it makes sense to treat women as equals and to promote programs that help women realise their full potential.</para><para>The agency acknowledges that reports made to it by various groups show incremental improvements to various practices. Nearly 300 organisations have been identified as best practice. There are, unfortunately, 55 organisations that have not met their reporting requirements under the act. I am not going to single out organisations that are identified as best practice, nor am I going to single out the ones that are non-compliant. I do want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the best represented private sector companies in the annual report's list of best practice groups are machinery and equipment manufacturing companies and metal ore mining companies. Universities and a number of community groups are also listed. I congratulate the organisations in those areas, especially the equipment manufacturing and mining industries, that have made those achievements in a particularly difficult trading environment.</para><para>There are a lot of statistics in the annual report, but let me focus on one particular area that the agency looked at: recognising that women are more likely to be the primary caregiver to children is extremely important. Overall, 66 per cent of organisations look at workplace agreements and awards for their possible impact on women's conditions of employment. Private sector companies are becomingly increasingly aware of the need for this, with 71 per cent saying they looked at this in 1998. This was up from 65 per cent in 1997 and just 48 per cent in 1994.</para><para>The agency reports that `part-time work with pro-rata conditions continues to be an increasing feature of employment practice across all sectors, with almost 86 per cent of all organisations utilising part-time employment'. Unfortunately, the provision of paid maternity leave is widely disparate across the different sectors. The private sector, despite increases of one or two per cent in each of the last four years, still has maternity leave provision rates of less than 17 per cent—less than one in five. Thankfully, the percentage of schools, higher education institutions and 
 community groups providing this condition is much higher.</para><para>All of the sectors examined are increasingly implementing job-sharing. A total of 67 per cent of private sector companies are providing job sharing opportunities. That is up 23 per cent since 1994. All of these initiatives give women a better chance of pursuing a career and starting a family.</para><para>Let me finish by congratulating the staff of the Affirmative Action Agency for all they have achieved in promoting the role of women in the work force.

I am waiting expectantly for their final report next year.</para><para>Page 6 of the annual report contains a summary of the Employment Advocate's functions. They include providing assistance and advice to employers, especially in small business; advice to employees under the Workplace Relations Act 1996; and a number of other matters. It goes on to state that, in performing these functions, it will also:</para><para>pay special regard to the needs of workers in a disadvantaged bargaining position (for example, women, people from a non-English speaking background, young people, apprentices, trainees and outworkers).</para><para>The second area is `assisting workers to balance work and family responsibilities'.</para><para>Unfortunately, one's ability to make an assessment of the financial reporting regime of the Office of the Employment Advocate is a little hampered. At page 7, which covers the Employment Advocate's staff, we are told that the budget for the Employment Advocate will appear in the DEWRSB budget appropriation—which I understand is not yet tabled. But some insight is provided into the types of things that the Employment Advocate spends its money on. The report certainly does not provide any great detail on the matters I 
 referred to earlier, but it does say that something in the order of $315,268 or 7.8 per cent of salaries is spent on training themselves. If you then multiply that—my figures might be a bit wrong—the salary is $4 million odd.</para><para>It is interesting to look at the advertising the Office of the Employment Advocate has undertaken. Some $2.9 million was spent on campaign advertising. This involved the placement of advertisements in the media, the production of print and television advertisements and so on. It excludes its non-campaign matters, which total some $14,000 for the cost of newspaper advertisements. So the cost of the advertisements of this organisation are, in short, extraordinary. It then talks about matters that it does not really give figures on. It talks about market research by Brian Sweeney and Associates, who undertook some concept testing of advertisements suggested for their campaign. It does not give any figures on this. It talks about the Wallis research group, and does not provide any figures for this.</para><para>It then talks about 50-odd consultancies on which about $1.3 million was spent. The figures for advertisements, consultancies, market research and money it spent training its officers certainly mount up. Reference is made on page 22 to what it actually spent on delivering the services that I spoke about earlier. We are told that the budget for extending the pilot with the direct client services providers into the second half of 1998-99 was some $167,000.</para><para>From looking at the reporting for the second half of 1998-99, you can gain a slight appreciation that they spent $167,000 on delivering some of those services that they should be delivering. However, their advertising budget is nothing short of extraordinary. The results of that are even more extraordinary. During 1998-99 it approved some 39,874 AWAs—a pitiful amount. If you divide that by the $2.9 million for advertising, you are left with about $72 per head.</para><para>You then go to the cost of complaints. There were 785 complaints for the year—an extraordinarily low amount.

This report is very sparse on the sort of information that would enable parliament to assess just how successful the Office of the Employment Advocate is and exactly what work it does. For example, on page 8, under the heading `Delivering quality management', the report states:</para></talk.start><para>The OEA has continued to outsource its internal audit function to KPMG. KPMG oversee a program of quarterly internal audit reviews.</para><para>There is no detail of that audit, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson. Somebody with the vast experience you have in this area would understand what an adequate audit is and what detail might be expected so that members of parliament and, indeed, anybody reading the report can understand just what the audit consists of and how effective it has been. On page 9, under the heading of `Fraud control', the report says:</para><para>The Employment Advocate has taken further steps to guarantee that fraud control remains a priority within the OEA. As part of this plan, the OEA—</para><para>the Office of Employment Advocate—</para><para>implemented a fraud control policy as a development from the existing fraud control plan.</para><para>It would have been useful for people reading this report to know why the Office of Employment Advocate should be so concerned about fraud within the Office of Employment Advocate and why it is giving priority to guarantee that fraud control remains in the forefront of its concerns. When the Employment Advocate comes to prepare the annual report for 1999-2000, perhaps he might give consideration to those issues.</para><para>It is difficult to understand what it is that the Employment Advocate does when he deals with cases. Pages 18, 19 and 20 illustrate what I mean. The Employment Advocate mentions an action he has against a Victorian employer. The number given is VG389 of 1998. It simply says:</para><para>A part XA matter re an employer in the leisure industry failing to re-engage casual employee who did not sign an AWA and complained to the OEA. The matter was settled on payment of compensation to the employee and undertakings from the employer.</para><para>From that you can get no concept of how the Employment Advocate went about his job, how effective he was, how adequate the compensation was and how effective the undertaking from the employer was going to be.</para><para>A series of other legal matters are referred to, mainly against unions. They are named. The employer is not named. The union is named and in each case an assessment is given of how the case is going. There seem to be a lot more actions against unions than against employers. It would be useful to know why that is the case and how the Employment Advocate is going about his job. This report raises a lot of questions but answers very few of them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>10107</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>10107</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were considered:</para><para>Commonwealth and Defence Ombudsman—Report for 1998-99, including a report pursuant to the <inline font-style="italic">Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981</inline> .

We had previously discussed a number of specific regions and difficulties faced by smaller centres in rural and regional Australia—centres on the New England of New South Wales, in western Victoria and in the Hunter Valley. The key theme of the speeches was that the role of government had to shift from being a doer and a director to being a change leader in line with the 1994 McKinsey report. Last week I focused on some of the influences of worldwide economic forces as they are impacting on specific industries and which in turn impact on various regions. I spoke last week about the BHP shut down of the investment in most of its steel operations. I expressed my disappointment at that time that BHP was not prepared to stay in a comprehensive steel industry and that the vision of the founders of BHP, in particular Delprat and Lewis, had been lost in the passage of time.</para></talk.start><para>I rise today on a matter of great public interest in another industry—that is, the revolution that is currently sweeping across the banking industry. Last Wednesday, Westpac announced its plan to axe a further 3,000 jobs across Australia. Since 1991, Westpac has axed some 10,000 in total and 
 this further cut will reduce its staff by another 10 per cent. It will also close another 300 branches. According to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 14 October this year, the latest axings from Westpac include 700 jobs in rural and regional New South Wales, 800 in Queensland, 300 in Victoria and 295 in back office jobs in a number of states. According to the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 14 October, Westpac will close down 200 rural branches. Of these, Westpac anticipates that some will be converted to in-store operations with the hope that staff that are shed might get a job there. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> on 14 October, Westpac wants to achieve a national savings of $300 million.</para><para>The effect of this in my own region will be that branches with five staff or less will go in this national restructuring. The future of branches in this area—including Belmont, Cardiff, Cessnock, Charlestown, Maitland, East Maitland, Hamilton, Kurri Kurri, Morisset, Newcastle, New Lambton, Raymond Terrace, Swansea, The Junction, Toronto, Wallsend and Warners Bay—is unclear. Not surprisingly, the Hunter Region Organisation of Councils has been scathing of the Westpac restructuring. The Hon. Milton Morris, former minister from 1965 to 1975 in New South Wales, had this to say:</para><para>This is an absolute kick in the teeth to country regions particularly. The rapacious attitude and the greed of the banks knows no bounds.</para><para>The Managing Director of Westpac, Mr David Morgan, says that there is still too much excess capacity in his organisation. What a change of attitude! If we go back 20 years, I remember one particular banking company screening TV ads of a man fighting his way through the bush and pushing branches out of the way, the ad carrying a caption that a certain bank had branches everywhere. That is what they were pushing at that time. This was seen as a great thing. Of course, that is no longer true.</para><para>I gained some insight into why the banks have changed their minds when I had a senior executive from one of the big four banks come to see me. He went through the way in which they decided to close their branches. It is a very simple method: they list them in 
 order of profitability—most profitable through to least profitable—and then close the least profitable. You do not have to be an expert to work out where the least profitable are; they are usually in regional and rural Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—But they are still profitable.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—They are still profitable, that is true, but they have a lower profitability, so they are shut. If the banks are making money, in my mind, there is no reason why such branches should not remain open. The combined profits of the big four banks was $9.2 billion last year. Isn't that enough? Have the banks really lost their way on the balance between the interests of their stakeholders? Let me remind the Senate who their stakeholders are. Sure, it is the shareholders; but it is also the customers, the staff and the community. The banks are now totally focused on shareholders, with very little interest in the customers, the staff or the community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Recently, in the launch of his book, <inline font-style="italic">Managing in Australia</inline>, the former Telstra CEO, Frank Blount, commented very astutely:</para><para>The role of CEO is to optimise long-term shareholder value.</para><para>It does not mean that you block out everything else like your social responsibility in communities where you work, play and invest.</para><para>You've got to balance all 4 stakeholders—community; staff; customers and shareholders.</para><para>That was said by a person who was a leader of one of the biggest organisations in Australia up until recently. In the bid to make more profit, the banks are forgetting that they are a necessary service that should be available to all Australians, including people living in rural and regional areas. The Australian public have become understandably cynical about the commitment of the banks to their area. How much profit is enough and when will banks really start giving back to the community? What they are doing instead is actually taking from the community, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>If you look at the pattern of the close down of branches, you see that in 1994 there were 6,747 bank branches in Australia, whereas in 1998 there were 5,615. Therefore, more than 
 1,132 branches have shut down. Since 1993, out in the rural and regional areas, there has been a 20.5 per cent reduction in the number of country branches by the big four banks. Even more shutdowns are on the horizon. Is the solution for the banks just closure and axing jobs?</para><para>There are some hopeful signs that the banks are starting to respond to community outrage. After I visited Tenterfield about a year ago I issued a press release welcoming ANZ's decision not to close any more rural branches in the next 12 months. Westpac announced on 13 October this year that by the year 2000, 200 traditional branches will be converted to in-store operations. That shows some sign of improvement, rather that the banks taking the attitude that they are just going to leave town. As I said before, 300 branches have been closed and 200 transaction centres are being opened. But they have scaled down their operations and lost a total of 100 branches.</para><para>Colonial State Bank was the leader in the establishment of in-store branches, and they should be congratulated on that. When I was in Tenterfield I did go into their corner store bank. It is set up in a corner, there are full banking facilities, with three people behind the counter, all the logos, all the stuff that is there when you normally go into a bank, and it operates out of a local business. This is great news for local business because when people come into the hardware store to do their banking, they are obviously going to do some shopping as well. So it is win-win situation all around.</para><para>But we have to recognise that what the banks are doing here is cutting their overheads considerably, and those that are keeping open the in-store banking operations should be congratulated; they manage to cut their costs but still retain their service. One would hope that the banks would adopt a socially responsible position whereby if they were the last bank to leave town, from this point on, they would actually open one of these in-store branches and leave that sort of thing behind.</para><para>What we have to realise, as we move through to using this new technology in this new information age, is that some of the technology does not replace face-to-face 
 service. The government has introduced rural transaction services, which take up part of the slack. One would hope that this will substitute until the banks take a socially responsible position.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Breast Cancer</title><page.no>10110</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>10110</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death of Australian women. It is the most common cause of death from cancer in Australian women. On average, seven women die each day in Australia from breast cancer. In 1997, 2,602 Australian women died of breast cancer. October 25 is Australia's Breast Cancer Day. One of the great achievements of the Labor government was its initiation in 1990 of the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. Since then more than two million mammograms have been provided free of charge to women aged 40 and over.</para></talk.start><para>The national screening program has been targeted particularly to women in the 50 to 69 years age group, those most at risk. The likelihood of developing breast cancer increases with age. Over 70 per cent of breast cancers occur in women aged over 50 years. About one in every 11 women will get breast cancer at some stage. Only about one in 10 women who get breast cancer have a family history of breast cancer. Early detection and treatment gives women the best chance of overcoming this disease.</para><para>The national screening program is already showing positive results. Although the incidence of breast cancer is increasing, the death rate is decreasing. Since 1994 the number of deaths from breast cancer have declined a little each year. In 1995 there was a four per cent fall in the mortality rate from breast cancer in Australia and in 1996 a three per cent fall.</para><para>Every year approximately 7,500 women are diagnosed as having breast cancer. BreastScreen has had a target of a national participation rate of 70 per cent for women aged from between 50 to 69 years by 1999. The national participation rate for this age group for the 24 months to 1997 was 52.2 per cent but the rate varies from state to state. In the 
 ACT participation for this age group has now reached 68 per cent.</para><para>I wish to pay tribute to those brave women who have battled breast cancer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>—One, whom many senators and members knew, lost her fight on 23 August this year. She was Paula O'Brien, who worked for many years as a research librarian in the Parliamentary Library, first coming to Old Parliament House in 1973. Paula was unfailingly helpful, intelligent and good natured, with a quiet sense of humour which she may have needed to cope with our sometimes near impossible demands. She kept these qualities and her thoughtfulness for others throughout her illness. During a posting to Paris with her husband from 1996 to 1998 Paula hosted a number of visiting Australian parliamentarians and their families and they will remember her cheerful willingness to share with them the things in Paris that she loved. Paula was 46.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The cause of breast cancer is still unknown. Research into the causes, incidence and treatment of breast cancer is still of vital importance. In its 1994-95 budget the Labor government provided for the establishment of the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation for Breast Cancer Research and for the establishment of the National Health and Medical Research Council National Breast Cancer Centre, which provided $16.4 million over four years. To its credit, the present government has continued the commitment to these two bodies.</para><para>In Australia, some of the research has concerned the genes that cause cancer. Projects such as this link scientists and medical researchers across Australia. Work done at the Austin Research Institute in Melbourne and in the United States has raised hopes that a vaccine may in time be developed. Research is also under way on the possible linkage of a virus with breast cancer. Through the National Breast Cancer Centre the many groups working in research, client and service areas throughout Australia are brought together, and collaborative partnerships developed. </para><para>One of the needed areas for breast cancer research may be that of the incidence and early detection in women like Paula, younger than 50 years. Regular mammographic screening does not appear to be so useful for pre-menopausal women as the breast tissue is denser, making mammograms very difficult to read.</para><para>In recent times some criticism has been made of the attention now given to breast cancer. But this was a long neglected disease and many women died needlessly with too late diagnoses. The improved survival rate is due in large part to the awareness campaigns of the 1990s. Yet, while the incidence of deaths generally from breast cancer is falling, the potential years of life lost figure continues to rise, up from 29,420 potential years lost in 1995, to 31,418 potential years lost in 1997. The magnitude of the problem may be judged with the comparison of 5,930 potential years lost in 1997 through prostate cancer.</para><para>National data on the incidence of breast cancer in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women is still needed. It appears that the incidence of breast cancer in ATSI women is similar or slightly lower than in non-Aboriginal women. But this may be simply that there is a high rate of underreporting of cases. We don't really yet know. However, the death rate from breast cancer amongst ATSI women is slightly higher than that of non-Aboriginal women. In the two years from 1993 to 1995, 26 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged from 50 to 69 years had a mammogram with BreastScreen, compared with 37 per cent of non-Aboriginal women in this age group over the same period.</para><para>Access to breast screening services and to follow-up services for women diagnosed with breast cancer for ATSI women and for rural and regional women is still a major need. For these women there is a need to increase awareness about and encourage participation in screening and early detection programs. Training of ATSI health workers in this area and the development of specialised and accessible support services in rural areas should be priorities for this government.</para><para>Other priority needs identified at Australia's first national breast cancer conference for women in October last year were: more breast care nurses to follow women from diagnosis throughout treatment, ensuring that all women are provided with information at the time of diagnosis and before treatment; communication skills to be included in medical education and training; consumer representation in decision making related to breast cancer research and in the development and coordination of clinical trials; increased and continuing funding for medical, scientific and policy research; a national link for young women with breast cancer; and, finally, equitable access to clinical trials, therapies and drugs and to all support services for women with advanced breast cancer.</para><para>In closing, I would like to recognise all of the women who participated in the National Breast Cancer Network's field of women around Australia. I would also like to acknowledge the work of so many in our community and within the corporate sector who are prepared to offer their time and funds to the cause of raising awareness amongst women in this country about breast cancer. I would like to reiterate that National Breast Cancer Day on 25 October is an initiative most worthy of the support of all Australians. It is a time not only for us to remember those who have suffered from this disease, but also a time to celebrate the efforts of numerous scientists and health professionals across the country and around the world who contribute positively to breast cancer research.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Republic Referendum</title><page.no>10112</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>10112</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Two weeks ago a group of journalists were sharing a bowl of pasta and a plate of bruschetta in the cafe belt of Sydney, musing about the upcoming referendum with one or two of the intellectual giants of the republican debate—the yes case. The chat was about a dilemma facing the republicans: `Why won't the women support us? Why can't the girls understand our simple premise and just say yes?' No-one really had the answer and, as the cab sav warmed up the debate, and more than a few cheeks, out came this remarkable gem from a fearless republican general: `The 
 stupid housewives of Australia will lose us this debate. All the intelligent women know to vote yes. Why don't they?'</para></talk.start><para>Perhaps I can be of some assistance. The latest <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> poll, published last week—despite that newspaper's clear advocacy for a yes vote—shows that female readers still remain to be convinced. While 48 per cent of men declare themselves to be republicans, only 39 per cent of women agree. So the women of Australia in their thousands are questioning this republic, and for very good reasons.</para><para>Calls to my office indicate that women—and more than a few men—want to know why this referendum is a priority now, why it takes precedence over all the other important community issues that we are confronting: jobs for young people, the drugs problem, crime, health and so on. They are right of course—there are many more important matters on the government's agenda than this costly referendum. They have also become aware of the 69 changes which will be needed to the Constitution when there have been only a baker's dozen in the last 100 years, and they want to know what that will mean. They are correct again. Even the well-known republican Thomas Keneally has described it as `the biggest structural change to our Constitution'—or, to use Lachlan Murdoch's words, voting yes would bring about `our revolution'.</para><para>Women are worried about the costs of a change. As managers of the household budget, they are financially well informed, but there is no clear answer on this question. Nobody can say with any certainty what that cost will be on top of the estimated $120 million that has already been spent so far. `What a community priority', they say, and I agree with them. Then there is the important question they raise of the role of women in the political appointment process. Once again, they are right. Despite there being the largest number of elected women in the federal parliament ever in our history, the fact is that 75 per cent of members and senators are men. And women, particularly older working women, understand the magnitude of the built-in bias against the appointment of a woman as our President. On this issue, I agree 
 with the eminent lawyer and direct-elect republican Jocelynne Scutt, who said earlier this week:</para><para>If you have a presidential system that is controlled by the Prime Minister with the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition and then the endorsement of two thirds of the parliament, why on earth would we think that women have an equal chance of getting up under that system?</para><para>Why indeed? Dr Scutt continued:</para><para>In the end, I want a transparent system . . . the reality for me is that a transparent system does assist women . . . I want all women and men in Australia to know who the possibilities are for president, and to have a transparent system . . . </para><para>More than Dr Scutt are wise to the obstacles placed before women when it comes to being President, whether she was chosen or elected by all Australians. For while it is true that more women are being elected to the federal parliament, the fact is that 22 of them are in the Senate. This is where the shameful bias against not only women but also the rights of every state in this nation are revealed for all to see because, while the senators—male and female—representing their states will have a chance to vote in the selection process now being proposed, that is where the opportunities for our state representatives end.</para><para>If in the regrettable circumstance that this flawed model was accepted by a majority of states and, even more unfortunately, if the President was to be dismissed by the Prime Minister, where do you think the senators would be when a motion supporting his decision went before the House of Representatives? Absolutely nowhere! They will not be included in the debate or in the vote. There will be no joint sitting for this motion and no representatives of the states will be allowed into the House of Representatives to debate this Prime Minister's unilateral decision. Nowhere! There will be no senators—male or female—and no representatives of the states anywhere to be seen on the green carpet on that day. So much for states rights. As Dr Scutt may have noticed—because, as I have just observed, only members of the House of Representatives will vote on the dismissal motion—only 33 women will be involved in the vote or have an opportunity to take part in the debate.</para><para>Given that women comprise 52 per cent of the population or 9,502,848 people, affirmative action as well as democracy and state rights seem to be strangely absent on this occasion. The women of Australia are awake to it and they are questioning it in droves. They know a shonky model when they see one, and they know they are looking at one with this republican model that is on offer. Informal research indicates that the largest group of women who believe that the republic may be too much change are aged between 25 and 45, have children and usually manage the finances in their homes. They are the women who are already worried about this country's priorities for their children and grandchildren: what jobs they are going to have, what their health choices will be and, perhaps most important of all, the pervasive drugs scene in this country. These are the intelligent women of Australia, and they are well aware of the murky future of the model on offer. To quote that very brave republican general at the Sydney cafe:</para><para>All the intelligent people know to vote yes, why don't the women?</para><para>I have news for that fellow: the intelligent men and women of Australia have thought very carefully about the revolution that this republican model would deliver, and they are correctly voting no.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Occhilupo, Mr Mark</title><title>Republic Referendum</title><page.no>10113</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>10113</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to address two matters, the first of which relates to the outstanding achievement of Mark Occhilupo, who only a few days ago became the world professional surfing champion.

That is particularly because I am a lifelong resident of the Sutherland shire of Sydney and for many years lived in Cronulla. Of course, we in the Cronulla region not only believe but know that we have the greatest surfing beaches in Australia. Mark Occhilupo, as a very young boy, commenced his surfing career in the Cronulla region. He was quickly noticed because of his aggressive style of 
 surfing, which led to him being nicknamed the Raging Bull. He surfed waves in Cronulla and elsewhere like no one else had done before.

This, in particular, made it even more difficult for Mark to achieve success because surfing generally does not favour goofy-footers, just as golf generally does not favour left-handers. In his early years, Mark showed tremendous potential, and in his first three years—at the very young age of 16 and 17—he was No. 3 and No. 4 in the world. Unfortunately, he dropped out of surfing for a number of years. His life story in that regard has been well chronicled, and I do not have to go into it. But a couple of years ago, he returned to his great love of surfing, got back into fitness, and within two years he was back and has now achieved the status of world champion. He has done that at the age of 33, which is regarded as certainly well past the normal age at which people are likely to achieve such a world championship.</para><para>I believe it is appropriate that his great achievement be recognised. I understand that it is not possible for me to do so by way of a notice of motion because of the particular rules that apply to notices of motion. I wish that were different because, if we can have receptions for our sporting teams in this building and recognise them, I would have hoped that we could also do so by way of a particular resolution of the parliament. They are the rules and I accept them, but I think it is fitting that we do recognise him. The sporting world throughout Australia, certainly the people of our area in Sydney and indeed the surfing fraternity of the world have recognised that this is a truly great achievement, demonstrating personal dedication and determination by somebody who is a great ambassador for his sport and for his country.</para><para>In my remaining time, I turn to another subject which I have spoken about on a couple of occasions in the last two weeks and which is the same matter that has just been addressed by Senator Ferris—that is, the forthcoming referendum on 6 November. I listened with interest to Senator Ferris's remarks. She has claimed that the proposal to have an Australian head of state is a sexist proposal, a sexist model, and she has spoken tonight about why she believes the women of Australia will not vote for this. I have to say that I have never heard such a spurious argument in my life. What could be more sexist, what could be more of an insult to the intelligence of Australian women, than to have a system as we do now, which says that the head of state of Australia—who is also the head of state of the United Kingdom—must be the first born male heir of the royal family? If the first born male heir of the royal family is unable to take the crown for some particular reason, it shall then go to the next born male heir. That is why the next head of state of Australia will be Prince Charles, the eldest son of the current Queen.</para><para>If for some particular reason, as I have referred to in earlier debates, there are circumstances such as those that occurred in 1936, with the then Prince Edward, who became King Edward VIII, having to abdicate, who does the throne then extend to? It extends to the next male child. In that case it was George VI. In the case of the current royal family it would not be the next born child, Princess Anne, the female, who would take the crown; it would be Prince Andrew. Frankly, to have Senator Ferris stand up here tonight and attack the proposed republican model which would lead to an Australian head of state who could be a man or a woman, and to suggest that we should retain our current system based upon male hereditary right, where you must also be a member of the Church of England—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—What about Queen Elizabeth?

That is why the Queen is the current 
 head of state. But if subsequent to the birth of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret there had been a third child, a male child, he would have been the King. You know that. This puts the lie to this nonsense that is put about by Senator Ferris and others in the monarchist cause. They will stoop to the lowest level to run any nonsensical, spurious, mischievous and deliberately misleading argument to try and knock over this referendum. I believe that the intelligence of the Australian people, and the intelligence of Australian women, is far greater than Senator Ferris gives them credit for. If Senator Ferris thinks they are going to swallow that argument and swallow all of the other lies and distortions that have been put about by those supporting the monarchist cause, she should think again.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to close on this note. The question that needs to be answered by the monarchists—it has not been answered and they refuse to answer it because they know that they have no logical answer—is why it is that the United Kingdom is entitled to have its own head of state but that Australia is not. Why should we have the head of state of another country? Surely we have grown up enough. Surely we have been able to cope with change throughout this century. We have brought about a situation where we now have Australian governors-general rather than viscounts, dukes and lords from England. We have changed our legal system by abolishing appeals to the Privy Council. That did not destroy the legal system in this country. It was not a necessary change but it was one that was important symbolically and important for the total independence of this country. We have managed to change our legal system in that way and still retain our stable democracy. We can do so again with our own head of state on 6 November.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Republic Referendum</title><page.no>10115</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>10115</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a delight to be able to participate in this debate and pay a compliment to the excellent contribution of Senator Ferris in this debate.

When Malcolm Turnbull—possibly the general Senator Ferris was referring to, but we do not know—was asked at a forum in Sydney recently, `Can you look me in the eye and tell me that this is the best possible republican model for Australia?' Malcolm Turnbull stuttered, stalled, stumbled and sought to evade the question because he himself knows in his heart of hearts that it is an appalling model. The instant dismissal of the President is completely unacceptable and is a significant change to our Constitution. The Prime 
 Minister cannot sack the Governor-General in the same way. If you want proof of that, I suggest that people look at page 111 of Gough Whitlam's book <inline font-style="italic">The Truth of the Matter</inline>, where he confirms that very point. That is the real concern that many Australians have about the proposed model.

Centrelink is committed to providing a quality service to the public. The only circumstance where a Centrelink staff member has the option of not disclosing their full name is when they have been threatened or harassed by a customer. Under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991, Centrelink has a duty of care responsibility to protect the health and safety at work of its staff. Most customers do not behave in a manner which would require staff to adopt such a means of securing their safety. However, when a staff member is threatened or harassed by a customer, the staff member may choose to use only their first name in correspondence to the particular customer who has made a threat.</para><para>(2) Centrelink takes its responsibilities to both customers and staff seriously and does not believe that the protection of a staff member from a threatening and potentially unsafe situation, as outlined above, to be demeaning and disempowering for the customer.</para><para>(3) (a)The period between the time a job seeker becomes eligible for Intensive Assistance and their

In areas with a more active labour market, or more successful Job Network members, this turnover will be quicker and waiting times shorter.</para><para>It also depends on the number of eligible job seekers within a particular area. In areas where there are comparatively more eligible job seekers, the waiting time for referral could be longer.</para><para>(c) Yes it can. If the employment within a particular area increases and more job seekers in Intensive Assistance return to work, more vacancies are created with the Job Network members. Also, job seekers awaiting placement with a member may find work prior to referral and the waiting times in that area can decrease.</para><para>If there is a downturn in employment, and more job seekers are identified who are eligible for Intensive Assistance, the number of job seekers leaving Intensive Assistance to return to work may reduce and waiting times may increase.</para><para>(d) There is no maximum waiting time for referral to Intensive Assistance. However, each Intensive Assistance placement lasts for 12 to 18 months (with a possible extension of up to 6 months if the Job Network member believes an employment outcome is likely). As job seekers complete their Intensive Assistance placement or leave for other reasons such as employment, other job seekers are referred.</para><para>This ensures that there is a turnover of job seekers through Intensive Assistance giving each eligible job seeker a chance to participate.</para><para>(e) Waiting times are determined by the number of Intensive Assistance positions available in a particular area, the number of job seekers who have

At the time of the preparation of this response, most Annual Business Plans (ABPs) for 1999/2000 have also been lodged. Usually, ABPs are expected to be finalised in the quarter preceding the commencement of the financial year.
