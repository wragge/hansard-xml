What we are talking about here goes not just to legislation passed by this place—legislation of domestic impact—but also to this country's international reputation. Also its ramifications go to the fabric of our society. It goes to the issue of the Prime Minister's much heralded 10-point plan of legislation which was debated in the Senate less than a 
 year ago, and it goes to what the rest of the world sees as the impact of that legislation.</para><para>The 10-point plan was legislation that was widely condemned at the time of its introduction because it was basically legislation that overrode the views, wishes and interests of indigenous Australians. It was widely condemned at home because it was unfair and, we believe, discriminatory.</para><para>Those who argued very strongly against that legislation—indigenous Australians—felt that they had found no justice at home, so what they did was to seek justice abroad. This is not the first time it has happened, but it has to be of concern to all of us that this is part of an increasing trend. It is an increasing trend because many Australians now do not find a degree of fairness, fair go or justice from their national government. As a consequence, they are pursuing their rights and interests in the international forum.</para><para>Those who think that this debate is over, that the issue will be put to bed this morning if it does not get up, and that it will go away, should realise that they have something else coming to them. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has already indicated that Australia is on notice that it will maintain a watching brief in respect to our response to their decision and our response to the needs of indigenous Australians.</para><para>The government may have told them not to come to Australia; the government may have told them that our doors are closed to international concern; and the government may have told them that it would not welcome a visit. But I think it is fair to say that they will maintain an interest and keep on maintaining that interest as part of a growing body of international organisations that have concerns in respect of how Australia is performing, not just on indigenous matters, but also—as we know from debates in recent weeks—in respect of broader matters of cultural and environmental concern.</para><para>Once again we have hit the international headlines in a matter that is no good for our international reputation and in fact tarnishes that international reputation. This time it was the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
 Discrimination in its 54th session between 1 and 19 March that considered Australia's Native Title Act. Acting under its early warning procedures, the committee adopted a decision in respect to Australia, requesting information from Australia regarding three areas of concern: the proposed changes to the 1993 Native Title Act; changes of policy in respect to Aboriginal land rights; and changes in the position or functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. They were the matters that the committee embarked upon overviewing on 11 August 1998.</para><para>The committee in its deliberations welcomed the full and thorough reply of the Australian government. The Attorney-General himself in press statement after press statement indicated that he thought Australia was getting fair treatment and had an opportunity to put its case comprehensively to the committee.</para><para>It is also important to place on record that the committee received similarly detailed and useful comments from the Acting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. They got advice from ATSIC and there was advice from members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee undertook a broad assessment of Australia's practices in this area. They indicated their concern that:</para><para>. . . the effects of Australia's racially discriminatory land practices have endured as an acute impairment of the rights of Australia's indigenous communities.</para><para>That is the historical fact that they recognise in their decision. They also went on to recognise the importance of the Mabo decision. Mabo was a decision that ensured, for the first time, a rejection of the concept of terra nullius and an acceptance of the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had previously not been recognised. The committee also welcomed that the Native Title Act 1993 provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case. </para><para>The committee then went on to look at the 1993 act and compare it, most importantly, to the 1998 act. Having considered the amendments moved by the government to the 1993 act, they expressed concern over the compatibility of the government's amendments with the state party's—Australia's—international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. They said:</para><para>While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act.</para><para>The committee went on to say:</para><para>While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.</para><para>It comes as no surprise to those who took part in the debate in this place and those who followed it that there were four areas of major concern that the committee had in respect of the government's 10-point plan. There were four areas where the committee felt that the government's legislation acted in a racially discriminatory manner against indigenous Australians, and the committee listed them:</para><para>These include: the Act's "validation" provisions; the "confirmation of extinguishment" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.</para><para>These were the four areas that attracted most attention in this place during the course of that long debate. The committee, as did the previous government in 1993, recognised that there can be wind-back, but there is a capacity for the use of a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act and under the international convention which can accommodate a degree of negativeness if the overall package passed by the parliament can be seen to be positive. The committee said, of the four measures that they were concerned about:</para><para>. . . appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning 
 of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about—</para><para>Australia's compliance with articles 2 and 5 of the convention.</para><para>The committee was concerned about another aspect that we were also concerned about during the course of the debate. The committee found that there was a lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments. They were concerned with respect to the Howard government's compliance with its obligations under article 5(c) of the convention. That article and the committee's general recommendations have stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life'—not just cursory or token participation, but effective participation in public life. An important principle that they hold, which is reflected in the convention, is that no decisions directly relating to indigenous people's rights and interests should be taken without their informed consent.</para><para>Concern after concern is expressed by this international eminent committee on the elimination of race discrimination—concerns that in many respects reflect the concerns that indigenous Australians had during the passage of the Howard Wik 10-point plan.</para><para>The committee had further concerns about the broader agenda in respect of indigenous Australians which Australia has embarked upon under the Howard government. They were concerned that Australia had proposed to change the overall structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, abolishing the position of ATSI Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist deputy president. They felt there was a need for a qualified specialist to address matters affecting indigenous Australians given the continuing political, economic and social marginalisation of the indigenous community in Australia.</para><para>Having made all these findings, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on Australia to take certain action. They also indicated—and this is 
 probably the most telling of their recommendations:</para><para>In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by—</para><para>Australia—</para><para>to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session.</para><para>So there you have it—fundamentally important findings of discrimination against Australia which this committee says they will keep on their early warning system and keep a watching brief over. So the government has been put on notice, but the government, we know, will not react. The government's basic attitude to these sorts of matters is to take the view of the Prime Minister that the rest of the world is only there to play cricket against and `we won't take them into account when it comes to their views of how we perform'. But this is a short-sighted policy, a policy that basically limits Australia's role, and capacity to play a role, in international affairs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Indonesia doesn't even have a cricket team, you dope.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Senator Campbell, you talk about Indonesia not having a cricket team.

That is affecting us here. 
 Time after time, whether it is by the ILO, this committee or the World Heritage Committee, we are getting a reflection not just against the Howard government but against this nation. If we have got any respect for the role and the status of this nation in world affairs, and if John Howard, the Prime Minister, and Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, are not going to take action, are not going to respond, are not going to treat people with civility, it is important for this parliament to stand up for the reputation of Australia. Senator Campbell, you may not care about it, but I tell you what: if you are doing business, if you are interacting with the rest of the world, then you are concerned about Australia's status and the respect which the rest of the world may or may not show us from time to time.</para><para>What did the government do? They got this broad, condemnatory decision from the committee. It was a decision which should not have been of surprise to them, either. It was a decision which was in accordance with advice given to the government during the debate. Robert Orr, of the Wik task force, on 17 November 1997 produced an advice to government. In that private advice to government—and it is worth putting all of this on the record—he said, by way of a question time brief:</para><para>On 3 February 1997, the Commonwealth received advice from Mr D F Jackson QC that legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).</para><para>So the government's own external advice was basically being confirmed by the committee. But let us go on. Contact officer Robert Orr continued his brief by saying:</para><para>Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA—</para><para>let us keep in mind that the Racial Discrimination Act incorporates the international covenant into Australian law—</para><para>and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power. In summary, 
 Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997—</para><para>that is almost two years ago—</para><para>that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law provision), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.</para><para>So this international committee, charged with oversighting compliance with the international covenant on the elimination of racial discrimination, is saying what the government's own Chief General Counsel has said to this government, and also saying what the external advice said to the government. These are just two avenues of internal advice to the government. The broader advice presented to the Senate committee inquiring into this matter also confirmed that.</para><para>Although the Attorney-General, on 11 March this year, said that the government took its international obligations seriously and was keen to assist the UN committee, on 16 March he said that Australia welcomed the chance to present a detailed case to the committee and had informed the committee of an extensive process of consultation. The Attorney-General began the big lie in that press statement. On the second page he said:</para><para>The Australian Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that the Government has not breached the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para>He told the Australian public that the view of the government was that there was no breach of the convention, when the advice to the government from its most eminent legal sources was that the government had breached the convention. What did he do after the decision from CERD? What was the government's response then? That is reflected once again in a press statement from the Attorney-General. He said:</para><para>The Committee's comments are an insult to Australia and all Australians as they are unbalanced and do not refer to the submission made by Australia on the native title issue. 
</para><para>He is shooting the international messenger who has told him internationally what he knows and has known domestically for quite some time—that we have been, and we are, in breach of the international covenant.</para><para>So the government says the committee's comments are unbalanced; it shoots the messenger and tries to reflect on the reputation and capacity of the international forum which takes a very dark view of what we have done on this matter. The Attorney-General went on to say:</para><para>The Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that Australia has not breached the Convention . . . </para><para>The advice to the government from its most senior legal advisers was that we had breached the convention. That is the second lie. He went on by giving the normal, gratuitous flicks around the ears that we are used to from this government to committees like this and to the World Heritage Committee. He said:</para><para>The comments by the committee are unbalanced and fail to understand Australia's system of democracy.</para><para>Is he saying that Chief General Counsel Burmester failed to understand Australia's system of democracy? Is he saying that Mr Jackson QC failed to understand it? Is he saying that they are unbalanced? If that is the case, they ought to be removed from their offices of privilege in advising the government. He does not say that of those people who have given the government the same advice, but he does say that in regard to the international committee. Basically, that means that the government is not taking serious action here. The rest of the world has a continuing interest. The <inline font-style="italic">Guardian Weekly</inline> , just a few weeks ago, said `Washed away in a tide of white history'—one expression of international concern about how we are handling this matter at home.</para><para>In closing the debate, let us put on record that the government is not taking this seriously and we should. Let us also put on record that there is a degree of resonance between the response which Mr Howard has given and the response, for instance, taken by Mr Smith in Africa quite a few years ago. The Prime 
 Minister says, `Our official view is that Australian laws are made by Australian parliaments elected by the Australian people, not by a UN committee.' Haven't we heard that before? Haven't we heard that from an international regime that rejects international scrutiny of its domestic practices, especially when those practices are so offensive to the basic law of humanity that has been not just accepted by Australia but sponsored by Australia? The UN convention was one of those conventions that we were in the forefront of implementing internationally, but our position now basically is, `We can do at home whatever we want and the rest of the world can go jump.' In the long-term interests of Australia, we cannot afford that to be the view emanating from this parliament. It may be the view which the Prime Minister is happy with, but we should not be. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>4522</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion of Senator Bolkus and indicate the support of the Australian Democrats for it. In doing so, I will not repeat all of the issues raised by Senator Bolkus—he covered the issue very well—but there are a couple of things I want to add to the debate. The first thing I want to say is that we should congratulate those indigenous leaders who presented the case before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for their persistence, for their obvious intelligence and for the very comprehensive way in which they detailed the case. This country owes a lot to indigenous leaders who no longer—as I think was once inferred in the minds of many people in this country—need the help of white Australians in presenting these kinds of cases.</para></talk.start><para>Certainly in this case and in many others they are more than capable of presenting a case on their own behalf and, in this instance, not only did so on the issue which they were supporting but also did so against the very best bureaucratic advice that this government could mount on the other side. It sent its most senior bureaucrat, the person who in fact designed the native title amendment laws. He was unable, over and against the arguments put by the indigenous leaders, to convince the 
 CERD committee of the government's position. That is very significant and those indigenous leaders who presented the case need our congratulations and our support. Obviously they were able to convince an international forum in the face of the very best bureaucratic ability that the government could mount.</para><para>I would also like to indicate that individually Senator Reynolds, Mr Melham and I invited by letter—not necessarily representing our parties, but as individuals—the CERD committee to visit Australia. We are not yet sure of the status of that visit, whether or not it will happen, because once again the government does not want scrutiny of its actions or of its legislative program. I do hope that the committee will visit Australia because, even if the government believes that it is right in this particular issue, this would present the government with an opportunity to argue its case, to show how the CERD committee has got it wrong, as the government asserts. The best way to resolve that would be to have the CERD committee visit Australia and to hear both sides of the debate on the ground, face to face. I would be very surprised if the government opposes this visit because it would give the government an opportunity to present its case and would give an opportunity not only to the international forum to observe but also to all Australians to make a judgment about the arguments on both sides.</para><para>I am in a way ashamed that the CERD committee found that Australia was guilty of discrimination, but not surprised. I have firmly believed all along, right from the beginning of the publishing of the 10-point plan by the Prime Minister, that that 10-point plan would work to the significant disadvantage of indigenous people. I believe that to be absolutely right, and this has now been confirmed by this international forum. The Native Title Amendment Bill, as amended and then passed by the Senate and by the House of Representatives, is undoubtedly discriminatory. I am convinced of that. I believe that, eventually, if it comes before the High Court of Australia, it will be found to be discriminatory, as has been found in this international forum. </para><para>I am bemused by the way in which this government argues that some international forums should not be listened to when at the same time other international forums are not only listened to but slavishly followed to the detriment of many Australians. Of course I refer to the World Trade Organisation, before whom we grovel to the great detriment of many of the primary industries of this country. We are prepared to grovel before that international forum when it is to do with trade issues, but when it comes to human rights issues we take no notice of international forums or of their criticisms of this country.</para><para>We support the motion to refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I trust that it will pass, because this is another opportunity for the whole issue to be considered. It is very important that we, in the Senate and in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, look carefully at what has been said by the CERD committee and that we revisit this issue. If we do not, it will continue to attract international criticism for as long as we allow it to be a blot on this country's previous good reputation in the area of human rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4523</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise in support of the motion moved by Senator Bolkus to refer the Native Title Act 1993, as amended in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry. I do that because, having taken considerable interest in the bill when it was debated and in the process leading up to that, I realised that a great many questions were left unanswered. One of the most instructive elements of the committee process leading up to us dealing with the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 was the fora to which some of the best silks in the country came and discussed the constitutionality. That was very stimulating. It was probably almost unprecedented to have that kind of fora dealing with a particular issue of a bill. Here we have brought up another element of the same bill—that is, whether the bill abides by Australia's international commitments.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Woodley is quite right when he says that the current Australian government 
 picks and chooses which international fora it abides by. When the World Trade Organisation, or perhaps even the World Bank, says, `Jump', the Australian government says, `How high?' I guess that jumping high has come from the previous government as well, in that we not only did what we were required to do under the Uruguay Round of GATT but we went beyond that, many believe naively, on the assumption that we would benefit. That has meant considerable change in and interference with Australia's domestic laws.</para><para>We have seen the introduction of national competition policy before many other countries have gone that way. We are now only just beginning to look at that. We have never in this country looked at the impact of Australia signing the Uruguay Round of GATT. We have never done that as a Senate inquiry, much to my sadness. Here we have a situation where an international body, having looked at Australia's laws in relation to the Native Title Act, have said, `In our opinion, this does not abide by Australia's international commitments.'</para><para>Unfortunately, what I saw many times during the debate was throwaway lines and debating points in relation to human rights. I recall a number of comments about racial discrimination and whether the process of not allowing consultation or the right to negotiate on land was racially discriminatory. In the debate the government frequently used an argument which assumed terra nullius—that is, that the country was empty—and that Aboriginal people had to abide by the rules of leaseholders or other people who did not own the land. So we had a situation where the throwaway debating points in relation to whether the bill itself was racially discriminatory had an in-built assumption of terra nullius—the very assumption that the High Court had thrown away in saying that the country was not empty when white settlers came. This is pretty basic; it is not about throwaway lines or debating points or things that you say on a broadcast day. It is about whether in legal terms, under Australia's laws and Australia's Constitution, we are doing something in a bill which is against Australia's international obligations.</para><para>The government has almost run out of international fora to abuse in recent times. We have seen issues relating to immigration, refugees, the treatment of Australia's indigenous population, the environment and uranium mining—they are almost running out of international fora to abuse. We are getting comments from other legislatures, including in Europe, Japan and the United States. Quite frankly, I think people going overseas these days would have to wear a paper bag over their head in many different fora.</para><para>I am also hearing things from business people. I shared a plane with a business person—a conservative business person—who was operating a great deal in London, who said that it is getting very difficult to do business in Europe and even in Britain because of Australia's international reputation. This government seems to be mostly interested in business so they should at least be interested in the fact that we are dirtying our reputation to such an extent that people do not even want to do business with us.</para><para>We should make sure that as a parliament we look into the elements of this bill and that the committee has a chance to report. We should once again invite some of the best legal minds in the country—they are usually willing to come to these interesting and historic debates to find out what the issues really are. We do not just want debating points or throwaway lines. We want to find out what the weight of opinion says so that we can best deal with this issue in the future. Quite clearly, the Greens (WA) support this motion. I would like to think the government is prepared to look at it as well. Either way, I hope this motion gets majority support in the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>4524</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to support my colleague's motion in relation to the Native Title Act and the decision of the United Nations committee. I think we have to be mindful when we sit in chambers such as this that laws that we pass are not always perfect and do not always encompass the intent or the purpose. They are there for scrutiny and, if we ever believe for one minute that we pass laws that are to stay there in concrete, then 
 we are doing a disservice to the people we serve. Those laws are there to be tested and to be tried in courts. In a way I believe that the United Nations is another form of this process of checks and balances in which our laws can be put up and examined.</para></talk.start><para>All Australians should be particularly concerned about this decision. We are in an era of reconciliation. We are in an era when we are trying to teach our children and when we encourage the idea, even amongst our own peers, that discrimination is not a good thing, that it is something you do not do, that it is something you should be embarrassed to do. We now have, on a broader scale, an international body which is closely watching and monitoring laws of other countries but more so Australia in the last three years. It has come up with a decision that we now should take note of. We should be forging the way here and setting an example for the rest of the world to follow. It seems that we have gone mightily backwards in the last three years when a United Nations committee has made a decision that the Native Title Act is in breach of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para>This convention was actually signed in 1966 under a Holt Liberal government. It was ratified in 1975. So this convention has actually been looked at by governments of Australia twice. We have signed up and then ratified the convention—over a long period of years now. I am going back 23 years, so it is something that we have been committed to for quite a while. The committee has decided on and issued an unambiguous statement, I think, that this government is committing racial discrimination. They say that we are in breach of articles 2 and 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para>Aboriginal people in this country have welcomed a decision and statement by an international body, the United Nations committee. They have been pressing this government for many years to try to make some positive moves towards consulting with them, to listening to them, to sitting down and trying to understand where they want to go. 
 But they have to look to an international forum to get the recognition they want. On the very day that the United Nations committee handed down this decision, ATSIC put out a press release saying that indigenous people of Australia welcome the CERD findings. In my own electorate of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people are talking about this—such as occurred two weeks ago in Broome and Kununurra. They are not excited about it, they are not happy that they have had to go outside this country to try to find the kind of recognition and realisation that what is happening to them is not right. But they are pleased that somebody is taking notice.</para><para>This government is not pleased that somebody is taking notice. In fact, this government is embarrassed. This government does not want to know about the United Nations decisions. Last year we saw this government push through the laws for the Native Title Act. As Senator Margetts said, we had discussions about whether this act would be discriminatory. We had comments about it. The comments were either fobbed off or we were reassured that the act was not discriminatory.</para><para>A couple of weeks ago, the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA, in their submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, said that they had reservations about the processes that this parliament undertakes. They were specifically talking about the operation of this joint parliamentary committee. In their submission they made a reference to the United Nations CERD decision. In particular, they wanted to emphasise recommendation XIII which stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent'.</para><para>They raised that in the context of the joint parliamentary committee, because they are saying that the committee is only being seen to happen; it takes submissions from Aboriginal people, from pastoralists and companies but it really does not change the substance of the act or the position of this 
 government. So it is almost like a token consultation. So they looked to the United Nations for confirmation of this and they got it. They got the United Nations saying, `That is right. We believe that the actions of this government do not take notice of your effective participation and do not bother to get your consent when forming their laws.'</para><para>So let us have a look at why people—and particularly Aboriginal people—believe that the legislation is in breach of the international convention. It does not protect the land ownership of Aboriginal people. It is clearly the instrument which increases the legal ownership rights over land held by non-Aboriginal parties such as pastoralists. It increases the other land ownership rights, to the corresponding detriment of the Aboriginal peoples. And in all instances where invalid titles occur through duplication of ownership, it prefers the interests in land of non-Aboriginal people over the interests of Aboriginal people. It manifestly interferes with Aboriginal landowners' rights to negotiate their interests over their land and it does not have the informed consent of Aboriginal peoples.</para><para>I am calling on this government to take urgent action to redress this situation and to give close scrutiny to whether or not this legislation is racially discriminatory. I do not see that there is a problem with that. As I said earlier, we do make laws, and laws are not always perfect. Perhaps it is time to actually sit back and say, `Well, let's have a look at this. We have had Aboriginal people who are not happy with it. We now have a decision of the United Nations.' I think the government are paying a high price for this folly; a very high price for their blindness and their unwillingness to say, `Perhaps there is a problem here.' The price is, of course, their international reputation. As I said, they signed up and ratified this convention twice, and they have now broken their word.</para><para>Since the decision of the United Nations committee has come down, this government has sought to question the legitimacy of the United Nations committee's decision. Coming from the Northern Territory, I would have to say it is shades of Kakadu and Jabiluka here. 
 If the decision does not actually fall over the line for us, we turn around and say, `You people really aren't experts after all and perhaps you don't really know what you are talking about.' Unlike Jabiluka, where the excuse was that they are not really scientists and they do not know what they are doing, in this case the excuse is, `You don't understand how Australian law operates.' This committee does understand what racial discrimination is, it does understand about the needs of indigenous people and it certainly understands what it means to actually talk to, listen to and consult with these people and have their consent.</para><para>As Senator Bolkus mentioned earlier, the government's own Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester, advised this government on 25 July 1997. He said:</para><para>. . . in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act or CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime . . . and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of coexisting native title rights.</para><para>In supporting this recommendation Australians, and particularly indigenous Australians, are now entitled to know whether this government has enacted a law which has subsequently been found to be discriminatory or whether they blatantly knew all along that it was discriminatory and they did so knowing this. I think we all have a right to know the answer to that. The fundamental moral obligation of all Australian governments is not to discriminate on the basis of race. This Native Title Act has been found to be racially discriminatory by the United Nations, and it may well be confirmed to be so by this Senate inquiry. I call on the government to change its law and to make sure that it complies with both our international and our moral obligations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4526</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to support this motion by Senator Bolkus. I believe it is appropriate for the Legal and Constitutional References Committee of the Senate to look very closely at the UN decision and to report back to the Senate. I was disappointed last week when what I considered to be a relatively mild 
 motion was defeated in this place. In that motion I asked that the Senate express its grave concern about the CERD report. The Senate did not agree with that. Yet, as other speakers have said, how can the Senate not be concerned that the international law making body, the United Nations, has found that there are questions to answer about whether or not we are upholding the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? We should be concerned, and that is all the first part of my original motion was saying.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, if we are concerned, we should have been prepared to deal with this issue. This issue has not come before the Senate on the initiative of the government. It has not come before the House of Representatives on the initiative of the government. It has been brought up only by opposition members in this place. I think the government should demonstrate that it has some concern and some plan as to how it is going to respond. Thirdly, I ask the government to reopen discussions with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That is not a very radical proposition, I would have thought. Sooner or later someone is going to have to talk and someone is going to have to resolve this concern. The government cannot hide from it.</para><para>Finally, the Senate could have invited the United Nations committee to visit Australia and look at the issues first-hand. The government apparently is not going to invite the committee. The committee no doubt will not come in a formal sense if the government has not invited it, but there is no doubt that the committee members will visit in their own right and will talk with Aboriginal people, will talk with all those many hundreds of people who contacted them in the months leading to their deliberations. The chair of the committee said in his comments after the hearing that the expressions of concern and the numbers of submissions received from Australia and from ordinary Australians were unprecedented, and still the government refuses to take this matter seriously.</para><para>What will happen in the processes if we do not make a response between now and 
 August? That will be reported to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in a session later this year, some time in November or December. Is that what we want? Is that what our diplomats want? Is that what the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister want? Do we really want the issue aired in the General Assembly that we have been found wanting in upholding the racial discrimination convention? Are we not prepared to even talk about it?</para><para>It is a head in the sand attitude by the government because sooner or later they will have to address this. Sooner or later they will have to talk with Aboriginal people. Sooner or later they will have to confront this issue, if necessary, in the courts because the finding of the CERD committee gives enormous weight to the legal arguments that have been put on behalf of indigenous people. For the government to just try to hide and say, `Aboriginal people shouldn't go overseas airing dirty linen in public,' is nonsense. Indigenous people and spokespeople for indigenous people have been going overseas to complain about Australia's treatment of indigenous people for over a hundred years. There are any number of examples of people taking their concern about the treatment of indigenous people outside Australia simply because they could not get action in this country. Back in colonial society days, the Anti-Slavery Society was expressing concern about the way indigenous people were being treated in this country, so there is nothing new about indigenous people and/or their supporters and advocates expressing concern in the international community.</para><para>What else do you do? If you cannot get action at home, you have to appeal outside. Look at what has happened in other countries. We take it for granted, when human rights abuses are not being addressed within countries, that activists and spokespeople will make appeals outside to make them international issues. If we do not want the rights of indigenous people to be an international issue, we have to deal with this issue at home. We 
 could deal with it at home simply if government learned to talk with indigenous people and learned to compromise instead of just bulldozing through and assuming that a piece of legislation can wipe off the planet the rights of indigenous people. If these were your property rights, Mr Acting Deputy President, or mine we would find that there would be absolute uproar if they were just—at the stroke of a pen through a piece of legislation—taken from us.</para><para>Gay McDougall, the committee expert who served as country rapporteur for the situation in Australia, said that indigenous land rights were unique and `encompassed a traditional and cultural connection to the land that had been recognised in international law'. That is a fact. Governments might not like it but it is a fact. Governments have to deal with it unless they want to cut themselves off completely from the international community. She said the international community now understood that doctrines of dispossession were `illegitimate and racist'.</para><para>We do not like the word `racist' and I agree that it can be bandied around as a term of abuse indiscriminately, if you will forgive the poor attempt at a pun, and I do not believe in calling people or governments `racist'. But the reality is that international law has shown that doctrines of dispossession are illegitimate and racist whether we like that term or not. It is like the term `genocide'. People get very upset about it and say, `No, we weren't ever involved in genocide.' We were—literally—and the fact that we do not like the word is irrelevant. The government policy in the past to systematically remove Aboriginal children from their families and culture was a form of genocide and that is a fact, just as the doctrines of dispossession are racist.</para><para>One of these days this government—and indeed future governments—will have to come to terms with it; they will have to deal with it. People in this country will demand it; the international community will demand it. Ms McDougall noted that the delegation had said several times that `the Australian government believed that it could not go back and cure the injustices of the past'. She said she could see some merit in that view—she is a 
 reasonable person—but what concerned her was that the validation and confirmation of extinguishment provisions in the amended act, that is, the Wik legislation, did not apply to the distant past; they appeared to apply to actions that in some cases had taken place as recently as 1994 and 1996. She said she would welcome a discussion within the committee about how experts might continue their urgent deliberations on Australia's situation beyond the conclusion of the current session.</para><para>I want to go back to the fact that at the moment there is on the books of the CERD committee a decision that is adverse to Australia and its international reputation and that, as far as I am aware, no-one within the government are doing anything about it. Senator Bolkus has raised a practical proposition of referring the decision to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That would be a good start, but he is a member of the opposition. Other senators, including Senator Margetts and Senator Woodley, have expressed concern about this issue, as have members of the other place. But all that the government representatives—Senator Herron, Mr Ruddock and the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams—have done is to deny that this is an issue and say, `They're biased. They don't understand Australia.' Well, they would like to understand Australia better by visiting some time in late June or early July.</para><para>But can they get an official invitation? They certainly could not get an official invitation from this Senate because the government would not support it. That is fair enough—the government should be doing the inviting. But the government is not inviting the committee. I challenge the ministerial representative in the chamber at the moment to report back to the Senate and let us know whether it is the government's intention to officially invite the committee. If the government are so sure that their legislation is non-discriminatory, if they are so proud of their relationship with indigenous people, what have they got to be scared of? Why are they avoiding scrutiny? But, if they do have something of a conscience and they want to avoid this scrutiny, do they really think it is going to help in the 
 long run when the committee has to report to the United Nations General Assembly in November or December that there has been a failure to respond and no dialogue on this subject?</para><para>I say to the government in as bipartisan way as I can muster, which is obviously fairly difficult for me on this side of the house, that this issue is not going to go away. Government members may say, `There goes the opposition bad mouthing the government,' but I am not particularly criticising the government. I am simply saying that government has to deal with it. That is why we elect governments. It is not in the interests of Australia, as Senator Margetts and Senator Crossin said, to ignore this and hope that somehow it will go away. It will not go away.</para><para>For instance, already there is a European Network for Indigenous Australian Rights in London. On 22 March 1999 there was an Aboriginal call for British responsibility at Westminster. So this issue was being raised in London. I have here the US Department of State Australia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998. It is quite a lengthy report on Australia's human rights practices. It contains a couple of pages of comment that is scarcely complimentary about the problems Australia has with indigenous rights. Of course, government can say, and I would say, that the US Department of State might look at its own practice in terms of human rights—the United States has the death penalty and Australia does not. Every country has reason to explain their policies in regard to human rights.</para><para>Australia in 1992 was praised, was held up as a fine example, by the very same committee that is now critical. When I say that we were praised, I do not mean that everything the former government—the then Keating government—did in regard to indigenous rights was absolutely perfect. I was critical of my own government at that time on a number of issues. But the last time we appeared before the CERD committee it was generally recognised that Australia was moving in a very positive direction. There had been the landmark High Court case, the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 Commission and the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and it seemed that, with the independent reporting of both the minister and ATSIC, there was progression in the recognition of indigenous rights generally in Australia. That is why I believe the committee has been shocked by the changes that have occurred in recent years.</para><para>In conclusion, I seek leave to incorporate into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the decision on Australia of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at its 54th session, 1-19 March 1999. This has been reported in the media, but the full text of it has not been tabled in the lower house.

The Committee welcomes the full and thorough reply of the Commonwealth Government of Australia to this request for information (CERD/C/347).

Queensland, noting that in recognizing the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had not otherwise been validly extinguished, the High Court case constituted a significant development in the recognition of Indigenous rights under the Convention. The Committee welcomed, further, the Native Title Act of 1993, which provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case.</para><para>6.	 The Committee having considered a series of new amendments to the Native Title Act, as adopted in 1998, expresses concern over the compatibility of the Native Title Act, as currently amended, with the State Party's international obligations under the Convention. While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act. While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.</para><para>7.	 The Committee notes, in particular, four specific provisions that discriminate against indigenous title-holders under the newly amended Act. These include the Acts's "validation" provisions; the "confirmation of extinguishment" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.</para><para>8.	 These provisions raise concerns that the amended Act appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about the State Party's 
 compliance with Articles 2 and 5 of the Convention.</para><para>9.	 The lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments also raises concerns with respect to the State Party's compliance with its obligations under Article 5(c) of the Convention. Calling upon States Parties to "recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their common lands, territories and resources," the Committee, in its General Recommendation XXIII, stressed the importance of ensuring "that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent."</para><para>10.	 While welcoming the State Party's recognition of the important role that has been played by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Committee also notes with concern the State Party's proposed changes to the overall structure of the Commission; abolishing the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist Deputy President. The Committee strongly encourages the State Party to consider all possible effects of such a restructuring, including whether the new Deputy President would have sufficient opportunity to address in an adequate manner the full range of issues regarding indigenous peoples warranting attention. Consideration should be given to the additional benefits of an appropriately qualified specialist position to address these matters, given the continuing political, economic and social marginalization of the indigenous community of Australia.</para><para>11.	 The Committee calls on the State Party to address these concerns as a matter of utmost urgency. Most importantly, in conformity with the Committee's General Recommendation XXIII concerning Indigenous Peoples, the Committee urges the State Party to suspend implementation of the 1998 amendments and re-open discussions with the representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with a view to finding solutions acceptable to the indigenous peoples and which would comply with Australia's obligations under the Convention.</para><para>12.	 In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by the State Party to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session. 
</para><para>I thank the Senate. In my concluding remarks I again make a plea to the government to recognise that no problem or embarrassment that they feel they are facing in regard to this issue will disappear by being ignored. There is always a view within government—and my government was no different—that, when something is in the too hard basket and people do not quite know what to do with it, if you leave it in the too hard basket long enough it will somehow dissipate and disappear. Indigenous issues and the rights of indigenous Australians will always be with us and will always be the subject of international focus until we learn to work in a realistic cooperative way with indigenous peoples. They will be there at the Olympic Games, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, at the United Nations and when individual members and senators travel overseas. I challenge anyone in this chamber to say they have never been asked about the policies of governments, regardless of the political complexion of governments.</para><para>It is an issue that has been raised with me not just by people on formal delegations. A taxi driver asked me, `Are you still locking up your Aboriginal people?' because he had some knowledge of the Aboriginal deaths in custody report. I have spoken to other people who in no way are well informed but who nevertheless know that Australia has this reputation. We have to deal with the rights of indigenous peoples. Whatever the government may feel about Senator Bolkus's motion, I urge them to be open-minded. It can only assist in the process of assessing the concerns of the CERD committee and what action the Senate can recommend that the government put in process to change the way people throughout the world are looking at Australia at the moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4530</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The speakers before me have gone into many matters that show how crucial this issue is. I do not want to repeat the arguments and propositions that have been put before the Senate, but I do want to talk about the issue of process. Process is often thought of as a very dull topic, and it is—people want to  get to the issues where the imagination, the soul 
 and the heart can soar. Process is simply a means of getting there, but it is important. We are a member of the United Nations organisation, and we are entitled to make criticisms of the way it goes about its tasks and of the conventions it produces, but, as a member, we should take seriously the processes by which it carries out its work.</para></talk.start><para>Take the World Trade Organisation, for example. We have international commitments in trade and commerce. We disagree with a lot of the things that the bodies associated with the World Trade Organisation and world commerce do. We get upset when they say we should allow the importation of products from overseas which we think would harm us here. Nevertheless, we go ahead with it because unless we are prepared to say, `We are in on this arrangement, and we are going to stick by it even though it harms us,' what is the point of going into the arrangement? You might as well withdraw.</para><para>In the present instance, a unit of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia and our conduct in a particular area. Do we then say, `Look, that criticism has been made but we will take no notice of it. When we go into an organisation like the United Nations organisation, we'll only take notice of what is in our favour'? If we did, the whole system would not work. If the only time we turned up at court was when we were going to win, the whole system would collapse. In the same way, if we are only going to take notice of world bodies when they say something that suits us, but when it does not we walk away, then the whole thing is devalued, there is not much point in belonging to it and we might as well get out.</para><para>An organisation of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia, and Senator Bolkus has proposed that we refer the matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee—of which I am a member—where the statement made by this body of the United Nations can be looked at calmly. Submissions can be received from those who say that there is merit in the resolution and from those who say there is not. It seems to me that if the Senate is not prepared to at least have a look at what the United Nations body has said, 
 then it is skating around this important issue of process. It is skating around the obligation to look at what is said and to see what it makes of it.</para><para>Taking into account and giving due weight to everything that has been said, one of the central points is how we as a nation, having joined a body voluntarily, treat the sorts of things they say. If we treat them as being not worth much—if we treat them on a discounted basis—then why belong to the world body? As I said before, if we belong to bodies that try to get world trade into a state where it benefits everyone, and we say, `We don't want to listen to you on certain issues,' then we ought to get out of the world body because otherwise we will corrupt the whole process. If you are in an organisation and you do not live by its processes, you corrupt the processes and, ultimately, the body, and the honourable thing to do would be to get out of it. But if you are in them you should treat seriously the sorts of things those bodies say.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>4531</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree, as I very often do, with the honourable senator, Senator Cooney, who has just resumed his seat. Process is a very important matter indeed. We should under that circumstance certainly treat as being of worth what CERD say, but they should also treat as being of worth what Australia says. In this instance they did not; in fact they ignored what Australia said. That is something which I believe all Australians, indigenous as well as non-indigenous, should be concerned about.</para></talk.start><para>The detailed legal submissions provided by Australia, both orally and in writing, were largely ignored. They were not referred to in the CERD decision. The portions of the committee's decisions, paragraphs 6 to 8, dealing with the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 could have been written in their entirety prior to the receipt of Australia's submissions. Is that process?</para><para>The discriminatory character of the act is asserted without any effort to explain or substantiate the conclusion in terms of the law and of the convention. There is no reflection of the countervailing benefits provided to indigenous communities under the legislation, 
 although this constituted a substantial part of Australia's submissions. Surely it should have been reasonable to expect that Australia's claims in this regard might at least have been noted. But there is no reference to them.</para><para>The conclusions in paragraph 10 of the CERD committee report to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner omit any reference to the assurances provided to the committee concerning the ongoing functions of the position. I can go on with list after list where Australia's views were not even acknowledged in the report. I do believe it is very important not to use this issue, either locally or internationally, as a political football. That is why I agree with Senator Cooney about process.</para><para>Let us now cast our minds back, if you will, to last year. All honourable senators will remember that the debate on the native title legislation was the longest debate in this chamber since Federation. Let us also understand what happened: there was a breakdown; there was a deadlock prior to Easter. Easter seems to visit me with difficulties.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COONEY</name><name role="display">Senator Cooney</name></talker><para>—It is a great season, though.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Yes. It is the last week of Lent so we had all to suffer it. I am sorry you had to suffer me, too; nevertheless, the matter unfortunately came down to my vote. The sticking points following the collapse of the Senate debate prior to Easter were the threshold test, the Racial Discrimination Act, the sunset clause and the right to negotiate. After 10 days of negotiations with the government the result, on any fair assessment, was a win for the indigenous people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me explain the position as a result of that. The government's registration test was substantially softened to enable the children of the stolen generation and the victims of the locked gate practices to have their native title claims registered. This allows them access to the benefits of the act. The government backed down on the Racial Discrimination Act. As you will recall, they had put a sunset clause in the legislation, but now the Native Title Act is able to be read and construed by reference to the Racial Discrimination Act. Going to the six-year sunset clause, after 
 which time the government believed that no indigenous group could lodge a claim under the act—a much easier mechanism than a common law action, which they would have been forced to—on my insistence the government scrapped that sunset clause.</para><para>On the fourth sticking point, the right to negotiate, registration gave native title claimants access to the provisions of the act, including the right to negotiate with other titleholders. The government was opposed to any right to negotiate for native title claimants on pastoral leases granted by states and territories. I wanted to have the so-called equality of procedure rights for pastoralists and native title claimants, and I maintain that there cannot be such equality unless the nature of native title rights is recognised as unique and their interests different.</para><para>On this basis, I was able to secure what is in effect the right to negotiate under a state scheme. This requires notification of a proposed act—for example, mining—to native title holders and claimants; consultation, with a view to minimising any effect; mediation; and, in the event of disagreement, arbitration by an independent person or body. If favourable, that decision can be overturned only by the relevant minister after consultation with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and only in the public interest.</para><para>All of this is subject to judicial review to ensure procedures are properly and fairly carried out. Any compensation must be on just terms, decided by an independent tribunal. The state scheme requires the approval of the federal minister and that approval must gain the support of the Senate. If it does not, the federal right to negotiate will apply. Is Queensland—a Labor state—opposed to that? The Northern Territory scheme was tabled two days ago. I am having a very careful look at that. No doubt other senators are examining it as well. As far as I am concerned, it may well not meet with approval, but that must ultimately be a matter for our decision.</para><para>There were many other significant improvements to the legislation. I state quite unequivocally that I have continued to uphold both inside this place and out the protection of the 
 common law native title rights of indigenous Australians and have done so in a manner that will provide certainty and fairness to all concerned. I defy anybody to get up in here and say that I have not done that. This is one of the very few motions in this chamber relating to indigenous matters that I have not supported.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Margetts interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—For example, yesterday there was the reference of the Jabiluka matter to a committee.

I knew that that was no idle threat. The country would have been plunged into a blindly intolerant, hate filled and bitter race based election. I must say that that was not uppermost in my mind—I think you have to deal with all of these matters on their merits. At the time, the Chairman of ATSIC expressed his disappointment at the validation of extinguishment acts carried out from 1 July 1994 until the Wik decision in December 1996. Those acts were carried out by the Labor and National Queensland governments contrary to the Native Title Act. Labor voted in the Senate for the validation of those provisions.</para><para>Senator Bolkus has asked that these matters be referred to a committee.

I listened with great interest to what Senator Harradine has just had to say, particularly his comments about due process before the United Nations CERD looking at this matter. I take it as not only an implied criticism, but also a direct criticism of those persons from the Attorney-General's Department led by Mr Orr who appeared before the committee and defended the government and Australia's position.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously Senator Harradine has taken a greater interest in the deliberations of the committee than I perhaps did at the time. He noted that an inadequate job was done before the committee by Mr Orr and the other persons who attended on behalf of Australia. If that is true, it is yet another matter that has to be addressed in the Attorney-General's office, an office that is not holding itself in very high regard for delivering the responsibilities previously delivered by that portfolio to the people of Australia.</para><para>I will not delay the chamber, but I wish to make one further comment. I have just returned from overseas. I am not one who travels overseas at taxpayers' expense and takes the opportunity to bucket Australia or the deliberations of the parliaments of Australia. I feel that one should bite one's tongue when one is overseas representing one's 
 nation. It was very difficult to do so in Norway last week when, on two separate occasions, representatives of the Sami nation met and made representations to a parliamentary delegation from this parliament on Australia's indigenous people. We did bite our tongues. We did not take sides, bucket Australia or in any way denigrate Australia, and the whole delegation did that, not just me. We behaved impeccably, but it is difficult when one is overseas and these comments are thrown at one.</para><para>Part of the reason why these comments can be thrown at us is that we appear to have closed ranks on this issue. We are not open to deliberation or scrutiny. This was brought further to the fore last week when this chamber rejected a proposition that the CERD ought to be invited to come to Australia to see for itself just what the situation is here.</para><para>I was not here to take part in that vote, but what have we got to hide? After listening to Senator Harradine's impassioned speech, it would appear that we have got nothing to hide. If we have got nothing to hide, why are we hiding? Why are we going to reject this reference to a Senate committee for further scrutiny? I think that is probably what is going to happen in a very short time. Why are we doing that? I am baffled that the Senate of Australia should seek to do so, if indeed we are going to follow that course of action shortly.</para><para>If we do have something to hide, let's hide it, but if we have nothing to hide, let's open it up and refer this matter to a Senate committee. Let's invite all participants to put their views forward. Let's even go to the extent of inviting CERD to appear before the committee and see what views can be gleaned from them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4534</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to place on record the government's position on this. Senator Bolkus does not refer to CERD in his motion. He is referring to issues that have been dealt with at length by committees of this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>These matters, as Senator Harradine has said, have been dealt with at incredible 
 length. In fact, one of the debates was the longest debate on a single piece of legislation in Australian history. The debate on the two 1997 native title bills totalled 105 hours and 56 minutes. These matters were considered in detail and, as Senator Margetts said in her contribution, at length by the committees that looked into these bills just over a year ago. They were before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title for 53 days and 39 days in two different references. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked at these issues for a period of 39 days in 1997 and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title spent 53 days considering the legislation and these legal and constitutional issues. So, during the first term of the Howard government there were in excess of 90 days in committee.</para><para>I noted in some of the press over the last weekend that the government copped some flak for referring the so-called online bill. There was some disquiet because that bill, which is a relatively minor bill compared to a native title bill, was going to be referred to a committee for nine effective working days. I read a story in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> at the weekend to that effect.</para><para>It makes me laugh when I saw what happened in 1993 under the previous government on a piece of legislation as large, as complex, as overarching and as far-reaching as the Native Title Bill to now hear the Australian Labor Party saying that we need to refer just about everything off to a committee. In fact, more bills have been referred to more committees for longer in the last three years than in the history of Australia. For how long did Senator Bolkus and his mob want their Native Title Bill referred to a committee in 1993? How many days was that off at a committee? Seven working days. This is incredible, breathtaking hypocrisy from the mob opposite when it comes to committee references. These matters have spent in excess of 90 days in committee in the recent sittings of the parliament. That is the Labor Party's solution to native title. Senator Harradine has said to them, `Put your cards on the table. Come up with a policy.'</para><para>Probably very few people in Kalgoorlie, for example, read the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian Weekly</inline>. Most of them read the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie Miner</inline>. It might do Senator Bolkus good to read a paper like the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie Miner</inline> and see what the Australian Labor Party's equivocation on the native title issue is doing to the economy of a place like Kalgoorlie. I suggest to Senator Bolkus that he gets a subscription to the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie Miner</inline> and reads that, and puts his love and passion for a journal such as the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian Weekly</inline> to one side for a time.</para><para>Senator Harradine has challenged the Labor Party to put their amendments on the table, to say what they will do when they get back into power. That is what the people of Western Australia and, as Senator Harradine has said, Aboriginal people and other Australians would like. All we have got out of the Labor Party so far is, `We'll have a little powwow.' Mr Beazley's election policy was, `We'll have a meeting after the election and try to solve it.' That is not good enough for an opposition that purport to want to be a government at some stage in the next millennium. They should put their policies on the table. We are sick of their reliance on United Nations committees to run Australia. We think the Australian government, with the consent of the Australia parliament, should do that. This parliament has considered these matters at great length and, much to the ALP's chagrin, passed these laws. There has been a due process, a proper parliamentary process, and the law has passed through, as Senator Harradine has said, a gruelling process. The government will be opposing this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>4535</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pursuant to standing order 191, I claim to have been misunderstood by Senator McKiernan.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—You may make an explanation under that standing order, Senator Harradine.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Senator McKiernan suggested I was reflecting in some way on a very fine public servant, Mr Robert Orr, who represented Australia in CERD.

I am concerned that, by taking the position that Senator Harradine has taken, we are essentially taking a closed door approach to external scrutiny. If you are concerned about how the committee assessed Australia, then let us not be unfair to that UN committee. They want to come to Australia, but the government will not let them. If we set up a mechanism like the one I am proposing, then there is an opportunity for some of the questions and concerns that you have raised to be addressed. It does not do us any service to be cutting off this debate when the rest of the world is having it.

 has made a decision, but we in Australia will close our doors, the doors of the Senate and the government, to the views of that committee, and we hope the issue will go away.' As I said before, Senator Harradine, this issue will not go away. I think we are being unfair and not doing a service to either the convention or the committee by not at least allowing some degree of scrutiny.</para><para>Senator Harradine made a great point of saying that the committee had ignored what Australia said. The committee may have rejected what Australia said, but I do not think the transcript shows that the committee ignored what Australia said. The committee may not have noted what Australia said in its final decision, but if you look at the transcript of the committee's deliberations—the meeting of the committee where they heard the report from Ms McDougall, the country rapporteur—you will find 8½ pages of questions formulated by the rapporteur and put to Australia.

I will read what Mr Orr said:</para><para>Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power.</para><para>The RDA is important here because it incorporates the international covenant into Australian law. Mr Orr continued:</para><para>In summary, Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997 that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law position), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.</para><para>It does not mention the right to negotiate, which we must recognise was your mechanism in the bill. That is not recognised as a problem with CERD, although CERD found that it might have been. With regard to the three primary points that CERD was concerned about, the Australian government had its own legal advisers telling them that they would breach the RDA and CERD. Mr D.F. Jackson QC also gave the government advice, on 3 February 1997, that—and I quote:</para><para>. . . legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with 
 `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).</para><para>This government were quite aware, from the most eminent advice available to them, that they were breaching that convention.

The committee then went on to discuss special measures, read in accordance with the RDA. It said that the mechanisms for reading it in accordance with the RDA were the mechanisms adopted by the Labor government in the 1993 legislation, and that was to use the mechanism of special measures. The committee said, in respect of the 1993 act, that the act was consistent with the RDA; that it was consistent with CERD. It said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>It delicately balanced the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title-holders. The amended act, however, appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title-holders.</para><para>They recognised that the first act was consistent with the special measure mechanism in the convention, but they also made it very clear that the amended act was not; it very clearly was not. That is another instance where they took into account the evidence presented to them by the Australian delegation—evidence which, as I say, the Attorney-General was quite keen to reflect as constructive engagement with this committee.</para><para>You then say to me, `What about Labor's position?' Labor's position in 1993 was consistent with the RDA. Labor's position in 1997-98 was also a total wholesale alternative to what the government put up, and you know that full well. You know that, in putting up 
 that alternative, we were quite conscious of trying once again to get the balance right in order to avail ourselves of the mechanisms of CERD and the special measure mechanism. Although some elements of that alternative policy were obviously negative in terms of the impact on indigenous Australians, it was recognised by indigenous Australians as a special measure which could comply with the act. We know that as well. So it is chalk and cheese in terms of what this government has put up and our alternative at the time.</para><para>You ask what we will do in the future. There are already court cases on this legislation, but our attempt in the future will be to make a workable prescription. If you want workable prescriptions, you do not go to Kalgoorlie now because, despite what Senator Ian Campbell says, there are real concerns on the ground there with this government's legislation. The government rejected our alternative to fix up the Kalgoorlie problem.

I remind you, Senator Campbell, and Senator Harradine, that it was a committee of the United Nations that actually put together the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and we were at the forefront of that. They were the days when Australia used to engage constructively with the United Nations. They were the days when benchmark international mechanisms like this were developed. I would hazard a bet that, if we were now in the process of trying to develop a convention on the elimination of race discrimination, there would be one vacant spot at the table and that would be Australia's spot. This Prime Minister would not be party to such international human rights agenda setting. He would basically see it as political correctness. Senator Harradine, UN committees have jobs to do and they have done them extremely well. I put to you that you may have been a bit unfair with respect to this committee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will end on this particular point. Senator Harradine has raised concerns about Labor's position and about the committee's operation. I would like to be in a position to ask representatives of the Attorney-General: what did the Attorney-General mean in his press statements when he reflected the fact that Australia had a constructive engagement with the UN committee? We would like to get to that. We would then like to work out why, after the decision came out, he decided to shoot the messenger. We would like to find out what led to a change of legal position between that legal advice, the question time brief prepared by Mr Robert Orr on 17 November 1997 and the position put to CERD. There are directly fundamental inconsistencies and it is important for us to find out why the government had a change of view and why Mr Orr had a change of view. Did the Australian Government Solicitor have a change of view? Did they receive more advice through external briefings of QCs to see whether there was another point of view?</para><para>If you ain't got nothing to hide on this, then you set up a committee. Not only that, but there is an obligation on us, Senator 
 Harradine, to ensure that whatever dirty linen might be hanging out concerning this issue is revealed. You say you have advice from someone close to Aboriginal communities that reopening this may cause problems in outlying areas. Those problems will always be there unless we in this place are prepared to take an honest approach.</para><para>You will always have problems in this society given the diversity of it, not just problems with indigenous Australians but, from the migration intake that we have had, you will always have problems if one part of this community feels it has been discriminated against on the basis of race. You know that, Senator Harradine, because for all of your public life in this place one of your fundamental benchmarks has been the UN convention. We have respected you for that. As immigration minister I had to cop the heat of it, but at all times I respected what was driving you. In this particular instance, you would be letting down that convention, the international mechanism to enforce it and also what well-meaning people in this society want to do if you reject the opportunity for us to scrutinise the government's actions.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:41:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

 industry of approximately $2.3 million per annum. I acknowledge they are not your figures, Minister Kemp; they are figures that the sugar industry provided in evidence before the select committee. But the amendments went way beyond the sugar industry. There were a range of issues relating to financial institutions, insurance, bad debts, nursing homes, farm land and other significant matters.

One of the amendments relates to the issue of gambling, and perhaps it is useful for me to make some comments on this in the light of some of the press articles this morning. The government's policy in relation to gambling was set out in the taxation package which was released in August last year. What was said there was that the GST will apply to the operator's margin, not the prizes paid out. That is, the tax will apply to the difference between the total ticket sales and bets taken and the value of prizes or winnings paid out. As states already tax gambling highly, there may need to be corresponding reductions in state gambling taxes. The taxation package allowed for the entire proceeds of the goods and services tax from gambling to be paid over to the states, and the recently signed Commonwealth-state agreement provides compensation for the states for GST on gambling so the states' gambling taxes will be reduced in the same amount.</para></talk.start><para>The GST bill introduced on 2 December last year sought to give effect to this policy by adopting a global accounting system for gambling supplies in which tax was payable on total amounts wagered less total monetary prizes, that is, the player's loss. However, the current definition did not fully take into account all payments that the casino operator must pay and therefore incorrectly states the player loss and the casino profit. A common practice in the industry is to provide a rebate to some gamblers on their total losses. The rebate has the effect of reducing the casino margin. The amendment ensures that such rebates are included in the calculation of 
 player loss and casino margin. This is not a concession, as was reported, but merely gives effect to the original policy so that the operator's true margin is subject to tax. The approach is entirely consistent with the states' approach to the taxation of gambling, where a reduced rate is applied to the commission based play.</para><para>Another example of an amendment that the government is making to ensure that the net revenue from gambling does not change is the government's proposals to make GST free certain raffles and bingo activities. These are not currently subject to state taxes, and the only practical way to give effect to the government's policy of no net gambling tax change is to exclude them from the GST.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>4542</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is an extraordinary intervention by the minister.

He proceeded to do that and opened up the issue. If we were proceeding with this in an orderly manner, when we came to the amendments that the government has tabled on this issue we ought to, as Senator Murray has rightly observed, deal with this issue then.

We think those amendments are favouritism to the high roller mates of the Liberal Party. We think those amendments do bias the system unfairly. We do not see a basis at all for giving casinos a break which is not extended to other areas of the community in a like manner. We do not see particularly that the casinos are a deserving group in Australian society when we have had so many other organisations that I think have made a very compelling case to the inquiry

We are talking here about the ultra rich that fly into airports in their private jets and then wander down in their chauffeured limousines to the Crown Casino, or whatever it is, and move straight into the mahogany room to risk in gambling half a million dollars or more a throw—as the paper said today, up to $5 million dollars a throw—and we are talking about the government giving a concession to casinos for that class of player.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—It is obscene.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I take that objection about it being obscene.

 public storm of protest about the priorities and principles of this government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I happen to think that a prudent government, faced with this public outcry, would do the sensible thing and quietly over the weekend just pull those amendments out of the pack and forget about proceeding with them. If you had any sense, that is what you would do, not that I am in the position of advising a government—far from it. But if I were to, I would suggest that is what you ought to do: over the weekend quietly forget the matter—bury it—and get on with the other issues of the GST.</para><para>But I suspect you will not because the intricate web of the connections of influence between the Liberal Party, particularly in Victoria, and casino ownership is so intense and so important to the functioning of that operation that you cannot forget it and cannot do the sensible thing, that you are captive here and you are obliged to proceed. I suspect that is the truth. I hope you prove me wrong, and if you do I will be the first to acknowledge that you have done the sensible and prudent thing. But I suspect I am right and that you will proceed to press these amendments.</para><para>There is nothing in the explanation that has been provided today that should cause anyone that is offended by this manifestation of naked greed to be mollified in any way. There is nothing in what has been said by you, Minister, today that would cause anyone to think the government is moderating its position. In fact, there is every reason—taking the explanation that you have made—to presume that the government is digging in. That is the reason you made the explanation in the first place. You made the explanation because you wanted to try and defend the government's position. You wanted to try—utilising this phase of the debate—to step forward and quietly, just before lunchtime on Thursday, make an official explanation and hope the whole thing might therefore serve as a press release to be run round the gallery and counter the outrage that is being expressed by community and church leaders around Australia. </para><para>I do not think this occasion can go past in this chamber with us allowing that type of `sneak the explanation through'. We are bound to stand, to mark the spot and to now say: when these amendments come forward, if you are foolhardy enough to persist with them, the Australian Labor Party will defeat them. The basic argument in this debate on a GST has boiled down to an argument about fairness. And that is a good argument to have. One of the things that is basic to the ethic of Australia, to the egalitarian nature of our own society, to the idea of a fair go for everyone is let's do it fairly, let's treat everyone reasonably and let's give everyone a break.</para><para>The GST is a percentage tax that applies equally to everyone irrespective of income and it takes a bigger slice of the income of the poor than it does of the wealthy. It is a regressive tax. The debate is about how you make that fair. Our submission in this debate is that you cannot. The very nature of the tax makes it unfair and the compensation you might award to try to overcome the unfairness for those on middle and low incomes in this nation will be compensation delivered up-front now, if it is, but future governments will knock it off, change it or erode it and the tax will remain forever but the compensation will fade away. The unfairness will, as the years tick by, get more and more gross. That is what this debate is now about.</para><para>On top of this debate, as we are talking about how gross it will get and the options to lock in fairness, comes the story in this morning's press about the casinos and how the high rollers, the international billionaires who gamble in the exclusive rooms of the major casinos in Australia, are to be assisted by having some of their losses handed back to them and the handing back of their losses, because of the size of their losses, is a tax deduction for the casinos. We are talking here about capturing the international casino trade and the way we do it apparently in this country is that, when a higher roller has bet and lost a million dollars, we hand some of their losses back to them. We then say, `That is free of the GST.' And we say, under your amendment, `This is fair.' Tell that to the rest of the patrons of the casino.</para><para>I am not a patron of a casino, but I respect the right of people to gamble if they want to. I deplore where it is done in excess, but I am not opposed to the principle of gambling at all. But it is not fair for the rest of the patrons and as sure as hell it ain't fair for the rest of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4545</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am at a bit of a loss.

As you know, I took a point of order to say that perhaps we should delay the debate until later, but since the minister has raised the matter and since it is an issue of immediate importance I think I should add a few remarks to what has been said already.</para></talk.start><para>My first remark refers to the different roles of the select committee, the Senate and the government. The select committee received confidential submissions on this matter. The select committee did not take evidence in camera from the witness concerned, and I am concerned about the possibility that the confidential submissions to the committee have gone to the government to influence their amendment. Perhaps later on in the debate the minister could indicate whether the source for the government's gambling amendments was separate or different from confidential submissions to the Senate select committee, because there would be a matter of privilege attached to that, and that is an important issue.</para><para>The second issue that I wish to draw to the minister's attention, and on which perhaps he can take advice and advise us in the debate, is the sequential nature of transactions which are being discussed—namely, that a bet is placed and subsequently a rebate is provided. To my mind, in the law with which we are dealing, those constitute two separate transactions of a service and would be separately subject to a GST. I would like to draw your attention to that too.</para><para>The third area is an area of priority in policy and very much goes to the nub of what Senator Cook was saying. It is that inbound tourists have been refused GST free status as exports. Inbound tourists happen to be ordinary people, mostly. They are honeymoon couples coming to Australia, they are mums and dads visiting their children, they are friends of business people here, and they are ordinary tourists wanting to enjoy Australia. As an export industry, the legitimate claim for GST free status has been ignored by the government, and yet the government has been very rapidly responsive to a different class of tourist—the rich, the elite, the high rollers, who patronise a few very large establishments 
 with which the coalition has intimate relationships. You need to dust off your reasons and explain to the Senate why you would treat the mums, dads, friends, honeymoon couples and business visitors coming in on inbound tourism packages entirely differently from high rollers. I make those points briefly in response to the remarks made so far.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>4546</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the minister has opened this debate now—I thought we would be having it a little later when we got to the government amendments—I need to move on from some of those questions that Senator Murray has asked that I hope the minister will be able to answer for us today. Are you just talking about high rollers, and do you expect that these people will be, overwhelmingly, tourists? If the answers are yes and yes, then I have to ask why it is that you are concerned about jobs in casinos but not about the myriad of jobs in the tourism industry—the jobs on charter jobs, in hotels, restaurants, et cetera. Why is it that we seem to be narrowing in on one particular group of jobs and ignoring all those other tourism jobs?</para></talk.start><para>As we well know, there are only two export industries that have not been covered in your tax package, and the one that stands out the most is the tourist industry. This package was supposedly designed with a view to supporting exports, and yet one of our most successful export industries—the tourism industry—has been ignored. Whereas other countries offer a range of different incentives for tourism, here there are none—until now. We now have some incentives for one particular group of tourists to travel to Australia. As my colleague Senator Murray said, the government's attitude is, `Forget about the families and forget about the honeymoon couples. We want the high rollers.' If the minister is not prepared to answer these questions today, we certainly need them to be taken on notice. When we get back to this debate, I think the fundamental questions will be: why are some tourists now going to be preferred over others, and why are some jobs going to be preferred over others?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—I remind the Senate that the question of relevance seems to have just lately departed a little.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>4546</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister raised this issue, and no-one called him to relevance.

At a time like this, it is necessary to set aside differences and focus upon those who are most in need. Australia is a wealthy, mature, culturally diverse nation, and it is imperative that we act as such, without reservations and with altruism foremost in our minds. Therefore, for the record, I reaffirm the opposition's in principle support for this legislation, designed to provide 
 assistance to some 4,000 displaced refugees from Kosovo should the need arise to accommodate them in Australia.</para><para>Having set on the record our support for this stance, I want to emphasise to the government that it now has a great responsibility to look after these refugees not only if they arrive on our shores, but also if it is decided it is best for them to stay close to their homeland. It is clear from the government's actions that, while its intent was good, many of the decisions taken were reactive and, ultimately, possibly detrimental to the cause of these refugees. The pause in the humanitarian operation initiated by the UNHCR has given the government a second chance to iron out all the problems with its operation and, most importantly, it now has the time to clearly think about the consequences of its decisions.</para><para>There are several areas that could and should be improved upon with regard to Australia's response to this humanitarian crisis. The opposition is still of the opinion that the government's efforts have not gone far enough and are still too reactive given the pace at which this crisis continues to grow and given that this human tragedy is spilling over to neighbouring nations. It is important that the government keeps an open mind to new developments and that the focus is maintained in the best interests of the refugees. In this instance, the eyes of the world are upon us and Australia has an enviable record when it comes to assisting those who are less fortunate. We must make sure that we build on that reputation and that our wealth and resources are shared for causes such as this.</para><para>As part of keeping an open mind to the needs of the refugees, the opposition calls on the government to consider an expansion of the permanent humanitarian program to cater for the Kosovo refugees. Temporary residence may not be the appropriate answer to cater for these poor people, especially if the conflict escalates and ground troops are used. Should this happen, the likelihood of a protracted conflict in the region will increase and the need for a more permanent solution for 
 refugee accommodation will certainly be required.</para><para>While, on the surface, it may seem that we are facilitating the work of Slobodan Milosevic by providing a permanent safe haven for those he is trying to remove from Kosovo, in reality there will be many refugees who will not be able to return to their homeland even after the end of hostilities. Some will have nothing and no-one to go back to, some may face persecution if they return and some will have developed ties to and within Australia after many months here and may feel settled and secure in our country.</para><para>Already, the UNHCR has begun to reassemble family units among the Kosovo refugees. This is a sad and unforgiving task, but it aims to bring some normality back into the lives of thousands of people who, until now, have not only tried to survive but have also been burdened with the thought of never seeing their families and loved ones again. These are the sorts of people who require our help and compassion. The government will have to consider the wisdom of sending them back against their wishes once the conflict is over, whenever that may be. While the answers are not easy, what we clearly say is that an open mind and an open heart must be kept.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party when in government understood this situation and in 1995 decided to expand its humanitarian intake by borrowing from forward programs to cater for the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was a good decision. Those who came over under this scheme have now become productive members of our community and they are proud to call Australia their new home.</para><para>The opposition has examined the bill that is before the Senate today. We note the intent of the government to safeguard the integrity of the migration program by providing broad discretionary powers to the minister. These powers are designed to ensure that those refugees accepted in Australia comply with all character and criminal checks. These provisions are desirable as we must ensure that those people that we choose to accept are the needy and those looking for a safe haven from the tragedies of war.</para><para>We also note that the bill quite clearly prevents the refugees from applying for any other form of protection visa while holding a temporary safe haven visa. The opposition has always held reservations in cases such as these where opportunities for individual choice are restricted. We note, however, that the bill contains provisions for the minister to effectively override these considerations and allow a person or group of people to apply for different protection visa classes should their circumstances warrant it.</para><para>The opposition asks the minister to use these broad discretionary powers with wisdom and generosity, keeping in mind that these refugees' first choice would have been to remain in their country and continue to lead peaceful and productive lives. Their decision to seek asylum in Australia, if they choose to do so, should be interpreted by the minister as an act of desperation and a wish to rebuild a new life.</para><para>Another aspect of this legislation that concerns the opposition is the inclusion of a six-month sunset clause on the safe haven visas. Again, I note the intent of the government to safeguard our migration program. However, if the situation in Kosovo deteriorates further, this six-month sunset clause will prove unrealistic and Australia may well breach international conventions on the rights of refugees.</para><para>To ensure that this situation does not eventuate, the opposition calls on the minister to exercise his powers without delay following the expiry of the sunset clause should the hostilities not be resolved. At that stage, the government will need to realise that a permanent solution to the fate of the 4,000 refugees is required and that all avenues of appeal and asylum determination must then be opened for these people.</para><para>Under our international obligations and our moral obligations as a responsible nation, we are bound to ensure the safety of these refugees and we must not cause unnecessary trauma and anxiety in these people's minds about their fate. In the event that our assistance in accommodating these refugees is no longer required or that alternative arrangements are reached by the UNHCR in the 
 meantime, the question will then arise as to what to do in terms of Australia's aid effort. Currently, the monetary element to which the government has committed itself is $6 million. This figure, given the recent developments and the gravity of the situation, seems more and more inappropriate as each day goes by.</para><para>The government needs to realise that this is no longer a game of numbers and figures but is a serious attempt to alleviate a crisis of global proportions. In the event of the UNHCR no longer requiring our logistical assistance in relocating the refugees, the opposition calls on the government not to rescind its offer of assistance and to donate to humanitarian agencies the total worth of the aid package as Australia's contribution to solving the Kosovo crisis.</para><para>While there are no figures attached to this resolution, it is expected that it might comprise the overall costs that would have been associated with relocating, housing, feeding and supporting the 4,000 refugees while in Australia. The final figure may, of course, run into many millions of dollars but, given the circumstances of this tragedy and the alternatives in terms of loss of human life and what is essentially the displacement of a whole nation, we say that it is the least a country like Australia can provide in assistance. It is with those considerations and issues in mind that the opposition gives its support to the passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>4553</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate is considering the <inline ref="s214">Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999</inline>  brought forward by the government to enable them to offer temporary safe haven visas at this stage to people who have been displaced from Kosovo as part of the current escalation of conflict in that region and applies specifically to those who have been displaced since the US-NATO bombing campaign started. It is unfortunate that we have a specifically limited time frame to debate this legislation—we have until only 2 o'clock—because it is very important. It is self-evident that it deals with a matter of extreme interest to the Australian community and on which many people in the 
 community have quite strong opinions and have a great deal of interest in seeing significant assistance being provided to refugees in the Balkans at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed, it is probably not unreasonable to suggest that it is because of that great degree of concern within the Australian community that the government came forward with this initiative to offer 4,000 temporary places. So it is a shame that we do not have time to go into as much detail of the bill as would be desirable. If we do run short of time, I would hope that the government and, I am sure, the Democrats would be quite happy to use an hour of Senate time tomorrow, setting aside the tax debate for a little while, to deal with this issue. I notice there are a number of speakers on the speakers list.</para><para>The bill is important not just because people are interested in helping refugees in Kosovo; it is equally important because of its content. The bill has some potentially very far-reaching measures. It is easy to dress it up and say that this is just the government on behalf of the Australian people offering a helping hand to people in need. I am sure that is partly the government's intent, but the bill has some very significant potential ramifications. Indeed, the whole concept of offering only temporary assistance to refugees in itself has potentially significant ramifications for long-term refugee policy in Australia. That being the case, it is very dangerous for the Senate to just wave it through as a goodwill measure on the part of the government. There are a lot of potentially very serious, very significant and long-term ramifications from proceeding down this path.</para><para>The view of the Democrats is that this bill is unnecessary. There is no need to have special legislation for Australia to offer assistance to refugees from Kosovo. We can offer assistance today by providing permanent places in Australia. Indeed, the government has provided permanent places for 200 refugee families, as it announced last week, and the Democrats welcome that. The big problem with that is that it is not 200 extra places as part of our refugee humanitarian program; it is 200 places specifically earmarked for Kosovo refugees out of the existing program 
 which means that 200 other families elsewhere in the world will now miss out. The Democrats believe it is essential that the overall size of our refugee and humanitarian intake program be expanded as part of the things that need to be done to assist with this current crisis.</para><para>I did have a second reading amendment circulated seeking to have a Senate vote establishing that principle. However, because of the government's inability to get this legislation brought on during normal debate in the Senate, and because we have to debate it in what is euphemistically called the `non-controversial legislation' lunchtime debate where we are not able to call a division on anything in the bill, I indicate to the Senate that I will not proceed with that second reading amendment because I think it is important enough to call a division on. I will do it by way of notice of motion or some other mechanism in the not too distant future, and as an indication of the Democrats' willingness to be cooperative about this matter, despite our very serious and significant concerns about some of the shortcomings of the bill.</para><para>Senator Faulkner indicated at the start of his contribution that it is important for us as a nation to focus on those most in need and with altruism foremost in our mind. I certainly agree with those words. That being so, we need to look at how best to address that need. It is the view of the Democrats that this bill is clearly not the best way. The best way to help these refugees is to provide extra funding and technical assistance where they are now. Again, I acknowledge the commitment that the government has made to date of $6 million in that regard. That is one way. The other is to provide genuine, permanent refugee places under Australia's program as it already exists. As I have already said, this should be by way of increasing the size of the program.</para><para>Offering temporary haven to these people, as Senator Faulkner pointed out, has a number of dangers which may well lead to increasing the trauma they have suffered. People who work with refugees know that one of the traumas for refugees is the event that forced 
 them out of their homes. That is a very traumatic immediate event. The other major traumas that refugees and refugee families suffer are the ongoing sense of displacement, the ongoing uncertainty about their future, the ongoing loss of control about where they can call home and what is going to become of them.</para><para>There is a danger with the temporary haven approach that we will be exacerbating that trauma, that we will have people here for an indeterminate length of time with no control over their future. Obviously they will be able to return whenever they want, but they will have very little or no control over how long they can stay. They will be completely at the mercy of the government and the minister as to how long they can stay here, and they will be unable to apply for a humanitarian visa or any other visa while they are here. There is a small exception to that in the legislation but, as the minister's second reading speech pointed out, the minister will only allow an exemption to that policy under exceptional circumstances—that does not exactly give great cause for hope that he will exercise that discretion in a large number of cases. We have the problem that offering temporary haven may well exacerbate the uncertainty that these refugee people have over their future.</para><para>It is misleading to use the label `refugee' in the context of this legislation because the main purpose of this bill is to prevent people from claiming refugee status. The 4,000 people who come here through utilising the power established via this legislation will specifically be prevented from claiming refugee status. They will basically be saying, `We are not refugees' or `If we are refugees, we are not going to claim it in Australia.' To claim refugee status, they will need to go offshore and be part of the queue for a not very sizeable number of spaces. Indeed, some of the problems with offering temporary asylum were well outlined by Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer before the Prime Minister's backflip on this issue earlier in the month. Other refugee organisations, and Amnesty International, have highlighted these problems. I emphasise that those problems are 
 just with the general concept of offering temporary safe haven.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> from the parliamentary library deals with some of these and it briefly highlights, by way of general comment, some of the difficulties that may arise in relation to this legislation and the dangers involved in not meeting the crucial principle of the non-refoulement of people, which basically means not returning refugees to a place where they are still in danger. If there is a very clear potential conflict the bill in itself does not mean that that will happen. It does not automatically mean that refugees or what would otherwise be refugees—the holders of safe haven visas—will be sent back against their will, but it gives the minister the power to do that.</para><para>It is all very nice to have commitments saying, `We will not do that, we will call on the government not to do that,' but it gives the minister the power to do that. Again, it leaves the future of these refugees very much in the hands of the minister. For all the exhortations one might make about the humanitarian approach of the minister—broadly speaking, I would not demur from those—he is not the only person in the government. I am sorry to say that, as much as I would like to have goodwill in relation to an issue such as this, I think it is very difficult to believe that all people in the government are motivated completely by humanitarian concerns in the treatment of refugee issues.</para><para>I refer the Senate to an article by Richard McGregor in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 13 April which specifically deals with the government's reversal on the Kosovo refugees and going down this new route of offering temporary humanitarian assistance. It also deals with the fact that this approach of the government does not signal a softening on refugee issues. Indeed, the article highlights that our immigration policy is getting tougher, particularly for refugees. The approach of the government on refugee issues broadly is not one that makes one feel that humanitarian concerns are always at the top of the list. Passing a piece of legislation which empowers the minister to ignore humanitarian concerns is something 
 that needs to be highlighted and it needs to be recognised that that is what we are doing.</para><para>I also point to <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> No. 7 of this month which draws the attention of senators to provisions in the bill which may be considered to `trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties and make those rights unduly dependent on nonreviewable decisions.' Because this is a specific, deliberate policy decision of the government, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did not see it as appropriate to comment further on that. It is important to emphasise that that is what this bill does. This bill offers temporary safe haven. Inasmuch as it may provide some relief from immediate suffering, the Democrats welcome that. We reiterate that to do that it is not necessary to pass this bill. We can bring people in immediately under our existing refugee program.</para><para>It is important again to emphasise what else is actually being done as part of this bill in establishing this temporary safe haven. The minister can reduce the length of temporary safe haven visas without appeal, solely on the grounds that he believes temporary safe haven is no longer necessary. There are no criteria he needs to measure in relation to that. He does not specifically have to address the principle of non-refoulement. I note that Senator Margetts has an amendment in the committee stage which goes part of the way to redressing that in terms of requiring the minister to ensure that there has been a significant change of circumstances indicating that the country is more stable and that the changes are durable and fundamental. That is welcomed, but there is a lot more to refugees and dangers in returning home than simply being able to say, `Well, the war has stopped, so off you go.'</para><para>I think the World Vision report that my colleague Senator Stott Despoja tabled just previously highlights that there are a lot of very personal and very traumatic experiences that people endure. That World Vision report particularly highlights women and children. There is a lot in terms of a place not being safe to return to on an individual level and personal level that may have very little to do with whether or not the war has actually 
 stopped. So it is a fundamental issue. This legislation empowers the minister to send people back to somewhere where they believe they are not safe and it seeks to enable him to do that without any appeal.</para><para>Holders of these visas, as I have already said, cannot apply for refugee status. They cannot apply for any other visa without going offshore. The minister can cancel the visa without regard to natural justice—it is specifically in the legislation. And that decision is not appealable or reviewable—or the legislation seeks to enable that to be the case. A decision by the minister to shorten or extend a visa is not reviewable. He has no duty to consider any request for a visa extension due to personal circumstances. Again, he may, but he does not have to. Obviously, political issues can come into play here.</para><para>The minister can cancel or refuse to grant a visa on character grounds without appeal, without notice, without natural justice. The assessment of what makes someone's character undesirable can include something as general as past  and present general conduct, that their presence may prejudice Australia's international relations or that they have been sentenced to 12 months gaol or more. The definition of gaol includes residential drug rehab or residential programs for the mentally ill. I know a number of these are similar to existing legislation, but remember that we are talking about refugees here. This enables the minister to cancel the visa solely on those grounds. Perhaps even more dramatically, if a person has their visa cancelled on character grounds, this automatically extends to each immediate family member without even any requirement for notice to have been given. The whole family is immediately able to have their visas cancelled without review and without notice. I think it is important to emphasise that those powers are being put in there.</para><para>One of the significant objectives of this bill is to create a class of visa holders who can be removed easily with minimum cost and with no regard for the opportunity for appeal. The legislation seeks to do this by insulating the minister from the fetters of the rule of law when making certain decisions concerning the 
 granting and termination of the class of visa and granting him more power to cancel visas of those he considers undesirable. It is debatable whether or not this objective will be achievable. It is quite possible that visa holders may still be able to bring writs or injunctions in the High Court, despite this government's  ongoing attempts to restrict the ability of people—refugees and other migrants—to appeal to the courts. They have found it a bit difficult to date to stop people being able to go to the High Court because of the awkward and annoying thing of the Australian Constitution. It will be interesting to see whether or not that may still apply in relation to this bill.</para><para>The issue of refugees which this bill relates to is something that I think is of great significance if we are to take human rights seriously. As a nation we have had an unfortunate debate in the last couple of years when we have really had to question whether or not as a nation we are welcoming towards refugees any more—whether we are welcoming towards migrants. I do want to express my pleasure, my gratitude to the large proportion of the Australian community who have indicated that we are a generous nation, that we do want to help people in need. And I hope we can recognise that and hold on to it so that that does not just dissipate as this crisis slips off the front pages. I hope it is an ongoing commitment to assisting people in need and it does not just apply to white Europeans but we have a similar level of concern for people in Asia, for people in sub-Saharan Africa or elsewhere.</para><para>There are a number of other issues I would like to go into which I do not have time to because of circumstances. There are some significant issues in terms of the United Nations protocols and conclusions on international protection and refugee status that I think allow the government to basically ignore those international conventions. That is a matter of great concern to the Democrats. I hope to have the opportunity to ask for some clarification by the government on some of those issues in the committee stage of the debate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>4557</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 6 April 1999 the government committed to accept 4,000 Kosovar refugees. The provisions of the <inline ref="s214">Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999</inline>  allow for a visa class to be known as class UJ, temporary safe haven visa. These visas will be temporary only. A holder will not be able to apply for another visa class unless the minister grants permission to do so in the public interest. The minister's decision to allow a person to make or not to make an application for another type of visa will not be judicially reviewable. The minister will decide when the visas are no longer valid. The decision will not be judicially reviewable.</para></talk.start><para>The power to remove persons once a visa is deemed no longer valid will be given to the department. The minister will also have the power to refuse to grant or to cancel a person's temporary safe haven visa based on character grounds. This decision will apply to each member of the immediate family of the person and will not be reviewable. So, no matter what the implications for each of the members of that family, it will not be reviewable.</para><para>I would like to congratulate the government, however, on their efforts so far on several counts. The minister has responded swiftly to the call from UNHCR to offer to take refugees from the Kosovo crisis. Also, there has been a high level assessment team sent to Macedonia to assist with preparations for the possible evacuation of Kosovar refugees to Australia. The government are to be congratulated that the legislation has been presented to the parliament for debate so swiftly such that the conditions and safeguards will be in place before refugees arrive, if they do arrive. The government are to be congratulated that the act and regulations would minimise administrative tasks to be undertaken by the refugees. There would be no need to fill in forms for the initial application or for the renewal of visas. This may sound like an insignificant detail, but for a refugee the fewer bureaucratic requirements they have to fulfil the better. We know that the situation many of the refugees find themselves in is that they currently have no docu 
 ments with them. Their documents have been removed, so it would be very difficult for them to fill in the normal kinds of application forms that would be required for haven in Australia.</para><para>The Greens (WA) do have several concerns. As the bill stands, the minister and the minister alone has the power to decide when the Kosovar refugees will be made to return home. It is not a sufficiently accountable mechanism that the return of persons to Kosovo be contingent upon whether or not in the minister's opinion temporary safe haven in Australia is no longer necessary. That is from schedule 1 of the bill. The government has expressed its concern that these people, who have left their homes in traumatic circumstances, be provided with a safe and stable retreat where they will be protected from further exposure to traumatic events and will therefore be able to continue their lives with minimal further disruption. This, of course, is a very laudable aim, and one that government and non-government organisations are working hard towards.</para><para>It is one thing, however, to create stability through physical surroundings and another thing to create stability through the psychological certainty of knowing that you will not be sent home before enduring stable conditions have returned to your country, or perhaps even your part of the country. To safeguard against this happening, greater transparency and objective ability to verify need to be built into the decision of the minister. To this end, I will be moving an amendment that the minister be required to present a case that his or her decision meets various criteria as outlined in conclusion 69 of the executive committee of the UNHCR.</para><para>The Greens (WA) are also concerned that the minister's decision to extend or shorten the visa term will not be reviewable. I am not at all comfortable with this provision, but I understand that the government wishes to make the process of managing the Kosovar refugees in Australia as expeditious as possible. We all know that reviews can take time. It is intended in any case that the introduction of greater accountability in the minister's decision will minimise any need for a review. 
 I hope, therefore, that I will receive support in amending the minister's accountability requirements.</para><para>Whilst I congratulate the government for offering help to Kosovar refugees, I hope that the provision of temporary protection will not become a trend. These people are refugees; that is demonstrably and palpably so. Under the refugee convention they have a right to permanent protection, and Australia accepts this standard in domestic law, that is, permanent protection if they so seek it. With such massive, sudden movements of refugees, it should be possible that Australia increase its humanitarian quota to respond in a way that is compassionate and that conforms to international law, that is, in a way that offers permanent resettlement and its consequent rights and privileges. It is a pity that we are restricted in the way we can deal with amendments in this lunchtime debate, because I would certainly be supportive of Senator Bartlett's amendment to that end.</para><para>It is pertinent to take note, in respect of the points I have mentioned, that Canada will not be enacting legislation for the Kosovar refugees that it accepts. This is simply because Canada has found that temporary protection for refugees is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada's alternative to temporary status has been to offer visitor visas to Kosovar refugees, giving them the freedom to subsequently apply for permanent residency through the normal refugee application process. This may not be the appropriate response for the Australian government, but it does highlight the fact that temporary protection for refugees is not ideal human rights practice. The high commissioner has asked Australia to take Kosovar refugees on a temporary basis only, and this bears on the situation. I also recognise that some latitude has been given to the minister to allow certain persons, in the public interest, to apply for permanent protection. I do not think this goes far enough, however, and we will be moving an amendment to broaden the person's ability to apply to stay permanently and to be treated on a case basis. In any case, I would certainly hate to think that with the passing of this bill the government considered 
 that it had some degree of mandate for treating future refugees on a similar temporary basis. I hope I am not pre-empting things here, but a prime example that springs to mind is that of the East Timorese people.</para><para>I realise that this whole debate is hypothetical to some extent. If it becomes apparent that Australia's assistance will not be needed to care for Kosovar refugees in Australia, I would welcome any commitment by the government that the money be allocated instead to the aid efforts in Kosovo itself. In that, I would agree with Senator Faulkner's proposal for the transfer of those funds. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continues to remind governments that assistance to rebuild Kosovo is going to extend far beyond the disappearance of news from the headlines. If money can be found to assist Kosovar refugees onshore, then this money can be earmarked for contributing to long-term rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. I urge the government to provide a commitment to do this.</para><para>The issue of refugees from Kosovo is obviously a very real issue for many people. We have seen the pictures nightly on our television screens and in our newspapers and have read the very traumatic stories. We realise that the issue of the future of Kosovo is going to be very complex and very traumatic for all people concerned. The opinion has been expressed by a number of people that it is important, where possible, that the refugees stay close to Kosovo. Many of the refugees, where they have been interviewed, have indicated that they would like to stay close to Kosovo and that they would not like to cut their ties with Kosovo. In many instances I guess the process of choosing the 4,000 potential refugees in Australia would likely relate to whether or not those people feel that they have some interest in making that move—temporarily at least—or whether they might have families, connections or some interest in Australia.</para><para>I would like to think that the concept of the visibility of the problem in Kosovo should be uppermost in many people's minds and that we will not be part of a process to take the problem out of sight and out of mind. How 
 ever, given that the offer is there, if there are 4,000 people who choose to come to Australia and if the UNHCR suggests that this is the right and proper thing to do at that time, I would urge the government to treat those people as proper refugees. I would urge the government to enable the people from within those 4,000 to be able to argue their case if they know and they can prove that their circumstances will mean that, even if it might be safe for a broad category of refugees to return, it will be unsafe for them to return.</para><para>We know the kinds of circumstances that have occurred because we have seen them on our television screens. We know that the individual circumstances or the circumstances of villages or of other parts of that country are very traumatic. We know that if it is possible to solve the broad political problems, and my feelings are that there are probably broad political, historical and economic problems to deal with in an open way—going back to the source of the problems, dealing with them, trying to make peace and trying to deal with the resolution of conflict—there will still be problems within those countries which put people's lives at constant risk. I would like to think that people will not be forced to leave their temporary haven in Australia, and go back to where their lives will continue to be at risk as a result of that, simply because they are in a broad category and cannot be looked at according to their own circumstances as legitimate refugees.</para><para>I know that on many occasions in the past Senator Harradine has been very strong on these issues and I am not even in a position to know whether Senator Harradine has had a chance to see the proposals for my first or second amendments. I know that the government has indicated that it is not prepared to support the second amendment at this stage, but I would like to think that there is still a chance of getting approval on the second amendment and I would urge support from honourable senators on the issue of being able to deal with people by treating their cases on their merits without putting them at undue risk simply because they are in a category of 4,000. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>4560</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin, as other speakers have begun so far, by saying that, as I understand it, everybody in the chamber agrees with the government's intention of helping people from Kosovo and that the government is to be congratulated on that. I also acknowledge the work that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has done. He is a man with whom I have sat on committees over the years and who is clearly a person of compassion. So, as Senator Faulkner said on behalf of the opposition, we are behind the government's intentions to relieve the situation amongst the people fleeing from Kosovo—and that, I think, is a proper way to begin this speech. Senator Faulkner went on to say that the opposition has some problems with the legislation in its current terms, Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Democrats, said the same thing and Senator Margetts has some problems with the legislation which should be looked at.</para></talk.start><para>The  Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  has been brought on at a time when non-controversial legislation is normally brought on. I am not sure that gives the right significance to this legislation. This is legislation that should be debated at length. We are presently debating the GST, which is of course vital legislation and which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, would understand in all its ramifications more than most people not only here but generally, so you understand the importance of the debate about the goods and services tax and the new tax system. That deals with issues of money—how much money is going to be paid out and who is going to get that money; all very important stuff—but this legislation deals with people's lives, their futures and their ability to get away from an absolutely dreadful situation. I see Senator Schacht here. He will be speaking later on and I think he will say things about that. Senator Stott Despoja has told us of her experiences.</para><para>The message coming back is that this is a fearful and dreadful situation, a real horror in the true sense of the word. To debate this issue in the short term that is proposed seems 
 to, as I say, signify an importance or a weight that is insufficient. Certainly more time should be made available to debate these issues, and soon, because this is urgent legislation.</para><para>But even at a technical level there are some great issues raised by this bill. It anticipates in many ways a debate we are going to have later on about the extent to which there ought to be quality control exercised by the courts over the administration of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This bill seeks to send the way in which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is administered back to the pre-Senator Ray days, if I can put it that way.</para><para>In the eighties—as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—the decision as to who did or did not come to Australia was left very much up to the minister. During the time that Senator Ray was minister, he began the process of saying, `There ought to be standards, there ought to be criteria, according to which people can come to Australia. If they meet that criteria they can come. If they do not meet that criteria they cannot come.'</para><para>People could see the criteria, could see the basis upon which decisions were made, could see that basis upon which people were brought here, could see the basis upon which people were refused. That made the whole system much better and much more open. It took a lot of pressure off the minister, who would otherwise have had to make the decision. I think that things worked very well.</para><para>There has been a tendency to go back to that system where the minister makes the decisions. If you look at this piece of legislation, there are clauses in it which clearly demonstrate what I am saying. I will go through them. In schedule 1 of the bill—in fact, there is only one schedule to this bill, as I remember it—proposed section 37A(5) says:</para><para>(5)	 The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (2) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</para><para>It is a clause that is directed straight at any ability of people to have a review of the way 
 they are to be treated. Clause 91H says the same sort of thing. Clause 91K is another. Clause 91L, subsection (2) says:</para><para>(2)	 The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.</para><para>That talks about an application that is made under that section. Subsection (6) of 91L says:</para><para>(6)	 The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</para><para>So the whole thrust of this bill is to take away the ability of the courts to exercise that quality control which is their traditional function. Clause 10 says:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">10	 Section 337 (at the end of the definition of  Part 5 reviewable decision</inline> )</para><para>Add "but does not include a decision to refuse to grant, or to cancel, a temporary safe haven visa".</para><para>It is quite clear that this bill wants to go away from the trend of the open exercise of migration affairs set under Senator Ray back to having the minister make all of the decisions. As I say, the minister is a person for whom I have great respect, who has a tradition of humanitarian concerns. But, nevertheless, it is not good to be going back to having him be the sole maker of decisions which affect the lives and the futures of people like those who are fleeing from Kosovo.</para><para>I just want to say something about the people who are fleeing from Kosovo. We think very much in terms of giving humanitarian aid. We think that the only benefit in us taking people from Kosovo is to them, that somehow we gain no benefit from it. I propose that the people most likely to help Australia are people like the refugees from Kosovo, people who are highly skilled, who have been forced to flee and who may be brought here.</para><para>I want to tell a little story. We were talking about this last night. It is about a young man—who I came to know when he was much older and I was much younger—who fled from Austria at the outbreak of the war. He was from the Jewish community and had to flee. It was proposed to him, `We will get 
 you out of there, but you've got to do something for us.' He said, `Yes, what is that?' He was told, `You have got to go down to a house and get some documents, because we think these documents are very important.' So he went down to the house and got these documents—and they were genuine documents, of course—and put them in a brown envelope. He translated the name of the person who had written these documents, and he put on the documents `A. Stone'. That was the translation of the person's name, which was Einstein.</para><para>Steve Strauss, who later became a judge of the Family  Court of Australia, had a very distinguished career. Steve has a great legal mind; he is now retired and is still doing great work. He probably was not as good at physics as Einstein, who had gone to America as had many people from Europe during the 1930s and since.

They are people who well may come to help us. If we are going to do the right thing in the general moral and political sense, then we ought to make sure they come here as welcome visitors. The difficulty with this legislation is in its terms, which seem a bit mean because they say, `You can come for only a particular period of time. When you come here, we are going to put tremendous limits on the rights you might have as citizens of the world who are fleeing your country.'</para><para>This bill is consistent with the coalition's reaction to the Tiananmen Square issue. That is something we can all remember. When the tanks rolled in and broke up the student movement in Tiananmen Square, a lot of students were left here, and a lot of students fled to Australia. On the initiative of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, they remained here. There was tremendous concern about the effect they might have on our migration program, but the people who came here have added to the quality of life in this country. They have jobs, they have taken initiatives which have helped this place, and they are 
 now of no concern to anybody. They have been a very helpful addition to our population. If this legislation is a reaction to Tiananmen Square and our initiatives after that, then it is a wrong reaction.</para><para>I have quoted two examples, but there are others. I remember the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, and next year we will have the Olympic Games here again. Mr Acting Deputy President, we perhaps are a couple of people in this chamber who can remember the 1956 games quite clearly. You will remember the famous water polo match between the Russians and the Hungarians, and how the Hungarians stayed on afterwards. Our sports program has gained greatly because of that. Franz Stampl I think came to Australia at that time. You could go through a list of people who have come from countries tortured by war and who have helped us magnificently.</para><para>Given that context, to welcome these people here as the government intends is a good thing and is to be much praised. To welcome them here under the conditions that are set out in this legislation taints—and I use that word advisedly—that great act of generosity and humanitarianism that we as Australians have exhibited by making this offer. This bill needs to go through the committee stages, and the Senate needs some time to examine it.</para><para>I am going to sit down now so that Senator McKiernan—a very eminent and learned senator in this area—can have some time to speak. I think it would be a blot on the Senate simply to put this bill through without a proper discussion on the basis that we have to get onto other matters which include the GST. As I said at the start, the GST is a most important bill, but when you think of our spirits, our souls, our milieu as Australians, we ought to be talking about this legislation pretty solidly and not pushing it through just now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>4562</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank my colleague Senator Cooney for giving me the opportunity to make a short contribution to the <inline ref="s214">Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999</inline> . It will be a short contribution because we are anxious to conclude the second reading debate at this time. 
 I wish I had more time for it. I am not so certain that what we are doing—hopefully, with the passage of this legislation—is what we ought to be doing to alleviate the dreadful situation that is apparent in Kosovo and in its neighbouring countries.</para></talk.start><para>I, like earlier speakers, also have grave reservations about the temporary safe haven class of visa coming into existence in that it may be seen as a future remedy for other situations and other circumstances. I think that Australia is strong enough and wealthy enough at this time, and ought to be generous enough, to give 4,000 permanent positions to those people in Kosovo who need them.</para><para>Let us get things into some sort of perspective. The minister's second reading speech delivered in this place on the 21st of this month mentioned half a million refugees—500,000 people. Now the figure is up to something like three-quarters of a million people. If our proposals go through and we are providing some relief to some people, we will reduce that total of three-quarters of a million people to 746,000. I wonder if we could not do better in the circumstances. I wonder if Cabinet could not have done better when it made its decision on 6 April to allow 4,000 refugees to come to Australia and be granted temporary safe haven. I wonder if the earlier publicised position of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this issue might not have been the best way to continue—that is, rather than expend resources to provide relief for 4,000 people that those resources be given directly to the UNHCR and that safe haven be provided in a country somewhat closer to Kosovo. I wonder whether that would be a better situation and circumstance—perhaps it would; I do not know. But I do praise the minister, the government and the Prime Minister for at least doing what they are.</para><para>I have one other point that I want to make mention of, and I reiterate that there were many others that I wished to address that caused me grave concern in relation to the government's announcement. I quote directly from the minister's second reading speech. He said: </para><para>In Australia, defence establishments have been prepared to receive displaced persons and a range of Federal and State agencies . . .</para><para>That caused me grave concern because I had visited a defence establishment which was looking after people who were claiming refugee status when the then government used the Curtin air base in Derby as a holding place for people who were claiming or purporting to claim refugee status. It may have been appropriate in those circumstances but certainly I do not think an establishment such as Curtin in Derby would be appropriate in the circumstances for Kosovan refugees. I do not claim to be an expert on Europe, but I have seen the TV reports—as everyone else has—and they are coming from an extremely cold climate. It is their springtime but there is a lot of snow, frost and ice around and Curtin in Western Australia may not be the appropriate place for them.</para><para>A military establishment might not be an appropriate place for persons who are traumatised in the way that these people have been. Bearing in mind that we are talking about only 4,000 people, it might be better if they were placed in a more integrated part of society. I am sure there are those in our community, including the church groups, who could handle that number of 4,000. Unfortunately I must conclude my remarks at this time in order that the second reading vote can be taken.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>4563</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make some remarks about the <inline ref="s214">Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999</inline>  but in view of the time I will make my remarks in the committee stage, briefly.

I just want to say that, from the letters the minister has received and the ones to which I have responded, large numbers of people have offered support—from offers of accommodation in their homes to offers of practical support in terms of goods and services. If and when the refugees come we may be able to use those offers, but we may not be able to use them all. I think it shows the enormous goodwill that exists in this community towards people who are much less fortunate than we are and that it gives a great hope and pride in our fellow citizens.

The second line in that agreement was that `ministers may subsequently agree on the contribution of additional funds for this purpose'.</para><para>I think in his question Senator Evans said that I made no offer.

Minister, one of the many advantages of the government's tax reform package is that it will make cars significantly cheaper.

How else is the government helping to strengthen the Australian car industry?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4565</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Gibson for his question. Senator Gibson is absolutely right. One of the critical advantages of our tax reform package is that it will cut the price of new cars. Under the current tax system, which Labor is insisting that we keep, there is a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on motor vehicles. We are going to get rid of that. We are going to put in a 10 per cent 
 GST, which is effectively a 40 per cent cut in the sales tax on cars.</para></talk.start><para>So the average price of a car is going to fall by about $2,500, which will be of tremendous benefit for ordinary Australian families, who Labor do not care about. They will, of course, have $13 billion of tax cuts in their pockets as well, so a lot more ordinary Australian families will be able to buy newer cars, which will be of considerable benefit to the whole community. One thing that is often forgotten is that newer cars mean safer transport. Fatality rates in older cars are twice those in newer cars, so cheaper cars actually mean saving lives.</para><para>For the car industry, the increase in demand for cars will strengthen the Australian car industry, and this is an industry that employs 55,000 Australians. The Greens talk about the tax package and the environment; cheaper cars are also very good for the environment. Australia has, as many of us know, one of the oldest car fleets in the world. The average age is nearly 11 years. We have got too many cars running on leaded fuel.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Newer cars are much more fuel efficient than old ones. A new Commodore is about 15 per cent more fuel efficient than the 1988 model. So tax cuts are good for car buyers, they are good for the car industry, they are good for the environment and they will save Australian lives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is not the only thing we are doing for the car industry. We will soon be introducing legislation for the Competitiveness in Investment Scheme, which is a $2 billion support scheme for the car industry. We have put $4½ 
 million into the Access Australia concept car. That has been shown in 11 countries around the world, and already two Australian component manufacturers have won over $500 million in overseas supply contracts for airconditioning and instrument clusters as a result of the work on the concept car.</para><para>What is the approach of those opposite? The opposition went to the last election with just two policies on the car industry. The first was to keep the current 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. This is the mob that is guilty of the most cynical manipulation of the wholesale sales tax system for blatant political purposes that we have ever seen. The wholesale sales tax on cars in 1992 was 20 per cent. When we announced our 15 per cent GST on cars, what did the Keating government do? It immediately dropped the wholesale sales tax to 15 per cent to match the GST promise and then, as soon as it lied its way back into office in 1993, it put the tax on cars back up; not just to 20 per cent but back up to 22 per cent—a 50 per cent increase in the rate of tax. There was no compensation, no lock-in, no nothing. It was one of the most dreadful, cynical manipulations of sales tax we have ever seen.</para><para>The other promise they took to the election was to triple the import duty on four-wheel drives, which would have made a Land Cruiser, which many Australians have to drive in the bush, $10,000 more expensive under Labor's policies than under ours. The Australian people said no to Labor's approach and they re-elected us. They re-elected us because we do stand for a strong Australian car industry, an environmentally responsible, safer car fleet and more affordable cars for Australian families.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Gambling</title><page.no>4566</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4566</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

It is worth reiterating that a key part of the tax reform package currently before the Australian parliament will involve a $13 billion reduction in personal income tax—perhaps the largest reduction in personal income taxes in the history of this country—and offered in a way that it can be demonstrated it will be delivered, in contrast with the Labor government's previous record.</para></talk.start><para>What would $13 billion handed back to the Australian people mean? It means greater incentive, more money in the pocket, a greater opportunity for Australians to take their own destiny in hand and plan for their future. This is what the ALP is wishing to refuse the Australian people: $13 billion of income tax reductions. That is worth repeating: $13 billion of income tax reductions.</para><para>That is not the only benefit that would flow from the restructuring of tax proposed by the coalition government. Exports would particularly benefit. What would flow from that? Greater production, the capacity for Australian businesses to grow and to employ, to continue the downward trend of unemployment, part of the legacy of this Howard government of which we are very proud. There would be benefits for the states as well.

So that can be no answer. Even Mr Hogg, the architect of their 1993 election, said, `That's no answer; it's time to move on and restructure the tax package.' Even the state Labor premiers say that it is time to move on and restructure the tax package.

She has had a longstanding interest in these issues for many years prior to coming into parliament, which she has maintained in parliament. Domestic violence is one of the most important issues facing our community. It causes havoc in the lives of many Australians and costs the Australian community in a very human way and therefore is a very high priority for the Howard government. Yesterday I released a report which recommends quite sweeping changes to laws relating to domestic violence. The report was prepared by a working party of Commonwealth, state and territory officials 
 under the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence Project. The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Model domestic violence laws</inline> , is a very important step towards improved and consistent laws in this area.</para></talk.start><para>A key recommendation of the report is that the law should provide for immediate registration and portability of domestic violence orders around Australia. The Commonwealth will assist with this by establishing a new national police information system through a $50 million initiative entitled Crimtrack. Without an effective and truly national police information system, we simply cannot give the victims of domestic violence immediate protection no matter where they travel in Australia. Additionally, developing consistent grounds for obtaining orders is also a key recommendation of the report. The report proposes that an order may be made where a person reasonably fears that an act of domestic violence will be committed or where a person has committed an act of domestic violence against another and is likely to do so again unless restrained.</para><para>Currently, the grounds vary from state to state. In some states the basis for obtaining an order is reasonable fear that domestic violence will be committed; in other states the test is based on an actual act of domestic violence. Again, there are recommendations for improved emergency procedures. The report recommends that police officers in all states and territories should be able to apply for telephone orders in situations where urgent protection is required outside working hours. The report recommends that police officers in all states and territories should be able to temporarily restrain potentially violent offenders at the scene of domestic violence incidents without the need for an arrest. We think that this is vital in helping to prevent violence against women and children, but it is not yet available in all states and territories.</para><para>Children require more protection. The proposed laws recognise that children are often caught up in not only the process of domestic violence but also the associated court procedures. Special measures are proposed for the protection of the privacy of children. The model laws allow for the clos 
 ure of a court where a domestic violence proceeding involves a child.</para><para>This is a final report on the basis of a discussion paper that was released in 1997 by the Prime Minister. There has been a round of consultations and now we have the final report. Obviously there will be further comments on this report and they will of course be made available to all ministers concerned. The report complements other initiatives under the federal government's $100 million Partnerships Against Domestic Violence Project such as rural and remote domestic violence initiatives, the relationship support service for men and the domestic violence community education package for young people.</para><para>Next month I will host a national forum focusing on the perpetrators of domestic violence. The Senate can be assured that the federal government is committed to preventing domestic violence and ensuring that perpetrators of domestic violence understand that their actions will simply not be tolerated.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Aboriginal Communities</title><page.no>4576</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4576</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

Clearly, the government believes that it is an important issue, but that in no shape or form reflects on the tax package that has been put before the Australian parliament. That is all about providing massive incentives for people to not only have a greater spending capacity but also be able to be taxed on their consumption. That is, I think, a very important aspect of poverty traps. You get the incentives in the right place, you encourage people to save, you give them significant taxation reductions and you put them in a much better net position.

They will share in the huge savings from the reduction in excise on fuel.

We have heard him waffling on today on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>, trying to cover up, trying to argue, `There is no revenue change.' That is what he said. Why did the Australian Casino Association approach the government in the first place? Why did they say, as the minister has admitted today, that this will have a detrimental effect on the industry? How much does this amendment for their mates give back to the high rollers, back to Ron Walker, back to the casino? That is what the Assistant Treasurer will not answer. Today in the committee stage, on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> and in question time he will not admit how much money, how many tens of millions of dollars, this amendment puts in the pockets of Ron Walker, Crown Casino and the rest of his Liberal Party mates. That is the issue here. The minister deserves the strongest condemnation for misleading the parliament. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>4582</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is an interesting argument that Senator Conroy has given us. He has given us the argument that when a business offers a rebate it should be required to pay GST, notwithstanding the fact that there is a rebate. If you are, for example, running a business and you give a discount to somebody, it would be absurd to expect that you could not claim that the discount you gave should be calculated when you work out the value added. The goods and services tax is a tax on the value added component. You look at your sales less your cost of sales. That is the basis of a goods and services tax. So if you have a rebate that you give, then of course you should be able to deduct the rebate for the purposes of calculating the tax liability. That is something that Senator Conroy does not understand, but that is exactly what we are doing here.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Why didn't you put it in the bill?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—It was always the case that the legislation was going to provide that the goods and services tax should be applied to the margin.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—Why isn't it in the bill?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—If there is any doubt about this, I suggest that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber should in fact look at the government's policy document dated August 1998.

There is one rebate that they know about all too well on the other side, and that is the rebate given by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to the former Prime Minister on his borrowings. What was the rebate the Commonwealth Bank gave to Paul Keating on his borrowings? It was $4.9 million of write-off, in May 1995. He did not have to pay $4.9 million of interest. That is a rebate. Maybe that is a rebate they might understand on the other side of the chamber.

When you go into a casino, you do not know whether you are going to win or lose. There is no sure thing in a casino. But as far as Paul Keating was concerned the Commonwealth Bank was a sure thing. He was sure he was not going to have to pay interest. He was sure he was going to be able to take the money and run. Everybody else, when they go into a casino, is gambling. Paul Keating goes in and just makes withdrawal after withdrawal after 
 withdrawal and he never has to pay it back. A rebate is basically a discount that you give and you should not have to pay GST on it.

To understand that, you have to go to who asked for the amendments and what leverage do they have on this government?</para></talk.start><para>It reminds me of the old song <inline font-style="italic">My God, How the Money Rolls In</inline>. The same characters are always there—including the federal treasurer of the Liberal Party, Mr Ron Walker, who himself boasts has raised tens of millions of dollars for the Liberal Party over the last decade and a half, who was actually going to resign, and tendered his resignation at the start of this year, but who has been prevailed on to continue in the post until a suitable replacement can be found. He has boasted that he has been a fundraiser for the Liberal Party and has raised tens of millions of dollars for the Liberal Party.</para><para>He is also the person, it was finally revealed, who donated $4.6 million to the Liberal Party back in 1996 to get them out of debt. He did that in a sneaky way. He ascribed that particular loan or donation to the Greenfields Foundation, so originally we could not find out who the donor was. What was he ashamed of? After all, he must love the Liberal Party. Surely he would want everyone to know he had given them $4.6 million. The reason he sought to cover that up is that in fact he has been the beneficiary of a degree of political favouritism unequalled in this country—for instance, from Mr Jeff Kennett. He was able first of all to re-bid for the casino licence and just happened to jump it by the exact amount necessary to win it—to make it a draw. Then he was given an expansion that meant tens of millions of dollars in extra revenue. Finally, the contract he signed was forgiven. He was bound to build a second tower to the casino. He was bound to build another theatre. All that was forgiven by the Kennett government. Fines of about $500,000 for every day's delay in that contract were all forgiven—all a free gift for Ron Walker, 
 absolutely cost free, for the man that had raised millions of dollars for the Liberal Party. Now we have it again. Jeff Kennett has run out of biscuits to throw to this bloke.

They do not go into the pockets of the high rollers, necessarily, but into the profits of the casino. Those very profits of the casino then go into Mr Ron Walker's pocket. Then Mr Ron Walker gives $4.6 million to the Liberal Party. That leads us to the conclusion that this government is becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the casino industry, just like the Victorian state government is a wholly owned subsidiary. They click their fingers; governments deliver. It is a most unhealthy thing in an Australian democracy.</para><para>In the end, it may be impossible to calculate what benefit this will be to Ron Walker—and to Lloyd Williams, a person who is basically apolitical and just looking after the interests of his casino. But as long as Ron Walker is a key figure in Crown Casino, it is inextricably allied to the Liberal Party of Australia. But I have some good news for the Australian public. Ron Walker is obviously a gambler running a casino. I reckon this amendment will hit the fence. So I have this message for Mr Ron Walker: don't pay up to the Liberal Party, don't kick into the deduct box just yet, because I don't think you are going to get a cent out of this amendment.

Senator Ray, I believe, may well have been guilty of misleading the parliament. Senator Ray yesterday was given certain documents about departmental expenditure. I understand they included expenditures by ministers for veterans' affairs, both Mr Scott and Mr Sciacca. Why did he not have the integrity to advise the Senate of Mr Sciacca's expenditures with journalists? What amazes me about this opposition is that the Labor Party allows a mere backbencher like Senator Ray to come into this chamber and make these sorts of allegations when there are people on the front bench of the Labor Party who are guilty of the conduct of which Senator Ray complains.</para><para>Let us focus on somebody who usually has some scandal surrounding him, Senator Nick Bolkus. On 23 May 1995 he spent $270 of departmental money to dine out with that poor, impoverished shock jock John Laws and others. Senator Ray's allegations undoubtedly would have been known to Senator Bolkus, but Senator Bolkus did not come in here and say: `Hang about, Senator Ray, you are just a backbencher. We on the front bench of the Labor Party, when we were ministers, engaged in this sort of conduct and, yes, I, Senator Bolkus, took out people like John Laws for dinner.' I have a whole list of expenses from Senator Bolkus taking people 
 from the media out for lunch, such as representatives of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper and even the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide Advertiser</inline> on 6 November 1995. And so it goes on.</para><para>I am sure Senator Sherry will remember this. On 31 May there was a portfolio coordination meeting, including former ministers Beddall and Collins and parliamentary secretary Sherry and the staff of their three offices, paid for by the department. Senator Sherry never got up in this place and said: `Senator Ray, you are wrong. The departmental budgets do allow for these things, and I have been the beneficiary of that sort of hospitality.' Yet Senator Ray comes in here telling us that he is—allow me to quote accurately—`highly critical of ministers taking out their staff, departmental officials or journalists and sticking the taxpayer with a bill'. Backbencher Senator Ray ought to consult with his frontbenchers like Mr Sciacca and Senator Bolkus and former frontbencher Senator Sherry, who was a beneficiary of that.</para><para>There are lists and lists of the accounts run up by these former ministers wining and dining their departmental officials, their staff and journalists.

At this society wedding there was immense enjoyment, as one could understand, because the Liberal Party personnel obviously were of the view that they were amongst friends.

It is a very cosy relationship that has been developed, and it was all on public display, with the casino bosses and the Liberal Party bosses all mixing and mingling together. I am sure that the National President of the Liberal Party, Mr Ron Walker, Director of Crown Casino, was in a particularly good mood because he understood the great benefits that would be derived from a gathering such as this. He understood that, when it came to a discussion of these matters, there could be no better place to discuss the future prosperity of Crown Casino and the future prosperity of the Liberal Party than at Crown Casino and at a wedding such as this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We were told in a recent newspaper article that it is usual when a couple gets married for them to invite their nearest and dearest.

On 28 May 1998, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into Public Dental Services released its report. The terms of reference for the inquiry covered:</para><para>.	 current and future dental needs of low income earners;</para><para>.	 the effect of the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program (CDHP);</para><para>.	 the nature of the Commonwealth's responsibility under the Australian Constitution to make laws for the provision of dental services; 
</para><para>.	 the Commonwealth's role in setting and monitoring national goals for oral health in Australia; and</para><para>.	 options for reforming the delivery of public dental services.</para><para>2.	 The Committee made nine recommendations, some of which suggested some future Commonwealth involvement in aspects of public dental care, particularly through the Public Health Partnerships. Significantly, however, the Committee did not recommend the reintroduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program (CDHP) or some similar large scale funding intervention. The Coalition members of the Committee noted in their minority report that the recommendations appeared to be "an expensive and ineffective method of tackling a problem which has traditionally been the responsibility of the States". They were also reluctant for the Commonwealth "to issue directives to the States, which should be free to deliver services in the manner they see fit".</para><para>3.	 Notwithstanding the Committee's finding that some low income earners currently have difficulty accessing public dental services, the Government's position continues to be that the provision of public dental services is a State responsibility and that the States must resolve the structural, management and financial problems in their dental services. Unfortunately, the advantages gained by the CDHP in reducing waiting times and improving access were largely offset by the unwillingness of the States to use the time to enhance their public dental services, despite knowing that there was no guarantee that the CDHP would be extended. To its credit, Queensland accepted its responsibility when the CDHP was wound up and provided additional funding to maintain services. The fact that the access problems in some States are not evident in Queensland shows the problems are not as intractable as suggested in the report. Nor, by implication, is it necessary for the Commonwealth to intervene yet again in what is essentially a State matter. The Government also notes that the Committee concluded that while the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to provide or regulate dental services it can exercise that power at its own discretion.</para><para>4.	 With the introduction of the GST, States will be better off than they would be under existing Commonwealth/State financial arrangements. The additional revenue that will accrue to the States through the GST will be at the disposal of the States to augment the range of health services available to the public, including public dental services. It is the Government's intention to allow States to determine their own priorities in the level of public dental services they provide within their jurisdictions, as they traditionally have done. 
</para><para>5.	 The Government's overall response to the recommendations of the report is that by and large, Commonwealth involvement in their implementation would be ineffective. The States must take up those recommendations they consider will improve access and service delivery. For its part the Commonwealth is prepared to assist the States to deliver better services by facilitating the inclusion of reliable oral health data in the National Public Health Information Development Plan, if this is what the States want.</para><para>6.	 The Government provides the following specific responses to the recommendations presented in the Senate Committee's report.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1: That the Commonwealth, in consultation with the States and Territories and other key stakeholders in the public and private dental sectors, support the development of programs to improve the promotion of oral health throughout Australia.</inline></para><para>7.	 Under the National Public Health Partnership Memorandum of Understanding, to which all Australian Health Ministers are signatories, State and Territories are responsible for the provision of health promotion services to meet the needs of their respective populations. If a jurisdiction determines that oral health promotion is a high priority, it is able to develop specific programs within the context of the full range of health promotion services offered within the State. Oral health has not been established by Australian Health Ministers as a National Health Priority Area, which is the precursor to planning for coordinated national action to achieve agreed national targets and performance measures.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2: That the Commonwealth Government support the introduction of a vocational training program for new dental graduates, especially to assist in the delivery of oral health services to people in rural or remote areas. </inline></para><para>8.	 The Government supports the implementation of a vocational training program and notes that given each State's responsibility to maintain an adequate workforce in the public health sector, it is a State responsibility to cover the cost of establishing or maintaining such a program.</para><para>9.	 At the same time, the Commonwealth does provide some support for essential infrastructure in the form of multi-purpose service centres that are available to underpin the provision of oral health services to people in rural and remote areas, should States decide to invest in these services as a priority. Also Government's University Department of Rural Health Program has the potential to assist in the delivery of oral health services to people in rural and remote areas. The establishment of a university department at Whyalla in South Australia 
 provides an example of where the Government's 1996 initiative has established appropriate infrastructure in the nearby city of Port Augusta for a viable dental service. With the cooperation of the university sector, the model established at Port Augusta could be introduced in other rural areas of Australia where there are university departments of rural health: that is, Broken Hill, Mount Isa, Shepparton, Launceston, Geraldton and Alice Springs.</para><para>10.	 Some Aboriginal Medical Services have infrastructure in place which can be used to support dental graduates undertaking vocational training supported by the States. The use of facilities in these services by dental graduates undertaking training will not only provide excellent learning opportunities but will benefit the communities by providing a minimum level of service. Appropriate supervision arrangements for dental graduates would need to be a key element of the vocational training provided in these areas.</para><para>11.	 The Government notes from the Senate report that a working party with primary interests in the operation of a vocational training program for dental graduates is examining this matter and that the States and Territories will consider the report of the working party when it becomes available. The Senate report does, however, point to the difficulties of the proposal such as supervision of trainees in remote areas and the estimated cost; issues that will need to be considered by any authority adopting the proposal.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3: That the use of dental auxiliaries such as therapists and hygienists be expanded, particularly to cater for the needs of specific disadvantaged groups and that, to this end, the States and Territories be encouraged to review legislation restricting the employment of such auxiliaries.</inline></para><para>12.	 The Government supports this recommendation. As State legislation limits the employment of dental therapists to the public sector and its provider agencies, the report has highlighted a need to examine and amend relevant State legislation, both in regard to where therapists can be employed and the age limitations of the client population they can treat.</para><para>13.	 The specific dental workforce requirements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the community sector will need to be addressed in any legislative changes made by the State/ Territories. These needs can be identified within the context of the Framework agreements for indigenous health between the Commonwealth, the State/Territories and the community sector where regional planning processes are being established. A National Health Workforce Modelling Project underway will also be assessing overall workforce requirements in this area.  
</para><para>14.	 This recommendation appears to have the support of the key players in the provision of dental services and now requires adoption by States and Territories.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4: That support be given to a national oral health training strategy for health workers and carers, specifically including those working in the fields of aged care and Aboriginal health.</inline></para><para>13.	 The intention of the above recommendation in promoting nationally consistent oral health training is supported. Should the States choose to develop national strategies through a forum such as the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, the Commonwealth would be supportive.</para><para>14.	 The Government recognises the special needs of older people with regard to dental health. The Standards and Guidelines for Residential Aged Care Services state that residents' oral and dental health should be maintained though ensuring that regular assessment, treatment and access to appropriate dental services occurs. Workers in the residential aged care sector have a responsibility to understand that oral health has a major influence on residents' quality of life. The guidelines suggest that staff education should address oral and dental care, including strategies for residents with dementia and challenging behaviour. While the Government encourages the pursuit of best practice in all facets of residential aged care, by both service providers and professional associations, it prefers not to be prescriptive in its approach as to how this can be achieved. However, oral health training strategies could be incorporated into existing education programs for carers of the aged, or where necessary, programs could be implemented.</para><para>15.	 It is important to consider oral health training, particularly training in prevention, in the context of the overall health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Programs in oral health can be introduced into health worker training as part of the overall primary health care approach. A review of health worker training is currently underway and will be considering a range of issues including gaps in training delivery. Oral health care training can be taken into account as part of the review process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5:  That the Commonwealth Government assist the States and Territories to establish, conduct and evaluate highly targeted pilot programs to address the priority oral health needs of the following specific disadvantaged groups:  pre school-age children (1 to 5 years), young adult Health Card holders (18 to 25 years), aged adult Health Card holders (65+ years), the home bound, rural and remote communities, and indigenous Australians. Such programs should include a capacity for the individual beneficiary to make a contribution to the treatment costs. 
</inline></para><para>16.	 The evaluation of highly targeted pilot programs to address priority oral health needs is highly desirable if the needs of specific disadvantaged groups are to be addressed. Under the former CDHP the Commonwealth funded several demonstration projects with the aim of evaluating strategies for improving service delivery in rural and remote areas, including services for indigenous people.  The evaluations provided some useful models of service delivery which States have incorporated into their public dental health care programs. At this stage it is up to the States to pilot programs for any other disadvantaged groups within their jurisdictions that they consider require special attention.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6: That the Commonwealth Government adopt a leadership role in introducing a national oral health policy, and give consideration to the possibility of using the National Public Health Partnership as the vehicle for developing and implementing that policy in partnership with the States and Territories. </inline></para><para>17.	 The National Public Health Partnership is a working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to strengthen the national public health infrastructure and response capacity. Its focus is on public health; that is, disease and injury prevention and control, and health promotion. It does not have a mandate in policies and programs for the treatment, management and care of diseases and illnesses once they have occurred. Recommendations 6 and 7 clearly envisage a national oral health policy, which has a "whole of system" approach; that is, there is an emphasis on access to treatment services, quality and service targets in addition to prevention and promotion. Nevertheless, the National Public Health Partnership, in considering national public health information requirements, is including information about oral health status and service utilisation in its deliberations. This work should, in the longer term, enhance population health outcomes in the States and Territories.</para><para>18.	 In addition, the Commonwealth funds the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to support the Dental Statistics and Research Unit to collect and analyse data and report on adult access to dental care and adult oral care.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 7: That the national oral health policy include the:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">.	 Setting of national oral health goals;</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">.	 establishment of national standards for the provision of, and access to, oral health care and the quality of services;</inline></para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">establishment of national strategies and priorities for oral health care reform, with an emphasis on preventive dentistry; 
</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">.	 setting of minimum service targets; and</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">.	 monitoring national oral health goals through  the maintenance of a national data collection and evaluation centre and undertaking research into current and projected needs.</inline></para><para>19.	 This recommendation is partially supported by the Government, in so far as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (funded by the Health portfolio) will continue to maintain its data collection, including dental statistics, for the foreseeable future.  This data will provide basic information for States' use in planning, policy formulation and evaluation.</para><para>20.	 At present the Commonwealth is unaware of any evidence for declaring oral health a National Health Priority Area, which would be the necessary first step for national policy development, encompassing a "whole of health system" approach, the negotiation of goals and targets, service benchmarks, national monitoring and reporting processes.</para><para>21.	 Nevertheless, the Commonwealth will table recommendations six and seven in the National Public Health Partnership forum to ensure adequate consideration of their public health aspects. Those aspects of the recommendations that relate to treatment as opposed to prevention and promotional activities would need to be separately considered by States and Territories as they are outside the domain of public health and are not the business of the National Public Health Partnership.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8: That the Commonwealth allocate resources for a national oral health survey, to be conducted as a priority, to establish data on the oral health status and oral health needs of the Australian community. </inline></para><para>22.	 The Commonwealth supports the collection of data on the oral health status and oral health needs of the Australian community. To this end the Commonwealth funds the Dental Statistics Research Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.</para><para>23.	 Good baseline data on oral health is important and the Commonwealth is actively trying to include the collection of such information in the National Public Health Information Development Plan now being finalised as part of the work of the National Public Health Information Working Group.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9:  That the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services create a dedicated section or appoint an appropriately qualified senior officer with responsibility for oral health matters, and that the necessary resources to fulfil the role and responsibilities of such an office be provided.</inline></para><para>24.	 This recommendation is not supported by the Government. The level of Commonwealth involvement in dental health is appropriate given that the 
 planning, funding and delivery of public dental services are State responsibilities. Policy matters across States are properly raised in the Health Ministers' forum. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) convenes specialist working parties when necessary to consider specific dental issues such as fluoridation of water supplies and amalgam and mercury use in dentistry. Appropriate members of the dental profession are then appointed as necessary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>4591</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted;

The Sydney Olympics is a good news story for Australia and, indeed, it is a very good news story for the government. It is an opportunity for Australia to be at the forefront of international attention. For Sydney, the exposure and attention derived from being an Olympic host city is immeasurable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That quite memorable 4.00 a.m. radio broadcast in which Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that Sydney had been chosen as Olympic host city will forever stick in my mind, and we have heard much over recent times since then. However, in the euphoria surrounding that announcement and the profound level of work that has occurred since, both within the organising committee and within sporting organisations in this country, it seems that one issue has yet remained unresolved: who will have the great honour of opening the Olympic Games.</para><para>One would think this would be quite a simple question, that indeed we would turn to the person who heads the Australian government. But we find ourselves in the intervening period embroiled in a debate about whether or not Australia should become a republic. The person who one would think is the obvious choice, having in his hands the prime ministership of this country, we now find advocating in the republican debate that Australia should not have an Australian head of state; that, indeed, it is entirely appropriate to have someone else—that is, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II—fulfilling that role.</para><para>I had the privilege of attending the Constitutional Convention as a delegate on behalf of the Australian parliament, indeed the Australian Labor Party. There I heard the Prime Minister advocate at great length his commitment to an Australia that persisted with a monarchy and a monarchist in the position of head of state. So it is with some surprise that we come to this point in this particular debate where we find the Prime Minister very pleased to announce to all Australians and, 
 indeed, our monarchy overseas that he will be the one opening the Olympic Games.</para><para>Sitting back and looking at how this scenario plays out, I often wonder about the conversations that could have occurred within the Prime Minister's office: `Well, we've got this position on the monarchy; we want to perpetuate Australia as a monarchist state with Queen Elizabeth II as our head of state. But oh, oh, that means we might miss out on a good news story; we might miss out on opening the Olympic Games. So let's just put aside our commitment to Queen Elizabeth being our head of state, and why don't you open the games, Prime Minister?' `What a great idea.'</para><para>So here we have it. We find ourselves in this place contemplating the double standard that has been applied to this whole issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic. With the acute symbolism relating to our status as a nation provided by the opportunity of the Olympics on the global stage, in my view we should proceed down the path to becoming the Republic of Australia before the Olympic Games. Why? So that we can have an Australian head of state, the official head of state, being the one to preside over and conduct the opening of that prestigious event.</para><para>It is a pretty sad reflection on a government whose approach to governance to date, I think, has been riddled with many inconsistencies, and I would focus particularly on its inconsistencies in relation to sport. It is clear that this government is happy to involve itself in every good news story in relation to sport. But it is not so keen on putting its money where its mouth is. It is not so keen on coming up with the dollars that will fund Australia's capability to develop its presence in community sport and that will ensure that we can hang on to what is a very proud tradition and record in our performance and participation levels in what is far more than a weekend or weeknight pastime. Indeed, sport is part of our culture, and an essential part at that. I look over the past three years, as I see John Howard announce to the country that he will open this great event—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Mr Howard, please.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>—with, no doubt, great fanfare and international coverage, and note that this government has withdrawn funding from sport, particularly at the community level, in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. At each successive budget we have seen a further diminution in public investment in community sport in this country. Whilst there has been an attempt to maintain the elite funding levels in preparation for the Olympics, that has been at the expense of community based sport.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So, in the very first instance, this government is prepared to leap to the highest podium, the highest platform, and claim credit for a glorious event in the most blatant way possible, but it is not prepared to underpin that involvement or that commitment at the elite level where it counts—at the grassroots level, providing an opportunity for all Australians to participate in sport.</para><para>Over the last three years of the coalition government, we have seen a complete rejection of the structure that Labor put in place in its previous period of governance. Labor put in place a comprehensive approach to not just managing the community level of activity and participation in sport but also building a structure that allowed the progression of community athletes into elite sport. More and more we have seen under the coalition government this disaggregation between community sport and elite sport. Why? Because they are just not prepared to supply that base level funding to the sporting associations.</para><para>So, when I talk about the government withdrawing their commitment to sport, it is actually at that fundamental level of how communities organise themselves around participation. A significant number of national sporting associations were actually defunded in the first budget of the coalition government. Surprise, surprise, they were the borderline sports: is it recreation or is it sport? Recfish is a classic example of this. It is one of the greatest participation sports in this country. Yet, through an elaborate interpretation of what constituted a sport, the govern 
 ment decided that they would defund this particular organisation, regardless of the fact that fishing and the sport associated with it has one of the highest participation rates in this country, and for many of the participants it is the only sport they participate in.</para><para>The issue of participatory sport goes one step further—that is, where its status is in the policy scheme of things. The coalition government have reduced funding in this area and they have done it at a time when the short-sightedness of this policy could not be more obvious. They have done it at a time when the Olympic Games actually presents the most profound opportunity to encourage all Australians to participate even further in this particular activity. We do have a great legacy with respect to sport, and why not create an even better one? How often does a country get the Olympic Games?</para><para>How often would a country like Australia have the opportunity to actually focus on a level of physical activity, be it centred on organised sport, on the platform of celebrating our national performance in such an international sporting event as the Olympics provides? It does not come along very often, and yet we see this opportunity being squandered as community sport is devalued by this government through defunding and we see the disaggregation of the relationship between elite sporting programs and community level sport.</para><para>The other area that is worth mentioning is the Paralympics. So often in the Olympics debate the athletes with disabilities and their event, the Paralympics, do not rate a mention. At this stage, the Paralympic Games are yet to attract a host broadcaster, and a far greater degree of attention needs to be paid to this aspect of the Paralympics event by this government. I ask this question: if the Prime Minister is so keen to involve himself in opening the Olympics, does he have an equal interest in the Paralympics?</para><para>The funding pressure on the Paralympic movement and organisation leaves a lot to be desired. This is not an organisation which has access to the sorts of sponsorship arrangements and deals that the able-bodied athletics associations have been able to organise for 
 themselves. They are worthy recipients of very active government support but, unfortunately, that has not been forthcoming. So I put out a challenge to the government in this respect: with all of the hoo-ha, the accolades, the recognition and the good news stories that will come from devoting time, energy, resources and money—taxpayers' money at that—to what I hope will be an exciting and positive event, why not look a little further to the Paralympic event and look at the inspiration, bravery and courage of those athletes, what they bring to Australian society and how they contribute to the spirit of Australian sporting culture?</para><para>Like so many other Australians, I find that the Paralympians, perhaps even more so than the able-bodied athletes, really say what has to be said about the spirit of Australian participatory sport, about having a go and about getting out there and being the best that you can be in, let us face it, very challenging circumstances. For my part, nothing is more inspiring than seeing our athletes with disabilities getting out on the track, getting in the pool or wherever, doing their stuff and bringing home those accolades for Australia.</para><para>So where do we go from here? In introducing this issue, I spoke about the Prime Minister's commitment to retaining Australia as a monarchy and about Australia having a sporting culture that goes way beyond just a weekend pastime and the interrelationship between the two. This country really needs a Prime Minister who brings consistency to policy making. We in this country really need a Prime Minister who, if he is to accurately reflect the views as to where we need to go as a nation in developing our identity and in making the most of what is an incredible opportunity in hosting the Olympic Games in this country, first of all, must recognise the importance of an Australian head of state, which he has inadvertently supported by his haste and his endeavour to be at the forefront of this Olympic event.</para><para>This inconsistency in the Prime Minister's position is not going unnoticed in the community. It is not going unnoticed that, in the first instance, the Prime Minister argues against an Australian head of state, yet then 
 vehemently advocates behind the scenes that he, as an Australian, must open the Olympic Games because that is what is important. He knew the rules and protocols with respect to the Olympic Games; he knew that it was the job of the Australian head of state to open the Olympic Games. But no, he chose to do a little bit of work behind the scenes and get his face, his body, up on the podium and behind the microphone on the big day in the year 2000.</para><para>I do not think the Australian public will forget the Prime Minister's actions when it comes to the referendum that will be conducted later this year in this country to decide whether or not we should go down the path of becoming a republic and put into our Constitution, our laws, that we have an Australian head of state. I actually think the Prime Minister and those in the government who do not support an Australian head of state—and, hence, the current proposal relating to our progression towards a republic—are politically obligated now to reconsider their position. If they do not reconsider and if the Prime Minister does not turn around now and say to the Australian public, `I was wrong. I now understand the symbolic importance of having an Australian head of state so we can do things like open the Olympic Games,' then I think the Australian public will treat the Prime Minister with the contempt he deserves.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4595</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Lundy has raised two issues and I will deal with them seriatim.

 course, that was not necessary for the purposes of the debate. This is a debate, and we are talking about debating points on the other side.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us talk about commitment to sport. Everybody knows that the New South Wales government would be in a real bind were it not for the willingness of this government to step in and plug much of the financial shortfall which is facing the Sydney Olympics. On the Labor Party side at a federal level, the belief is that there should be a blank cheque made payable to the Olympics. The reason they believe there should be a blank cheque made payable to the Olympics is that they do not want anything to rebound on the state Labor government in New South Wales.</para><para>That is a perfectly valid political position to take. But it is not a valid governmental position to say that there should be a blank cheque to cover any budgetary shortfalls suffered by the Olympics. The fact is that this government has been extremely generous with the New South Wales Olympics. It has been extremely generous both in cash and in kind contributions to making sure that the Olympics is successful.</para><para>The federal government, neither when my colleagues on the other side of the chamber occupied the treasury bench nor now, has never been the guarantor of the Olympics. Underlying all of the arguments that you have heard from Senator Lundy is the assumption—it is a quiet assumption, but it is still there and was running all the way through her speech—that the federal government should be the guarantor of the Olympics and, more importantly, that it should be the guarantor of the political fortunes of the New South Wales Labor government. That is what they are really asking us to do: to be the guarantor of the fortunes of the New South Wales Labor government.

That is just good government, but it is good government that irks the New South Wales Labor Party and irks their Labor colleagues in Canberra because blood is thicker than water, and it is certainly thicker than money when it comes to the Labor Party. I do not think it is correct for Senator Lundy to make some of the accusations she has made.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the Paralympics, she is totally wrong to suggest that this government is not committed to Paralympic sport.

That was an initiative of this coalition government. That gold medal disability access program was not something the Labor Party had. They never had a program like that. It was a program which was put together by the former minister, Warwick Smith, and a very good program.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—So good he lost his seat.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—Senator Schacht sees everything in terms of crude politics and whether Mr Smith won his seat or did not win his seat. It had nothing to do with the electoral outcome in Bass. But this is an interesting point because the Labor Party do not care whether a program is good or bad. The only thing that interests the Labor Party is how many seats they win. They could not care less about morality. They could not care less about what is right or what is wrong or what is good or what is bad. The only thing that matters to the Labor Party, as you see from 
 Senator Schacht's interjection, is how many seats they won. That is all that interests them. They are not interested in whether the government does something good. They are not interested in whether this is a good program. They are not interested in the fact that this is something they never did in government. They are not interested in any of that. They are solely interested in whether Mr Smith won or lost his seat.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are interested in doing good things for the Australian community. It goes beyond the crudity of the politics that you see on the other side of the chamber. It goes beyond crude politics because what we are talking about is doing good things. Our commitment through the gold medal disability access program is very, very clear. There can be no hedging, fudging, misleading or obfuscation. This is a program they never had when they were in government. We put it in place when we got into government. That is the difference between the two. I say that our commitment to Paralympic sport should be judged on that. That is a very, very clear point.</para><para>While I am on the subject of Paralympic sport, I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the people who are involved in Paralympic sport. Some of them happen to be very close friends of mine. For example, Hamish McDonald is a great guy and Anton Flavell is another excellent athlete. I share Senator Lundy's concern that sometimes these people do not get the recognition in the general community that they ought to get. When you have athletes who are as talented as this, they ought to get more publicity. They ought to get more public recognition.</para><para>The government works very hard, but at the end of the day the media chooses who are going to be our athletic heroes. That is not something I can influence, no matter how much I believe that people like Hamish or Anton or Lisa Llorens should have more public recognition. No matter how much I believe it, it is not going to change the public perception unless the media is willing to change it. Just because Paralympic athletes have a low public recognition factor, it is not the fault of the government; it is in fact the fault of the media. I believe the media should 
 accept some of their responsibility. They are slowly doing so. The fact that athletes like Neil Fuller and Louise Sauvage get some public exposure is excellent, is good, and it ought to happen.</para><para>I make one other observation about Paralympic sport: let us accept Paralympians for their dedication as athletes. Rather than saying, `They have all these terrible burdens,' why don't we say, `They train as hard as able-bodied athletes and they deserve the same recognition'? They deserve not special recognition but the same recognition. That I think is the real point about the Paralympics. The great thing about our Paralympians is that, when you go to the AIS and to any of the training venues where they train, the thing you have to observe is that they train like everybody else. It is not that they train specially; they train like everybody else.</para><para>It may be that people like Hamish McDonald, for example, who can do dips with a 45-kilo weight hanging off his waist, have extraordinary ability, extraordinary talent. I do not know any able-bodied athlete who can do dips with 45 kilos hanging off his waist. The point to make is: they train like everybody else. That is why they deserve recognition, not special recognition, not pity. They deserve our recognition and respect because of the talent and commitment they have, which is shared with the able-bodied athletic community as well. That is my view anyway.</para><para>The second matter that Senator Lundy raised in this motion today was that of republicanism. Let me make it very clear: we believe that the head of government in this case should open the Olympics. There is a reason why the head of government should open the Olympics: the Queen does not want to open the Olympics. Then you have a simple choice. Should it be the head of government or should it be the Governor-General? It is interesting to note that the view that the Prime Minister should open the Olympics is shared—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">LUNDY</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>—It's a disgrace.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—Senator Lundy interjects from other than her seat.

If Senator Schacht had not so rudely interrupted, I was going to say that it was Mr Knight's view that the Prime Minister should open the Olympics if the Constitution remained unchanged. Senator Schacht cannot help himself. He has to interject. He has to yell. He has to scream across the chamber. He always does it. The tragic thing, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that the quality of the interjection never gets any better. It is the view of Mr Michael Knight, the New South Wales Labor government's Minister for the Olympics, that if the Constitution remains unchanged the Prime Minister, as head of government, should open the games. That is very clear.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those on the other side of the chamber, however, want to somehow change all this. One of the most spurious reasons I can think of for wanting to change our Constitution to make this place a republic is that we are going to have the Olympics and therefore we should become a republic to celebrate the fact that we are going to have an Olympics. What do we do if we get the Olympics in another 20 or 30 years time? Change back to a constitutional monarchy to celebrate it again? Of course not. The Olympics is a great thing but, at the end of the day, it is a set of games. I love sport, but sport is just sport. Sport is not 
 a reason to change the Constitution. I would hope that the collective intellect of the Australian Republican Movement could come up with a better reason for wanting to change the Constitution than that we are going to celebrate the Olympics.</para><para>The Olympics will last for a couple of weeks, but a republic is forever. For the short-sighted, short-lived and simple-minded notion that we should celebrate the Olympics, they want to change the Constitution. But a republic is forever. The changes they make—the ills they import into the changes in the Constitution—will be with us forever, for a long time after the Olympics are gone, after people have ceased to remember the great feats of heroism, the great failures or whatever happens at the Olympics. Long after those things have ceased to be part of the popular consciousness, long after the Olympic heroes have passed away, we will still be left with their constitutional folly—the folly that we should change the Constitution simply because of the Olympics.</para><para>There have been all sorts of ridiculous arguments trotted out by the republicans. One of the best, and I think Senator Ellison will appreciate this one, laughable reasons why we should have a republic was to become more like our Asian neighbours and be better accepted in Asia. That is one of the most absurd propositions that has ever come forward. But, interestingly enough, that was never a proposition they made whenever they went to Japan. They never said to the Japanese Prime Minister, `Oh, by the way, we want you to know that our domestic constitutional policy is to change to a republic to be more like you,' because Japan is a constitutional monarchy.</para><para>In fact, if you look around the eastern Pacific area, there are as many constitutional monarchies and protectorates of constitutional monarchies as there are republics. If you asked me to make a choice as to where I would prefer to live, I would prefer to live in some of those constitutional monarchies rather than in some of those republics. If you asked me if I would prefer to live, for example, in the constitutional monarchy of Japan or the Republic of Indonesia, I know where there is 
 better protection for the rights of the individual—it is in the constitutional monarchy of Japan. But by becoming a republic we do not become more or less like the rest of Asia. We do not become more or less like any of our Asian neighbours. Yet this was some of the absurd argument we heard being trotted out by the Australian Republican Movement.</para><para>What I point out to the republican movement is simply this: they should show us how becoming a republic makes Australia a better democracy. The bottom line is that they cannot, because by becoming a republic you immediately politicise the head of state if the head of state is directly elected. If he or she is directly elected, they have to go to the people with a platform and there is politics in it. Any time people stand for election, be it for the president of a republic or the president of a tiddlywinks club, there is going to be politics in it.</para><para>One of the flaws of the Republican Movement's proposal is that they take the highest office in the land, the unifying office of the land—that is, the role of the Queen's representative—rip it apart and replace it with a republican model where half the people in the country are working politically to undermine the head of state. That, they think, is good, smart and intelligent politics. I say that it is morally and intellectually moribund to foist that sort of nonsense on the people of Australia.</para><para>Do we want to have in Australia in the future a repeat of the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal? Do we want to see the highest office in this country, if we become a republic, debased and dragged through the mud in some absurd scandal about who happened to be sleeping or otherwise entertaining the president? That is what they would do. In a political system where the head of state is popularly elected, half the people will be trying desperately hard to drag that sort of filth out into the public domain. That is what they would do.</para><para>Consider this other factor: you cannot become a popularly elected president without having a party political machine backing you. Suppose, for example, we had a Liberal or National Party president and a Liberal or 
 National Party government and the government did something wrong. What is the probability that the president would sack the government? Very, very small, because the president would owe their party allegiance to the government.</para><para>Let us assume you take the other route. The other route is to say, `Look, we're going to have not a popularly elected president but an appointed president.' That is not making the country any more democratic and it does not better protect the people from the parliament. The role of the Governor-General is to protect the people from the parliament so that, in the event of a constitutional crisis, the Governor-General sacks all members of parliament and calls a fresh election and lets the people have their say.</para><para>Nothing in the idea of an appointed president makes that more likely, but the model that the Constitutional Convention threw up was one where the Prime Minister of the day could sack the Governor-General at any time, without any reason, without any trial and without any cause. Does that add to the stability of the government of Australia? The answer is no. It in fact adds to weakness and instability, yet that is what they want to foist upon us, that is what their argument is all about and that is why they are wrong. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>4600</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought I would begin my contribution by reminding the Senate what we are debating today.

 been quite clear. It is a simple one. It is guided by the fact that members of the Australian Labor Party both at a parliamentary and an organisational level unanimously advocate an Australian republic. It is a policy that is enshrined in the Labor Party's platform.</para><para>If a president is installed soon after the republican referendum paves the way for constitutional change then the president should open the Olympic Games. But there may not be enough time for such an inauguration to follow a resounding yes vote in a referendum, so as far as the Labor Party is concerned the fall back position should be, and I think this would be the view of all republicans, that without a president the Prime Minister of the day should open the Olympic Games. That is a very clear position. We are republicans. If there is no president then an Australian should open the Olympic Games. Her Majesty the Queen should not open the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. People may be astonished about this, but in relation to this situation we actually agree with the Prime Minister.</para><para>You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that as a senator one receives a great deal of correspondence from constituents. I do not normally come into the Senate chamber to read into the<inline font-style="italic"> Hansard</inline> record correspondence I receive. I am going to make an exception on this occasion. It is not a long letter. I am going to read the first paragraph of one of the very many letters I receive and respond to as a senator representing the state of New South Wales. It is a copy of a letter sent to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, after the last election by a constituent in Sydney. He has indicated that he did not receive a response even though he went through his local Liberal member of parliament. This is what the letter says:</para><para>Dear Prime Minister</para><para>Congratulations on your re-election. I often say to my children that if John Howard can become Prime Minister, anyone can.</para><para>I thought that is a very interesting letter to have received and an interesting sentiment that many Australians would embrace.</para><para>But today we are looking at what John Howard's position is on the monarchy. There seems to be a real conflict between his stated aim of a no vote in the republican referendum and this burning ambition he has to open the Olympic Games in Sydney. If there is one issue that really demonstrates the hypocrisy of John Howard and the hypocrisy which underlies so many actions of this government it is his appropriation of the job, the task, to open the Olympic Games in Sydney.</para><para>We now have John Howard continually undermining the republican referendum. What about this ill-judged, inadequate and overwritten preamble that he penned recently? It is so embarrassing to Australians. He backs the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy.

 cal purposes, because he knows Australians will not be impressed if Her Majesty the Queen opens Australia's Olympic Games. It seems to me that we have quite a similar situation to that of the Senate chamber, where, as I have said on many occasions, Senator Colston has stolen a Labor vote. On this occasion, it is Mr Howard who has stolen the Queen's role at the Sydney Olympic Games. I think that if Mr Howard was serious about being a monarchist, he would invite the Queen to open the Games. But there seems to be a significant dose of hypocrisy here in the actions of the Prime Minister. Mr Howard tells anybody who wants to listen that, when he was a mere shadow minister, he put his view on the record that the prime minister of the day should open the Olympics. He will add that at that time it could have been anybody—it could have been Dr Hewson or Mr Keating or somebody else who could have been Prime Minister in the year 2000. I think that is a classic spin from Mr Howard on this issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Howard always had only one political objective, and that was to become Prime Minister of Australia. He never had a clue what he would do when he actually won the title, but he was always absolutely obsessed with becoming Prime Minister. I think he had a vision of himself as the monarchist Prime Minister opening the Olympic Games in Sydney. I suppose we could say that he has a similar sort of vision to that of Sir Robert Menzies—what would you expect from Sir Robert Menzies' heir? Mr Howard says that he is the most conservative leader that Australians have ever had. To be fair, I think you can say that if Mr Menzies was Australian Prime Minister at this time he would probably have ensured that it was the Queen up there on the podium and not the Australian Prime Minister who was opening the Olympic Games.</para><para>But, you see, this is the difference: Sir Robert Menzies was actually faithful to his own ideas. He genuinely believed in fulfilling his monarchist principles. He was faithful to the Crown. Mr Howard, on the other hand, is a monarchist when it suits his political objectives. I am sure Senator Schacht would agree 
 with me that you would never have seen Sir Robert Menzies rudely shoving the Queen off the podium at the Sydney 2000 Games. That would have been a very unedifying display from Sir Robert and I expect we would never have seen it. Sir Robert Menzies, of course, believed utterly in the place of the monarchy in the Constitution of Australia. In 1956, when Sir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister, we had His Royal Highness Prince Phillip open the Games. For all the snivelling cant that we are so used to from Mr Howard, I never describe him as a monarchist these days; I always describe him as a Howardist. After all, he really is an opportunist through and through. He is a monarchist to the second last ditch, basically. If he can be a monarchist and also get on the podium to open the Olympic Games, that is fine by him.</para><para>I notice that Dame Rachel Cleland today has come out to absolutely bag the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, which may come as a surprise to many old-fashioned Menzies-era Liberals. I have heard of an ABC item which indicates that the Prime Minister has been accused of lacking vision for Australia. And this criticism has been made by 93-year-old Dame Rachel Cleland who, of course, is one of the Liberal Party's longest-serving members and widow of Sir Donald Cleland, who helped establish the party. She has a crack at all the major political parties, because she thinks they are out of touch, but she says the Liberal Party appears most backward. Dame Rachel makes the point that the Liberal Party is a far cry from the one that her husband helped create. Let me quote Dame Rachel today about the Liberal Party:</para><para>It was alive, vigorous, forward looking, looking into the future, quite different from what it is now.</para><para>What a condemnation of Mr Howard and the Liberal Party in 1999 from one of its great stalwarts! It is important to see how Mr Howard has managed to get himself into this situation of insisting on opening the Olympic Games. It is worth looking at the history of Olympic funding by the Commonwealth. In 1995, the then Labor government set the ball rolling with capital grants of $150 million to prepare the Homebush site, grants to training programs and the Olympic athlete program of 
 $60 million, with a further commitment of Commonwealth money as the year 2000 approached. No-one in the Labor government had the hide to ask for the job of opening the Olympics. The Labor government attached no strings. The Games had been won by Sydney and Labor recognised that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to chip in with funding to get the infrastructure in place for the Games. It is a national responsibility when you hold the Games in Australia. In opposition Mr Howard of course promised to uphold every Olympic commitment that was made by the Labor government—every one.</para><para>But when the Howard government took office, Mr Howard asked his tourism and Olympics minister, Andrew Thomson, to write to the new South Wales government with a list of demands. In return for handing over the funds already committed by Labor, the Commonwealth wanted blocks of tickets for guests, corporate boxes in the main stadium and in the superdome and a mooring for an Incat hydrofoil at Pier 7 in Pyrmont for a business hospitality centre, and they demanded that the Prime Minister open the games. Then those demands, of course, were sent to the New South Wales government in early 1998. Mr Howard's own department was responsible for the negotiations. In other words, what the Liberal government did was tie Commonwealth funding to a decision that Mr Howard open the games—Mr Howard puffing himself up with all his pomposity and bombast on the podium so all Australians can be embarrassed in the international arena when they see him. No funding from the Commonwealth unless Mr Howard opened the Olympic Games.</para><para>Of course, that is the problem, and that is how this decision was relayed to New South Wales—no negotiation, no discussion, no consultation; just a threat from the Prime Minister. We know it was not an official cabinet decision, because I asked Senator Hill whether the Prime Minister had the support of his colleagues in relation to his demand that had been placed on the New South Wales government. Senator Hill, of course, in answer to my question said this:</para><para>To use the word `demand' is to somewhat overstate the position, but certainly the view that the Prime Minister of the day is the most appropriate person to open the games is one that is supported by the cabinet.</para><para>He said that it was not an official cabinet decision but had the unanimous support of ministers. I bet it was pretty embarrassing to all the cabinet ministers also to put their names and the cabinet's name to such an act of brazen hypocrisy on the part of Mr Howard.</para><para>And, of course, Mr Howard instructed that an official write to the New South Wales government and SOCOG, and he simply did this: he used millions of dollars of Commonwealth money, millions of dollars of public money, to lever himself up onto the podium at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. The Prime Minister of Australia has even removed the value of the blocks of tickets from the federal funding and, instead of providing $32 million to New South Wales for games services, as put in the 1997 appropriations bill, he has subtracted $1.2 million for that total. I do not know how tickets for federal ministers and, no doubt, Liberal Party flunkeys and supporters are defined as `funding for games services', but we will measure this at a later stage.</para><para>So a lot of money is being poured into this podium to give what I believe is a small-minded, miserable, poll-driven Prime Minister his brief moment of glory at the Sydney Olympics.

The head of state, of course, is Queen Elizabeth II, and Mr Howard wants to make sure that she remains Australia's head of state. That is the sort of vision we have from this Prime Minister and from this government. Do not ever forget that Olympic motto, `faster, higher, stronger'.

 excellent contribution of our leader, Senator Faulkner. There is no doubt that this Prime Minister is at the least inconsistent in his views when it comes to the issue of the opening of the games and the future head of state of Australia. One could even go so far as to mention the word `hypocrisy', but we are not allowed to do that.</para></talk.start><para>In the absence of there being an Australian head of state at the time of the opening of the Olympic Games, I support the proposal that the Prime Minister open the games. I do so on the basis that that is the best alternative available and likely to be available at the time. It is the best alternative to the actual Australian head of state, namely, the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, herself opening the games.</para><para>We all know that the normal procedure—indeed, it has been the procedure, as I understand it, at every Olympics of the modern era—is for the head of state of the country of the host city to open the games. But interestingly enough, for the Olympic Games that will herald in the new millennium—the Sydney Olympics in 2000—that we in this country have the great honour to host, we have had to face this issue: who can we get to open our games? We were not able, apparently, to follow the tradition of the head of state opening our games. Why? Because whilst the Prime Minister personally—and publicly, as he has stated—strongly supports the maintenance of the current situation that our head of state is whoever is the head of state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, nevertheless he knows that it would be totally unacceptable for a foreign head of state to open the Olympic Games in Sydney next year. He knows that that would be the signal to the Australian people and to the world that, when it comes to hosting the Olympic Games, we can put on the best show on earth but we have to get a foreign citizen and foreign head of state to open the games on behalf all Australians and all the athletes assembled.</para><para>The very fact that we are having this debate here this afternoon demonstrates the inconsistency in the Prime Minister's position on the republic. If we now had our own head of 
 state—an Australian citizen as the head of state—this issue would simply not have arisen. No matter how much I listen and how hard I try to understand the arguments of people like Senator O'Chee and other monarchists, including the Prime Minister, I cannot understand how they can say to the Australian people, `None of you is good enough to be the head of state of this great nation.' Apparently not one person out of 18 million Australians can qualify, according to our Prime Minister, to be the head of state. Rather, according to the Prime Minister, we have to rely upon a foreign country 20,000 kilometres away to determine who our head of state is. And further, we shall accept as our head of state and should continue to accept as our head of state whoever, on the basis of the accident of birth and the system of hereditary monarchy, becomes a future king or queen of England. We in this country apparently are not good enough, according to the Prime Minister.</para><para>Yet the Prime Minister believes that when it comes to the opening of the games, he is good enough to undertake that solemn task. He can push the Queen aside. This is not a gentle tap on the back to guide her into her seat. This is to push the Queen out of the road and take on the task himself of opening the Olympic Games, one of the most significant events in the history of this country. It really is a case of `Wham, bam but no thank you, ma'am.'</para><para>The Prime Minister's inconsistency when it comes to putting his own personal glory and his own ego before tradition extends into other areas of this debate. Let us look at his proposed preamble. The Prime Minister said that he would draft a preamble, and he has done so with the assistance of some people—but he ignored the assistance of Les Murray when it came to all of the content of that preamble, and imposed his own will—and he has released that. But he has made it very clear that his is the preamble that we have to vote upon. He has made it clear that he will not accept or even listen to the views of the Senate. This is the same Prime Minister who, back on 8 June 1995, when responding to the proposal of Paul Keating, the then Prime 
 Minister, to move towards an Australian head of state, said:</para><para>The great problem with the approach outlined by the Prime Minister last night is that he will not give you, the Australian people, the referendum question, that is the referendum option that you want. He will pass—</para><para>that is, Mr Keating—</para><para>through the parliament without your involvement the referendum proposal that he and he alone wants. He will then demand that you answer his question at a national referendum. Our approach is quite different. Our approach is to involve all of the Australian people at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. Our approach includes all Australians. Our approach is to allow you to help decide the kind of Constitution the Australian people want for their future, not the kind of Constitution the current Prime Minister wants for your future. Our approach is to allow the people of Australia to decide not only the question and the options but also fundamentally the referendum itself.</para><para>What noble, pious words from the then Leader of the Opposition, our now Prime Minister Mr Howard! But those sentiments have been ignored. They have been thrown out when it comes to this issue of the preamble. Because, as I said, the Prime Minister has made it very clear that we have to cop his preamble—his convoluted, disjointed, uninspiring piece of doggerel. No-one else can proffer a suggestion, and he will ignore the views of the Senate when that matter comes on for debate in this chamber. If we do not agree with his proposal, then he will say, `I'm sorry folks, but you won't get a vote after all.'</para><para>Of course, what the Prime Minister really wants with that attitude is to scuttle the preamble, to scuttle the referendum and to retain the existing Constitution and the existing foreign head of state. He wants to retain the preamble as it is currently worded in the Constitution. It reads:</para><para>WHEREAS the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under the Constitution hereby established: 
</para><para>And whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the Commonwealth of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen:</para><para>Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—</para><para>That is what the Prime Minister would like to continue to have in our constitution. As some of you know, I have been a student of English literature and I love English history, but it is a nonsense to suggest that we should retain a constitution that has as its preamble those historical relics. In my view it is a nonsense to suggest that we are not independent enough, not good enough as a nation, to have one of our own citizens as our head of state.</para><para>John Howard is big on tradition; he said so. But when there is a bit of personal glory to be gained, when he can appear on the world stage, on TV, watched by billions of people around the world, then tradition flies out the window. As Senator Faulkner said, he will not mind standing up there on the podium, or whatever else he is standing on, soaking in the glory and no doubt thinking to himself that there are a few hundred million people out there who think he is the head of state. That is why he let it be known, I believe, that he wanted SOCOG to call on him to open the Games. It seems that for this occasion he can ignore the Constitution; he can ignore the fact that the Queen is our head of state and that the Governor-General is her representative.</para><para>I note that the Prime Minister, in another somewhat sneaky manoeuvre, has invited the Queen to visit Australia. I think it is later this year or early next year that she is planning to come. I don't have any problem with that. I am not so sure that people regard such royal visits as all that relevant any more, but that is fine. We have visits from foreign heads of state and leaders from time to time. We have them visiting this parliament and the Prime Minister hosts a lunch for them. What always strikes you when you go to one of these functions for a visiting head of state or leader of another country? At the start of the proceedings our Prime Minister gets up and toasts the head of state of the visiting representative of the other country and then that 
 person gets up and toasts our head of state. Who does that person toast? It is the Queen.</para><para>You should see the looks on the faces of the people assembled in this, the Australian Parliament House, in this great building, the symbol of real democracy and representation of the people. You should see the looks on the faces of even the diehard monarchists opposite. They cringe every time they see that. That should no longer happen.</para><para>Whilst the Prime Minister has invited the Queen to visit Australia, I don't think he has invited her to come to the Olympics. We know that she is not coming to the Olympics. There will be plenty of heads of state from other countries visiting the Olympics, I would imagine, but not the Queen of England. And why not? It might be a bit embarrassing if she is there cheering on the British athletes rather than the Australians.</para><para>In my remaining minutes I turn to some of the other inconsistencies that surround this debate about a republic. The arguments of Senator O'Chee and other monarchists both in the parliament and in the ACM, the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, are riddled with inconsistencies. For instance, they put up arguments like, `The Queen is the Queen of Australia and therefore that makes her a different entity from the Queen of England,' and, `We don't need to change our Constitution because our head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia.' This is a spurious proposition. She is, by act of parliament, the Queen of Australia but she is still the Queen, the monarch, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—She is the Queen of Australia only when she is in Australia.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—That is true. Senator Schacht reminds me—only when she is in Australia. But the Constitution retains the provision that the head of state of this country is the monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, her heirs and successors. Under the current constitutional arrangements, whoever her heir or successor is will become our head of state.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another inconsistent argument that is put up by the monarchists to try to divert people 
 from looking at the real question—the real question being should we or should we not have an Australian as our head of state—is that the Governor-General is really the head of state. I don't know how many times I have heard spokespersons for the monarchists argue that the Queen is the head of state and we should not change it because we have really got the best of all worlds; we have got a foreigner who does not live here and therefore we do not have any problems. Then they go to the proposal that she is the Queen of Australia. They even argue, `Well, no, the Governor-General is really the head of state.' They cannot put forward a logical, consistent argument, because there isn't one.</para><para>But even if it were to be the case that the Governor-General was the real head of state of this country, then why not make it absolutely official? Why don't the monarchists argue that we should get rid of the fiction in the Constitution so that it reflects what they claim is really the case? The reason they do not put that argument is because it is a spurious argument. It is a deliberate misrepresentation of the true legal position. I think one of the most spurious and, indeed, deceitful arguments put forward by those who seek to oppose an Australian becoming our head of state is the argument that we have a constitutional monarchy, that we have a stable system of democracy and that we should not change it because, if we do, chaos might follow. Our stable system of government in Australia is due very much to our democracy, to the fact that we are an island continent and do not share land borders with other countries and to the fact that we have never suffered the problem of invasion—though the Aboriginal people would argue otherwise. But, most importantly, our stability is, I believe, due to the inherent character of the Australian people. It is not something that was bequeathed to us by the British monarchy. It is a nonsense to suggest that constitutional monarchies are good governments and are always stable and that republics represent the road to unrest and chaos.</para><para>Senator O'Chee—I heard his remarks—said that you politicise the office when you have a president of a republic. Senator O'Chee 
 should go back and look at a bit of recent English history. The greatest political crisis this century in the United Kingdom occurred about 60 years ago when Prince Edward was the successor to the throne of the United Kingdom. But what happened? There was a huge political and constitutional crisis because he wanted to marry a divorced woman. The parliament effectively said at that time, `You cannot remain the king of England,' because it was believed to contravene the Act of Settlement of 1701. Prince Edward, the Duke of Windsor, was forced to abdicate. He could not continue his rightful succession to the throne. A huge political and constitutional crisis went on in England at the time. What happened here in Australia? We sat back, waiting, and wondering: `Who are they going to appoint as our future head of state?' Eventually, the British parliament, the politicians, forced Prince Edward, the Duke of Windsor, to give up his right to the throne and his brother was appointed as King George VI of England. The current Queen is the daughter of King George VI. So let us not have any of this nonsense that somehow constitutional monarchies are above politics and better than republics.</para><para>Anyone who knows anything about English constitutional history knows that parliamentary democracy in England came about as a result of overcoming the tyrannies of monarchs—you have only got to look at what happened to Charles I to know that. Indeed, it is parliament that is supreme in that country. But in this country we are reliant upon whoever becomes the king or queen of England to be our head of state. That is, I believe, a situation that we should no longer have to accept. As the eyes of the world and the eyes of all Australians are upon us next year at the Olympics, we should be able to show the world that we are truly and completely Australian and that all Australians can aspire to be our head of state. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>4607</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Might I say at the outset that Labor, in bringing forward this motion for debate today, really demonstrate what a pathetic opposition they have become.

It demonstrates loud and clear that the Labor opposition is so bereft of real and substantial issues on any shortcomings on the part of the government which it can attack that it is reduced to attempting to fabricate an issue out of something that clearly is not an issue. The issues that it is trying to fabricate relate to, firstly, the Prime Minister's personal view on the most appropriate constitutional arrangements for Australia and, secondly, the Prime Minister's personal view on who should open the year 2000 Olympic Games being held in Sydney. Not only is the Labor Party showing that it is completely bereft of ideas and issues by bringing forward this motion but, in trying to beat up this matter into an issue today, it is showing how out of touch with the country at large it has become.</para><para>Where has the community demonstrated its concern about these matters? As far as the issue of the Constitution is concerned, about half the community, if not more, agrees with the Prime Minister's position on our present constitutional arrangements. I suspect that by the end of the year, when we hold a referendum, well over half the community will agree that our present constitutional arrangements, which have served Australia well for some 98 years, are quite adequate and quite appropriate for our future.</para><para>As far as the opening of the Olympic Games is concerned, the only references I can find to a concern about the Prime Minister opening these games are the comments of a couple of radio talk show hosts. There is no widespread concern in the community about 
 the Prime Minister's position on either of these issues. This is clearly a Labor attempt to beat up an issue because, in regard to the matters which are of primary concern to the people of Australia and for which the government has responsibility, the government is clearly and demonstrably doing an outstanding job.</para><para>Let us not beat about the bush. When this government came to office a little over three years ago, the federal government finances were in an absolute mess. We faced an annual budget deficit of $10 billion—a $10 billion black hole. Yet, in less than three years in office, we managed to convert that deficit into a budget surplus by a combination of sound financial management and government restraint. As a consequence of that, and as a consequence of the government's generally sound financial management, the government has inflation at not an all-time low but certainly the lowest level it has been in the last 30 years. That was reinforced by the most recent inflation figures released yesterday. For the last three months, we have had an inflation rate of virtually zero. For the last 12 months it was something of the order of 1.2 per cent. It is an extraordinarily low rate of inflation, given the history of the last decade or so. Again, it is runs on the board for the present government.</para><para>As with inflation, interest rates are the lowest they have been for 30 years. Low interest rates are a benefit to home buyers. They reduce the monthly repayments for housing, leaving more money in people's pockets to spend on other goods and services. That has a flow-on benefit to the economy. That is why the economy has grown strongly over the last year or two. We have had record low interest rates in the last 30 years. We have seen unemployment falling as a consequence of that. As a consequence of increased demand and economic growth, unemployment is falling. As I mentioned earlier, we have achieved a budget surplus.</para><para>It is a very sound financial position for the government and a very sound position for our economy. I remind the Senate that low interest rates benefit not only home buyers but also business, and in particular small busines 
 ses—most of which operate on overdrafts or borrowings to sustain the activity of their businesses and, therefore, generate a real benefit and real opportunities for growth when they have low interest rates. Again, there are benefits to the economy. That, in turn, has meant that the rate of growth in Australia has been the highest of many of the OECD countries with which we have compared ourselves for the last year or two. In particular, this rate of growth has been sustained in the face of the Asian economic crisis.</para><para>Under the Labor Party, we became increasingly dependent on Asia as our main source of export income. Yet, firstly, because of the sound financial management of this government, and, secondly, because we have directed our trade activities on a broader front than just Asia, we have maintained a level of economic activity and a level of exports that have sustained that underlying strong economic growth and sheltered the Australian community from the outcomes of the Asian economic crisis. In particular, it has provided jobs growth rather than increased unemployment, which might have been the logical outcome of succumbing to those Asian economic problems.</para><para>In contrast to these policy initiatives, we find that the Labor Party is a complete policy free zone. Over the last 12 months or so, a couple of Labor parliamentarians have sought to generate some policy debate within the Labor Party, recognising that unless they have soundly thought through policies that they can put to the Australian people they have absolutely no chance of winning a future election. Mark Latham is one of those. The outcome for those individuals who have sought to facilitate a policy debate in the Labor Party is that they have been sent to coventry. They are not wanted in the Labor Party because the Labor Party is a complete policy free zone. It has no policies.</para><para>As I said at the outset, not only does the Labor Party have no policies; it has no issue on which to attack the government. The lack of issues is clearly demonstrated by the fact that they are putting up this motion today as a general business debate. It has also been generated in the Senate over the last couple 
 of weeks and in the Senate since we began sitting after the last election. We have seen desperate attempts by the Labor Party to beat up into issues of concern issues that are not really there at all and certainly are not matters of concern to the wider community. We have seen them yet again try to crank up a scare campaign in this chamber on the GST as we debate the new tax system and the much needed tax reform legislation. They have not only beaten up a scare campaign; they have filibustered in that debate. Last night we saw from a senior Labor senator, Senator Ray, an exhibition of relevance deprivation syndrome perhaps even more evident than that which—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President.

If I had the chance to speak to it, I would have made exactly that point. The excerpts of the debate that I have heard have ranged far and wide, far beyond the narrow specifics of the motion before the chair. This matter that I am raising is relevant, because one must look at the motive that the Labor Party have in putting forward this motion. As I say, the motive is that they have nothing else to debate. There are no issues out there of real concern to the community. That is why the Labor Party are trying to fabricate an issue of this nature.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I was saying, we had this example of Senator Ray last night exhibiting even greater relevance deprivation syndrome than his colleague in the other place Mr Gareth Evans exhibited as a shadow minister. I guess Senator Ray, having been a senior and somewhat respected minister in the previous Labor government, would be experiencing that on the backbench. His relevance deprivation syndrome is such that his concerns these days are limited to what, where and with whom ministers in this government eat. That is the limit of the issues he is able to raise.</para><para>We have also seen question time in the Senate become an absolute non-event, with the Labor opposition being unable to raise issues of substance. Day after day we sit here as questions of no substance whatsoever are asked of government ministers, one after the other.</para><para>As I say, the reason for this motion being put forward today is that the opposition has absolutely no issues with which to attack the government; it has no policies to put before the Australian people to compare with the sound policies that the government has initiated and with which it has achieved results. So let us understand the reason for this motion having been put forward.</para><para>I turn to the issues that the opposition is trying to fabricate here: the issue of an Australian president replacing our present constitutional monarch, and the issue of who should open the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. These issues really are quite unrelated. However, the Prime Minister's views on the Australian Constitution are well known. He has always expressed, and expressed strongly, his personal view that Australia should remain a constitutional monarchy. That is a view I share very strongly with him. Both the Prime Minster and I share the view that the constitutional monarchy has served Australia well for the 97 or 98 years since Federation and the Commonwealth government being established, that it does provide stability, that it has been able to deal with the occasional constitutional crisis that has arisen and that seeking to fiddle with the Constitution in the way proposed leaves it open to all sorts of unknown, and perhaps unintended, consequences. So, as I 
 say, the Prime Minister's views on this issue are well known, and they are views that I share.</para><para>Nevertheless, the Prime Minister initiated a Constitutional Convention last year and accepted its outcome; he also accepted that that outcome would be put to the Australian people in a referendum, as it will be in November of this year. He has therefore fulfilled that commitment. That is as it should be. He has made that commitment, and he is fulfilling it. At the end of the day it will be the Australian people, not the Prime Minister, who will determine whether or not we abandon our current constitutional arrangements and establish a republic in Australia, with a president as the head of state rather than our current arrangements. That will be determined by that referendum in November of this year.</para><para>For that to occur, we have to have not only an overall majority of the Australian people vote in favour of those changes but also a majority of people in a majority of the states to approve amendments to the Constitution. A majority in at least four states will have to support the propositions for our constitutional arrangements to change. Again, that is proper and appropriate because the very foundation of our Federation in Australia is that the smaller states should have weight equal to that of the larger states in determining amendments to our Constitution and should not be dictated to by the larger states. That safety provision is there to ensure that there is general support for any significant changes to our Constitution.</para><para>The question of constitutional change is being addressed. But even if that referendum votes in favour of a republic for Australia, under the legislation that has been put through this parliament and which goes to the referendum, a president will not be in place prior to January 2001. So, first of all, we need to consider whether there will be a change. Secondly, we need to consider the timing of that change, if there is to be one—and, as I say, it will not occur until 2001. Indeed, unless there are changes to the Constitution, the only option for any organising committees—whether organising the Olympics or any other major events—faced with who to invite 
 to officiate at functions remains the status quo.</para><para>Many functions and ceremonies take place on a daily basis throughout Australia, and always up for consideration is the appropriateness of who should open or officiate at those functions. Depending on the nature of the occasion, it may be appropriate for a mayor, a state premier, a state governor, a federal minister of the Crown or, indeed, the Governor-General to officiate at those functions; it may be appropriate for the Queen to be invited to do so, or it may be appropriate for the Prime Minister to do so. The fact is that it is the organisers of those functions who generally determine whom they would like to have conduct that opening ceremony.</para><para>In the case of the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000, the Sydney Olympic organising committee announced on 22 April—that is, only last week—that, should Australia have a president by the time of the games, the president, whether male or female, would be the person to open the games. However, the organising committee also stated very clearly that, if no such presidential office is in place by the time of the games, the Prime Minister will perform this role. As I said a few moments ago, we know for sure that, irrespective of the outcome of the referendum at the end of this year, the president, if we move to that form of Constitution, will not be in place by the time of the Olympic Games; he or she will not be in office until 2001. On that basis, and knowing that to be the case, the Sydney organising committee has made the final decision that it will be the Prime Minister who will open those Olympic Games.</para><para>The fact that the Sydney organising committee has selected the Prime Minister to be the officiating person underscores the point that these games belong to all Australians. The decision that the organising committee has made on this matter I am sure reflects the opinion of the general public that it is highly appropriate to have the Australian Prime Minister open the Olympic Games.</para><para>This is not a recent view on the part of the government, which shares the view of the Olympic committee and shares the view of the Australian people. As long ago as when 
 Paul Keating was Prime Minister and John Hewson was Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Prime Minister of the day to open the Sydney Olympics. It was certainly reinforced by John Howard when he was Leader of the Opposition that, as the most senior and highest profile elected Australian figure, it was appropriate for the Prime Minister to open the Olympic Games.</para><para>This is not something that the Prime Minister has initiated since becoming Prime Minister to glorify himself in front of an international audience, as some have suggested. It has been a consistent view of the Liberal and National parties for some six or seven years—well before there was any suggestion that John Howard might be Prime Minister or even that a Liberal Party leader might be Prime Minister at the time of the Olympic Games. It has been a consistent view, and it is an appropriate view. So let us have none of this nonsense that this has happened in the last year or two now that John Howard is the Prime Minister and that he has sought this apparent glory for himself.</para><para>As I said at the outset, there is no issue here at all. It is an attempted beat-up on the part of the Labor Party because they currently have no issues that are of concern to the general Australian community to raise in the Senate. The people are satisfied with the very good government they are getting from the Liberal and National Party coalition and the leadership that Prime Minister John Howard is providing.</para><para>With regard to the attempt to beat up this issue, the two issues—the constitutional position and the position of who should open the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000—are quite unrelated. They are separate issues. Indeed, the views of the Prime Minister on these matters are private. He is not expressing the view of the government with regard to the Constitution. As I said, on behalf of the government, he has initiated a constitutional referendum which will give the people of Australia the opportunity to determine our future constitutional arrangements. Similarly, his view that the Prime Minister 
 should open the games is a view that he has held for a long time. It is a view that the Liberal and National parties have held for a long time and have publicly expressed, irrespective of who the particular holder of that office might be at the time the games came around.</para><para>So let us have none of the nonsense that has been put up in this motion. It does not stand scrutiny. It is an attempt to beat up an issue that does not exist. It is about time the Labor Party got a hold of some real issues, but there are none. They should at least do some solid policy work and look for some policies that they could put to the Australian people that might give them some chance of garnering some support, which they sadly lack at the moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4611</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The question here is whether there is inconsistency between the Prime Minister's view that we should remain a monarchy and his view that he, as elected Prime Minister, should open the Olympic Games, which, under the rules of the International Olympic Committee, are opened by the head of state. Clearly, there is an inconsistency.</para></talk.start><para>If one believes that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is the proper head of state, one should be pursuing a request for Queen Elizabeth to be there at the Olympic Games to read out the 13 or 15 words which are the required opening speech. The International Olympic Committee must have learnt from experience to give the heads of state no latitude but to read out a simple opening statement of two or three sentences. That does the job without having a captive audience held to a long speech from a politician who cannot help herself or himself. Whichever way this turns out, it will be a very short, succinct opening speech, and I do not think that is going to worry Australians too much.</para><para>The opportunity to open the games was too great for the Prime Minister, and he sees himself in that position, on that podium, on the night next year in Sydney delivering those 15 words. I am not unduly fussed about that. But, seeing we are in transition between being a monarchy and becoming a republic, I think the proper thing would have been for the head 
 of state in Australia, the Queen's representative, the Governor-General, to read that speech.</para><para>Towards the end of his speech, Senator Chapman, who was the last speaker, said that in the last six or seven years there had been general agreement between the government and the opposition that events such as the Olympics ought to be opened by the Prime Minister, the elected head of government of the day. This is a very significant innovation. I do not think Australians will agree with that. Either we have a head of state or we do not have a head of state. I think Australians would have been terrifically proud to have the non-political head of state, Sir William Deane, opening the Olympics next year. I think it would have given everybody a very warm feeling.</para><para>There is the rough potential that some people will see an elected Prime Minister as not being their cup of tea when the time comes. I am not unduly worried about that. It will be a great event. Australians will be riveted by it, and I think they will be much more interested in the pyrotechnics and the display under the floodlights at that magnificent new stadium than they will be in the 15 seconds or so in which the Prime Minister delivers the prewritten opening words.</para><para>We are moving inevitably and ineluctably to becoming a republic where the functions of the current Governor-General in general terms will become those of the elected head of state, the president. Therefore, in this transition period, it is logical that the person to open the Olympics is the Governor-General. It is a missed opportunity, and I think the Prime Minister would have been seen as being more generally committed to the idea of Australia moving on had he requested that the Governor-General perform this function. He wants to undertake it himself. I do not think it is a matter of enormous moment. I hope that, when the day comes, he gets enjoyment out of reading the opening words, and I am sure Australians will feel terrifically proud and happy about that event taking place.</para><para>What about the head of state, though? What is going to be the relationship between the Prime Minister and the president when that 
 time comes? I am one of those who are concerned that we are seeing a move towards the prime ministers of the day seeking the advantage of office to not only invade the role of the elected head of state—particularly at ceremonial functions, such as the opening of the Olympics—but control the future presidential office. That is a matter of great concern.</para><para>In the upcoming referendum, as a consequence of the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention, we are going to be voting for a president who will be elected by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament—the Senate and the House of Representatives—after a process of selection and agreement by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and a selection panel. What people do not know is that it is not incumbent in this arrangement for there to be a two-thirds majority to dismiss the president. The Prime Minister can simply, by signing a letter of dismissal, dismiss the president summarily. It does not matter how correct or how popular the president has been; if he or she gets the Prime Minister's nose out of joint, the Prime Minister will be able to dismiss the president.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—If you don't like it, vote no.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Boswell, I am a staunch republican. The national meeting of the Australian Greens held a month ago here in Canberra also thought that was not a proper process—that if it requires a two-thirds majority of parliament to appoint the president, it ought to require a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of parliament to dismiss the president. I say to Senator Boswell, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I will be moving and fighting very strongly, when we get the opportunity in this place, to tighten up this measure to ensure that is the case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I understand that that intention was put forward in about 1986 when this real debate about the republic in its most recent chapter was set off by the writings of Professor George Winterton, the constitutional specialist. When former Prime Minister Keating set up a commission to look into how the president might be appointed, again it was said it 
 should be a two-thirds majority of parliament to elect the president and a two-thirds majority of parliament to dismiss the president. When the Australian Republican Movement was approaching the debate at the Constitutional Convention, it also thought it should be a two-thirds majority to elect the president and a two-thirds majority to dismiss the president.</para><para>I am not going to go into the complexities of that Constitutional Convention, but something happened there. Remember that half the representatives at the Constitutional Convention were not elected by the people but were appointees, and a good number were not republicans but were pro monarchy. Whatever they were, out of that Constitutional Convention came the result we have, which is a dramatic change to the safeguards of the office of president and a dramatic increase in the vulnerability and the capture by the Prime Minister of the office of president. I think this is bad for our democracy and this is bad for the prospect of Australia as a republican democracy. I will be fighting very strenuously on behalf of the Greens, not only in this place but in the public arena, to have this altered so that we go back to the manifestly fair and proper process of ensuring that parliament—and not the Prime Minister—is the agent that appoints the president and is able to remove the president.</para><para>The issue has been raised of what we do if a president takes leave of her or his senses—if, suddenly, a president is putting out some edict that is obviously not a sensible one for Australians. First of all, there is no law to prevent prime ministers going off on a tangent and doing foolish things. But if that is the case, let the Prime Minister have a suspensory opportunity for some days while parliament is recalled, and then parliament can determine whether the president's behaviour can be justified or not. The president would obviously be given an opportunity to account for what she or he is doing, and then parliament would deal with the request from the Prime Minister that this president be dismissed. What we are dealing with here, by the way, is a very, very unusual and unlikely situation, but it worries some people.</para><para>We can recall parliament within a matter of days in this age of modern, rapid transport and communications. In those circumstances, parliament can be recalled rapidly and can deal with a crisis that has arisen. I think a far worse crisis occurs if we leave it to the Prime Minister, in a period of disagreement with the president, to simply sign a document saying, `You are dismissed.'</para><para>It is a little worse than that because, in that circumstance, there is no way parliament can reappoint the president, put the president back in office. There is no provision for that under the presidential arrangements that are being put at the referendum in November. What would happen is that the Prime Minister, having dismissed the president, would appoint an interim president and then we would go through the process of having a new round of selections with parliament reappointing somebody by a two-thirds majority.</para><para>This is totally unsatisfactory. It is wrong. I do not believe Australians would support it. I do not know whether this was put into the arrangement as a means of shaking the confidence of Australians that they were getting a good arrangement for the new head of state. Whatever, it needs ironing out. I hope that all parties listening to this are having a rethink about this matter so that when it does come up in the Senate—presumably just after winter—and when I move the amendment to put things right, there will be support in this place to see that we get it right because I think the current formula is very short of the mark and would not be one that people in Australia would like to see.</para><para>Yesterday I had the pleasure, together with Mr Gareth Evans and Senator Stott Despoja, of releasing an alternative preamble proposed for the Constitution of Australia. We know that the Prime Minister released his version of the preamble a short while ago. I want to talk about that for a moment. It is my view that the best preamble is one that will come from the people, with maximum consultation. I am aware that there is a very wide range of views in our community and that we have to take all of them into account. But it is also a matter of great symbolism and a great opportunity to reflect the Australia that people hold in their 
 hearts through these few sentences at the front end of our Constitution.</para><para>I want to make it clear that I have not entered into supporting an alternative from this side of the Senate with a view that it is that or nothing. I do not believe that is a good process. That is why I have been strong in supporting the provision in the letter going out to newspapers about this preamble alternative that the Centennial Constitution Foundation be asked to look at the proposed alternative preamble and at input coming from Australians to the web site, which is being advertised in that letter, to improve it. This preamble is not set in concrete. It is an alternative. It is drawn from the previous input of hundreds of Australians into the work of the Centennial Constitution Foundation. That is a good group of people to be looking at further deliberations on further input from Australians.</para><para>I personally think we can go a step further and a step better than the Prime Minister's proposal, though it has support from many Australians and though his thinking is obviously very strong in that preamble option. I think a preamble ought to be simple. It ought to be stirring. It ought to reflect the Australia that people have a feeling for now. It ought to reflect something of our history and certainly reflect our hope for this great nation as we go into the next century.</para><para>I want to make it clear that this is not an exclusive bid to topple the Prime Minister's alternative. I have written to the Prime Minister this afternoon expressing that sentiment. I understand that on Adelaide radio station 5AA earlier today the Prime Minister indicated that we may well be looking at there being no preamble because his may not get through the Senate, although he has mooted the possibility of changes. But I seize upon his terminology of common ground, that we ought to be able to find common ground on this. I have written  asking him to meet about this to talk about how we do that. I think that is again what the Australian people would want. We as parliamentarians ought to be the conduit for national sentiment in drawing up a preamble—we have to put ethos 
 in front of ego, in short—and not the arbiters of what that shall be.</para><para>I am very happy with the idea that the Centennial Constitution Foundation, having done a lot of work on this already, be the people who give advice on the final form of that preamble. I hope that all involved—and we are all involved—can give, can concede and can embrace the ideas of others who do not think exactly the same way, so that we do get a preamble that reflects as far as possible that diversity of feeling in Australia, and recognise this: that we all love this country, that we all want to appreciate the symbolism which reflects that love of this nation from whichever place or point of view we might have come.</para><para>Senator Chapman said earlier that this was a debate taking place which could have better be taken up by more important issues. I want to finish by saying that at lunchtime I was at the press conference which announced the end of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. This is a representative forum and research organisation for the views of young Australians. It had representation from groups right across the spectrum, from Scouts to YMCA, YWCA and so on—community groups of great diversity in the nation and young people all. Now it is dead because government funding has been withdrawn. I think that is a matter of importance.</para><para>In particular, we have to draw on the thinking of young Australians—and what a great lot of ideas that have come from them on the preamble—on the direction they see this country needs to take, on their ideas on meeting the problems that they undoubtedly face in this vast, materialist and fearful age, and on how we can overcome the fact that this is the first generation probably in all of human history of youngsters who have been robbed of hope. If we are charged with one duty in our time as elected representatives, it is to put into place the road back to hope for young Australians. I believe that implicitly charges us with the duty to think of future generations and to take into account their welfare in everything we do.</para><para>It is a very sad thing indeed that the government has cut the ground from under 
 this youth forum at a time when tax concessions are going to strengthen the lobbying ability of groups like the Australian Mining Industry Council, the National Association of Forest Industries and so on in the precincts of Capital Hill. There it is. It is one of those things we will have to fight for a come back on. But I give a word of praise to those young Australians who have taken part in AYPAC and given such advice to the body politic in past times. I will be working as much as I can to see an early reconstitution of that body representing youth.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>4615</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating a Labor motion which reads:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate notes the inconsistency in the view of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that it would be inappropriate for a non-Australian to open the Olympic Games, yet appropriate for a non-Australian to remain as Head of State.</para><para>I have been a member of the Constitutional Convention, I have listened to a lot of debates on it, and there are many inconsistencies in the republican debate. But they are not to be found in the views of the Prime Minister, nor of the people who really want to defend the present system of government. The inconsistencies are to be found in the ranks of the ALP, who have become fixated by a term which is not even in our Constitution. This very motion is inconsistent.</para><para>Our Constitution makes no reference to a head of state because, ultimately, the power resides with the people. That is where the National Party wants it to remain—with the people. So we are staunch defenders of the current system of government. Neither are the Olympic Games mentioned in our Constitution. It is up to the nation as a whole through its representatives and its democratic system to make its own decisions about who opens what, who will be toasted at official functions here or there and who will be seated first, second and third. Those are niceties and diplomatic protocols, but they have nothing to do with a debate about how political power is shared and kept in check by popular sovereignty. The Olympics have nothing to do with a debate on constitutional change, except in one instance: if there was a constitutional 
 change to a republic, then the PM could always sack the president, and who is going to open the games then?</para><para>The Labor Party is confused. Australia is quite independent and able to determine its own way on the games opening without the need for a republican constitution. The focus on and the potential power given to this new constitutional creation of a head of state actually detracts from the fundamental role of the people. Until former Prime Minister Paul Keating turned a dinner party topic into a political red herring to try to divert the country from focusing on the recession it had to have, and for which he has since admitted he was wrong, most Australians had never heard of the term `head of state'. A head of state is a movable feast. It can mean anything to anyone. Senator Carr's version would be very different to Senator Faulkner's idea of a head of state. A head of state might be a dictator, a king, a bishop, a president, a prime minister—even a grand duke. A head of state might have very little power, as in the Irish system, or absolute control, as in the American system. It resists clear definition.</para><para>I now turn to the two greatest enemies of humankind this century. Hitler referred to himself as a head of state, while Stalin did not. The Soviet Union even had 24 heads of state. I bet they did not all turn up to open the games in Moscow. The point is that all this rhetoric about a head of state obscures the very real and very serious changes which would occur if Australia became a republic. They would not just be surface changes but ones that change the very core of our system of government and the checks and balances we hold so dear in this country and which act against the abuse of power.</para><para>There are further inconsistencies implied by this motion. Senator Carr supports the proposition that the functions of the Governor-General should be transferred to a president. Somehow in that process the magic wand is waved and the president becomes a head of state, although Senator Carr would argue that the Governor-General never was a head of state. Republicans argue that the president would do the same thing as the Governor-General but that somehow the president gets 
 to be a head of state as well. Strangely, too, the functions of the Queen, who Senator Carr argues is the only head of state currently, are not transferred to the president. I ask Senator Carr: how can the president be a head of state?</para><para>Professor David Flint, National Convenor of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy, explains further:</para><para>The Queen's role in the appointment of the President will in fact be transferred to the politicians collectively in a joint sitting of parliament.</para><para>Perhaps that would mean that we would all be joint heads of state, from Senator Carr to Senator Brown to myself, because we are then going to have the power. Professor Flint continues:</para><para>The Queen's role in the dismissal of the President will be transferred to the Prime Minister.</para><para>Does that mean that the Prime Minister is also part of this many-headed monster that goes by the name of `head of state'? Should the whole parliament turn up to open the Olympic Games? That is just farcical. It just goes to show the fragility of any argument for constitutional change based on the head of state artifice.</para><para>The inconsistencies of Labor on the republican debate are endless. They have not been able to come up with a decent model over the whole decade this debate has been trundling along but have been pushed into an appearance of life by some white wine socialists. There have been disagreements over the most fundamental issue of the manner of appointing or electing a president, whether by parliament or by popular vote. The first Keating-Turnbull model for a republic would have made Australia like the present fifth French republic—with two powerful competing politicians, the President and the Prime Minister.</para><para>The second Keating-Turnbull model goes the other way—it does a complete 180 degree turn and makes the president completely vulnerable to the whims of a prime minister, as Senator Brown alluded to.

He has expressed that view long before he became opposition leader, let alone Prime Minister. It is a considered view which has nothing to do with arguments about heads of state or republics. It is not in conflict with the constitution. As a good Constitution does, ours gives us the freedom to determine our own way on these things.</para><para>As the Prime Minister himself said of his long held view: `I felt that as the most high profile elected Australian figure, the Prime Minister was the appropriate person to do it.' I think most if not all Australians would agree with that view.</para><para>To attempt to tie that view up with the Prime Minister's known opposition to a republic, is misleading, illogical and like comparing apples with oranges. There is no inconsistency between a Prime Minister opening the games and the existing constitutional system of government. All Labor achieves by this pathetic twisting and misrepresentation of views is to let down the republican cause.</para><para>Now I know some of my coalition colleagues hold different views to the National Party on the issue of a republic. I do not agree with them but I 
 respect that they sincerely hold these different views. And I feel very sorry for them today because Labor's strategy is obviously to politicise the republic issue. In doing so they put at risk the cross party support required to have the faintest hope of getting the republic referendum passed. So while I am happy for Senator Carr to raise these sorts of issues time and again and give me plenty of opportunity to expose the flaws of the republic, I have to say that he will only do the cause of republicans everywhere a disservice. Is it really a republic which Labor wants—or to score political points?</para><para>It is rather pitiful that of all the important issues facing us these days, this is all Senator Carr and the opposition can come up with. Come back to the front bench, Senator Ray. Your party needs you. What a waste—sitting up the back in charge of the dirt files. When you could be doing so much to come up with a policy or two and some direction for your party from up the front. All Senator Ray gets to do now is to run guerilla attacks from the mountains of the back bench and pick on some decent National Party ministers only trying to do their job.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4617</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>4617</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><para>Advisory panel on the marketing in Australia of infant formula—Report for 1998-99.

The Senate is aware that at the moment there is a great deal of concern in the community about this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I want to reiterate that, if the change to the laws proceeds, we will have environmental powerlessness at a national level unseen since before 1972 when Lake Pedder in Tasmania was flooded. At that time the then incoming Prime Minister said that he did not have the constitutional powers to do anything about it although it was against the national interest that such a national heirloom and national park should be flooded for a hydro-electric scheme to produce one-tenth the output of a large mainland power station.</para><para>If this legislation proceeds we are going to be back in a situation where the federal government gives up its powers to intervene to protect this nation's heritage heirlooms, particularly where they do not have world heritage protection. It is not going to be possible, for example, for a federal minister or Prime Minister to nominate a place in Australia for world heritage listing as required under the provisions of the World Heritage Convention without the assent of the relevant state government, and that means the relevant state premier. So we are going to be in the position where the protection of Australia's heritage is going to be at the whim of a Robin Gray or a Joh Bjelke-Petersen or even a Richard Court or the current Tasmanian Premier, Jim Bacon.</para><para>Under the provisions of this legislation the Franklin River would have been flooded because the federal government would have been powerless. Under the provisions of this legislation the Daintree rainforest would have been chainsawed down instead of being proclaimed a world heritage area. Under the provisions of this legislation we would not have seen the protection of the Lemonthyme and southern forests of Tasmania. Under the provisions of this legislation we are basically disempowering the federal government. The 
 federal government is basically disempowering itself of responsibility.</para><para>This is at a time when the federal government and indeed the Labor opposition are moving to dismantle state powers in order to improve the reach of the corporate sector and make it easier for investment into and out of Australia, to get rid of barriers to trade and commerce. At this time it is disempowering itself in its vital need to protect the nation's environment.</para><para>I might add, it is disempowering itself to be able to act properly to tackle international problems like global warming because the state governments are basically going to be able to obfuscate any federal move to adequately deal with the problem of global warming at a national level.</para><para>It is rotten legislation. It is a throwback. It has obviously come about from the pressure of the corporate sector—not least the resource extraction industries, such as the woodchip, the mining and the fisheries industries. The input to the committee and the reports from the committee underline the alarm there is about this, in particular amongst the non-government organisations who are fighting for the environment in this country.</para><para>I have no confidence whatsoever that we are going to see future federal governments use their corporations powers to intervene to prevent maverick corporations from doing the wrong thing by the environment. Prime Minister Bob Hawke briefly entertained that idea back in the mid-1980s but was very quickly disavowed of it through pressure from the corporate sector. We are seeing here a dismantling of environmental powers at the federal level at just the time when they are required because of the raised environmental sensitivity of Australians and because of Australia's obligations to the international community. So it is a matter of extreme importance that the public be made aware that the environment is being let down by the government and in particular by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, who has brought this legislation into this place.</para><para>It is remarkable that under the Westminster system, where the minister for the environ 
 ment ought to be going into cabinet advocating for environmental powers to meet the aspirations of Australians in this age, he is actually going into cabinet with a document to do away with his own powers and replace them with much lesser powers so that the corporate sector will not have to worry about the environment or the impact of federal intervention because of pressure from the Australian people. It is a matter that needs a great deal of public canvassing. Most of the Australian public are unaware that the minister for the environment, presumably at the behest of the Prime Minister and certainly of the cabinet of this government, is basically handing across environmental powers to the corporate sector. The corporate sector is well aware that they can much more easily—through their sheer wealth, lobbying power, access to legal power and so on—sway state governments than they can sway federal governments having to abide by federal laws. The outcome is a disastrous one for the environment.</para><para>The Australian Greens, along with environmental groups, are fighting hard to oppose this legislation. We are concerned to see that when it comes into this Senate, it gets a very thorough going through indeed. The Greens are preparing amendments to legislation which should not be here in the first place. We are going to do the job of the minister for the environment for him. He obviously cannot act on behalf of the environment. He obviously does not act on behalf of the environment. He obviously is selling out his portfolio obligations for the environment in cabinet. He would not have this legislation before the Senate were he a responsible advocate for the environment. We are obviously going to have to do his job for him.</para><para>The problem for us is that most Australians do not know that this insidious and disempowering legislation—which so threatens the Australian environment—is before this place. It is about to come on for debate at any time once the GST legislation goes through or other priorities, such as the budget, are finished. In fact, the minister for the environment has seen that this is No. 3 on the list of 27 or so bills we are to deal with between 
 now and June. I have no doubt that he has looked at the numbers and believes that he can get the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to get this legislation through before 30 June. He knows that he would have no chance of getting it through afterwards. He is going to get a fight. It is going to be a long debate. This legislation is going to be dissected piece by piece, clause by clause, subclause by subclause, when it comes into this Senate. It is far too important to be dismissed.</para><para>The input to this committee shows how important it is to the people of Australia and their representatives, although it may not be given high priority by the government of the day. I do not know how strongly the Labor opposition, or indeed the Democrats, are going to fight against this or whether they are simply reduced to trying to amend it. The legislation is inherently wrong and should be opposed. That is what we will be doing when it comes before this place—with this report under our arms, because it reflects the fears and the anguish of environmentalists right around the country about this particularly bad piece of legislation.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>4619</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Procedure Committee</title><page.no>4619</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>4619</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator West</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate</para><para>(a)	 in relation to the use of unpublished documents in dissenting reports, adopts the amendment of standing order 37(2) at pages 1 and 2 of the report</para><para>(b)	 in relation to the appearance of private witnesses with departmental officers, adopts the views expressed by the committee at page 2 of the report</para><para>(c)	 in relation to notices of motion and postponements, adopts as temporary orders ceasing to have effect at the expiration of 30 June 1999 the amendments of standing order 76(1) and 67 at page 4 of the report.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>4619</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses were considered:</para><para>New Tax System—Select Committee—Main report.

It is a very sad thing to see a senator with such a capacity for positive contribution come into this chamber and indulge in an unworthy character assassination of political 
 opponents. Not only did his actions diminish those he specifically targeted; they diminished all of us.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Ray's own reputation has suffered. I have frequently considered that his move to the back bench was too soon. I think back a couple of years ago to those heady days when Labor ministers could actually hold their own in this chamber. There was Button, Walsh, Evans, Richardson and Ray. They were Labor's powerful and strong leaders, and they commanded a government and their party.</para><para>But what we see today is a ramshackle frontbench and a backbench resorting to dirt files, because they are leaderless, rudderless and policyless. I thought it was a waste of time to have Senator Ray sitting on the back bench with all of that talent. Now I am going to revise that assessment. It has been known, of course, that after a period of glory as a minister senators and members return to opposition and become embittered. We have all seen that on both sides—angry, grumpy old men who cannot let go and have to be continually negative. That should not happen to such a person as Senator Ray, and I find it sad and regrettable.</para><para>But what have these attacks on the National Party achieved? They have set in train, inevitably, a series of counterattacks. It has been revealed by senators on this side of the chamber that Labor ministers did exactly the same sorts of things as did National Party ministers, because the guidelines have not changed. Already, senators who have suffered in the past from these kinds of attacks have been brought into this episode as well. Will we not ever learn? What has been achieved but a further battering of the image of parliamentarians? The price is very high, and the reward is short-term political gain that will inevitably rebound. The public react to the headlines one day and then do not get to read the real facts a week later which show that there was nothing sinister after all.</para><para>Just a couple of nights ago a person rang me up, and I understand that he also rang Senator Gibbs. The call was quite threatening in nature, and the caller was clearly under the impression that we were all a bunch of so-and-sos. There will always be some who 
 abuse the system, and a need to improve accountability is there. But I firmly reject that all too prevalent view that we are all here to sit around and do nothing but waste the taxpayers' money. I never thought that of Senator Ray, and I hope Senator Ray does not think that of me either. But I say to Senator Ray, `Your actions are only helping to foster that general perception out in the wider community. Your actions only serve to help radical groups like One Nation get into parliament.' These kinds of attacks simply reinforce the prejudices which get the David Oldfields of this world elected. By all means, expose the bad and the ugly where it can reasonably be said to exist, but do not be selective. Make sure it is really there, and that the facts live up to your own subjective assessment. Senator Ray did not follow the unwritten rule in this place that when you are about to be highly critical of someone you at least have the courtesy to let them know, as I have with Senator Ray tonight.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—There weren't any senators involved.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>—But you could have rung their offices.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—They are in the Reps.

I really would like to know why that is. Senator Ray told the Senate yesterday that it was because previous experience has told us that they are the ones who get their snouts in the trough, first up and the biggest. What previous experience? That is simply highly offensive nonsense that says more about the speaker than it does about the subject.</para><para>There are pages of material which show how Labor ministers did exactly the same 
 thing. It presumably was not wrong then, so why is it being painted as some kind of heinous sin now? Ministers are entitled now, as then, to cover the cost of expenses incurred providing hospitality on appropriate occasions in the course of official business. Ministers do not have credit cards or accounts, and the department determines legitimate expenditure in accordance with Labor's guidelines. Labor ministers claimed expenses for taking out ACTU members, CPSU members, John Laws, media representatives, peak industry groups and official and departmental staff at restaurants around the country.

It is the nature of this place that when you are attacked you have got to fight back or you will be considered a soft target the next time. But it is a pandora's box that gets opened and all sorts of people get hurt, as we have seen. I am not going to name the people that we have information on. I do not think it warrants it. I do not think they did anything particularly wrong. I think the ACTU thing was a bit off. But, for goodness sake, let us bury this now. If there are any capital offences, present them, but do not put one side against the other side when they both do the same things. I consider taking someone out to lunch is not a heinous offence.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Expenses</title><page.no>4621</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>4621</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Boswell for notifying 
 me in advance, but I do not accept his criticism that I should have notified National ministers in the House of Representatives. That is not the tradition. The material that I had yesterday came to me very late. It came to me after 146 days wait. It came to me during question time. Only today did I get Mr Anderson's meal expenses. I will be equally critical of anyone on the Labor Party side that transgresses in this way as I will be of the Nationals. Senator Abetz said earlier today that I deleted that information. I simply did not have it.</para></talk.start><para>It is curious, though, that this government, against all convention and without permission, can go back and dig into Labor files and add that to answers to questions that were not asked. But that is fair enough. They have done that with three ministers and they have hardly laid a glove on any of the three ministers. But I want to say this, for once and the only time I will probably ever say it. Senator Boswell asks what I am doing on the back bench. Am I embittered? I do not think I am embittered. The moment I am I want to leave this place. Because you are right, Senator Boswell—embittered people have no role to play here.</para><para>But we do have a role in scrutiny. Some of us are allocated that role. Others create policy. Others do a whole range of things. But some of us are allocated the role of scrutiny, which is totally appropriate to this parliament, because from that scrutiny and from that adversarial system better government comes. I am not on the front bench for one reason: I do not want to be a minister again. The only people that should sit on an opposition front bench are those that want to be ministers. We have many people on our side of politics that would like to be a minister again. Frankly, I enjoyed being a minister. I enjoyed the nine years. I enjoyed the eight years in cabinet. I probably enjoyed spending $60 billion in six years as defence minister. But for me that was enough. I do not actually aspire to do it again. I am also a believer that, having been elected by the people of Victoria, I should serve my term unless health or something else intervenes. I do not ask for a job outside politics. I live off my backbench salary and I am quite 
 satisfied to do so. You do not have to actually serve on the front bench—as you would probably realise, not having been a minister—to actually fulfil a role in politics. One of those roles must be scrutiny.</para><para>What I have said about this expense issue is two separate issues. You did not mention one of them but I am going to mention it again tonight. I will get to that in a moment. The other issue is: what is legitimate expenditure for a department to pick up the entertainment costs of a minister? I spelt out the criteria yesterday. Official functions are fine. There are plenty of those. Tim Fischer put a whole range of those before us yesterday although he did not fully answer the question. There was a second, grey area which you mentioned—ACTU officials, business people, all those sorts of ones. I think they are grey areas. It is something I never did. I never stuck the taxpayer with that. But I can understand they may fall within guidelines. But I say here again that the guidelines do not cover personal staff, departmental officers and journalists. So, if people transgress on your side or have transgressed on our side, we should say they are transgressors. I said last night they were not rorters but I said they were outside the guidelines. If people on our side of politics were outside the guidelines, then they can take the scrutiny.</para><para>But why did you not raise that at the time and see if they were outside the guidelines? We are now checking this government and I say those people and those occasions are outside the guidelines. Have you seen any minister come in and table the guidelines, Senator Boswell? Of course they have not. Why not? The ministerial guidelines is a secret document, apparently. It is not publicly available. But I went back to the old one. I assume they have not changed much. I read the guidelines. It simply does not fit into these guidelines. We were given $10,000 as ministers, eventually rolled into salary because of the substantiation rules, to fit these very circumstances. It is already in their salary package for those specific circumstances when you want to take a journalist, staff member, visiting businessmen or trade union officials out. You do not need to send 
 the bill back to the department in those circumstances.</para><para>But the real problem in this was not really that. The real problem is that the question asked for the names of the individuals that were the beneficiaries of the taxpayers' funds. The taxpayers are entitled to know that. But what happens? The first time the question is asked, by Senator O'Brien, all the names are given. When I put questions on notice about five ministers the replies are deliberately delayed. They go over to the minister's office and they are rejected. Then the chiefs of staff—and you can make inquiries: they are your people—get together and say, `We've got to put a stop to this. We'll eliminate the names on that list and we'll put in broad generic descriptions,' not even giving the numbers in some cases. Where is the justification for that? If I had FOIed them it would, firstly, have cost the government an absolute fortune to answer the questions and, secondly, they would have had to give me the names of the individuals. Because it is illegal if those very chiefs of staff try to direct the FOI officer in the department as to those particular matters.</para><para>Then the senator says: `Why the NATs? They don't have any track record.' I don't want to go over the old ground too much. I still say that the greatest act of thievery I have ever seen in this parliament by anyone was a National Party minister and shadow minister claiming $68,000 travel allowance in Melbourne, where he lived for heaven's sake—tax free! I have never claimed a cent in Melbourne tax free, but $68,000 worth!</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—Your Prime Minister was doing it out here.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—You are saying our Prime Minister was doing it? When? As Prime Minister? The answer is no, he didn't do it as Prime Minister at all. One of the key points of Senator Boswell's speech—and I have to agree with him on something—was that the department determines whether the payments are okay or not. I agree. That helps the ministers out a bit. It gives them a bit of clearance that these payments were ticked off by the department. That does give them a fair bit of clearance on both sides of politics. But 
 those departmental secretaries should not have done that. I can just imagine what my old mandarin Tony Ayres would have said if I had sent him over a bill for $140 because I had taken someone out to the Ottoman. Being a Brunswick born boy, he would have got that bill, he would have brought it over to the office, he would have inserted it in an orifice and said: `That's what you can do with that bill, Minister.' So there is a weakness here, but not only on the ministerial side; there is also a weakness on the administrative side. Those bills should not have been ticked.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But what does Senator Boswell say to the Sharp claim for $1,790 for his own home entertainment? Does he really think that is a proper use of taxpayers' money? It is not for industry representatives. It is for businessmen. Aren't these just the locals whom Sharp has decided to put on a meal for? What do you say about him at the Cowra function, which clearly is a veterans' function, yet the Department of Transport gets stuck with the bill? What do you say about that Southern Highlands function that is in there, which is clearly nothing to do with the Transport portfolio, yet that department got stuck with the entertainment expenses? I have said it before and I will say it again: this is not a rort, and I have never claimed it to be a rort. What I have claimed it to be is an infringement of the guidelines in which departmental secretaries are complicitous in as much as they have ticked the bills on both sides of politics.</para><para>But the real tragedy of this, the real thing that brought this to a head, is that I found out about the conspiracy because before I got the answers. I found out about the chiefs-of-staff meeting. I was told: `When you get those answers, you will no longer see the names of the individuals. All you will get to see is their broad description.' And sure enough, yesterday and today as the five sets of answers floated in, that is exactly what we got. As always in these things, the greater crime is not in the commission of what occurred but in the cover-up. Senator Boswell has a responsibility as Leader of the National Party to explain why that cover-up occurred, why your senior staffers were a part of it and whether any of your ministers knew about it. You 
 might get on your feet another time and answer those questions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Boyd, Mr Arthur</title><page.no>4623</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>4623</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the Chair of the Senate Legislation Committee on the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I would like to make some remarks about Arthur Boyd. Arthur Boyd was a great Australian and a great Australian artist. His death last Sunday takes from us a former Australian of the Year, a leading philanthropist and a world renowned painter, sculptor and designer. Arthur Boyd was born in 1920 at Murrumbeena in Victoria and was a member of one of Australia's greatest artistic families. He left school at age 14 and briefly attended art classes at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. However, as he commented later in life, what he observed on the way to and from his art classes was of more use to him as an artist than the classes were themselves. Surroundings were an important influence throughout the life of Arthur Boyd. In 1936 he went to live with his grandfather at Rosebud in the Mornington Peninsula and completed works for his first exhibition. The Mornington Peninsula landscapes were reflected in these paintings exhibited in Melbourne in 1937.</para></talk.start><para>Arthur Boyd served in the Australian Army during the Second World War and his work of this period reflects his experience of the war. In an enterprising adventure after the war, Arthur ran a pottery at Murrumbeena in conjunction with his brother-in-law, John Perceval. But in 1949 Arthur Boyd became a full-time painter and continued his theme of landscapes while also diversifying to murals on religious themes in the house of his uncle, Martin Boyd, near Berwick in Victoria.</para><para>His public commissions commenced with a ceramic sculpture for the 1956 Olympic Swimming Pool in Melbourne and the more famous Great Hall Tapestry in this building, which was woven by the Victorian Weavers Trust and based on a 1984 landscape painting by Arthur Boyd, which today is on exhibition near the post office on the first floor of the parliament building. In 1958 Boyd's work, along with that of another great Australian 
 artist, Arthur Streeton, was chosen to represent Australia at the Venice Biennale.</para><para>As I have mentioned, surroundings were an important influence on the work of Arthur Boyd. From Port Phillip Bay, the Mornington Peninsula, Central Australia, London, Italy, Tuscany and the Shoalhaven region of the south coast of New South Wales, surroundings and life experiences influenced both the mediums and the styles in which Boyd painted. Landscape remains Boyd's most recognisable style, but during the later years of his life Boyd's work became more figurative in style and diverse in medium. His art diversified as far as graphics and as a designer for the ballet and theatre sets of the Australian Ballet and various theatre companies.  </para><para>One of Boyd's most famous series of paintings was entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Half-caste Bride</inline>, which was based on a visit he made to Central Australia in 1958. It has been said that this trip was a turning point in Boyd's life with the artist thereafter concentrating on more figurative works rather than the landscapes which he had done prior to this. Writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> today, Jeffrey Makin describes Boyd's work as a narrative. He said:</para><para>Boyd was an intuitive painter. His painting was always sensual, tactile, which can be traced back to his beginnings at Murrumbeena in his father's pottery studio.</para><para>In the late 1950s, Boyd and his wife, Yvonne Lenney, and family moved to England. In 1960, Boyd had his first exhibition in London, and Boyd and his family moved between London, Australia and Italy from the 1960s. He did not return to Australia until the 1970s, when he took up a fellowship in creative art at the Australian National University.</para><para>Boyd's list of public accolades do not come much better. He was Australian of the Year in 1995 and Irish Australian of the Year in 1988. He was awarded an OBE in 1970, an AO in 1979 and promoted to AC in 1992. He was <inline font-style="italic">Australia Post</inline>'s first living legend to appear on postage stamps in 1999. As well as being a prominent artist, as I said, Boyd was a great philanthropist. I will list some of the bodies which benefited from his generosity. The National Gallery of Australia has been a recipient of many thousands of pieces from 
 Boyd's personal collection. In another act of great kindness and foresight, in 1993 the Boyd family donated their property in the Shoalhaven, `Bundanon', to the people of Australia. And this estate now provides an artist in residence program, it houses an educational centre and a theatre, and a concert hall is being built. In conclusion, I would like to again quote Jeffrey Makin who, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 28 April, said:</para><para>The Boyd legend is indelibly a Melbourne success story. Together with Sydney Nolan, he took the Australian landscape to London and almost single handedly created an international market for Australian art where there wasn't one.</para><para>So, on behalf of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, I would like to offer condolences to the Boyd family, and commend Arthur Boyd for his kind, philanthropic nature and for his enormous contribution to the development of Australian art both domestically and internationally.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Veterans' Affairs: Study Tour</title><page.no>4624</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4624</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in the adjournment debate to speak about my recent visit as shadow minister for veterans' affairs on behalf of the opposition, the parliament of Australia and the people of Australia to Gallipoli and other places where Australian soldiers, airmen and naval personnel have served in wars of this century.</para></talk.start><para>As part of my study tour, I visited and had talks with overseas representatives dealing with veterans' issues in Greece, Egypt, Great Britain and Turkey. I also visited Macedonia to look at the terrible refugee situation there, and tomorrow I hope to have an opportunity to speak about that experience. In each of those places—Athens, El Alamein and Battersea Park—where there are memorials to Australian service men and women who died in the world wars of this century I had the opportunity to lay a wreath on behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia. In each of those Commonwealth war graves cemeteries there are, unfortunately, large numbers of Australians buried.</para><para>I want to congratulate the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for the excellent 
 way they maintain those graves, very often in difficult conditions. At El Alamein you could not see a more hostile desert environment, including those that we are used to in outback Australia. It is very well maintained and it is very moving to be there and see the many hundreds of Australian graves. The graves were mainly those of our soldiers who were killed at the famous battle of El Alamein that was a turning point in the Second World War. In Athens there is a Commonwealth war graves cemetery—now surrounded by suburban Athens—where several hundred Australians who were killed defending Greece and Crete in 1941 are buried. I attended those war graves and laid a wreath, accompanied by the head of the Greek veterans' affairs organisation. At Battersea Park there is a simple memorial to the 5,500 young Australian aircrew from Bomber Command who died in the Second World War, and again I was able to lay a wreath.</para><para>As far as the veterans' affairs part of my study tour overseas was concerned, the highlight was being able to be at Gallipoli last weekend on the 84th anniversary of the landing of the original Anzacs at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. One cannot go there but be moved by being at the original place which is so redolent of Australian history. The places that I had heard of and read about in the history books—not only Anzac Cove but Lone Pine, Courtney's Post, Quinn's Post and The Nek—are all there in such a close area. To see the area where those original Anzacs fought and died in such large numbers in such a small area is quite overwhelming. Again, the war graves and the memorials to our soldiers who were killed fighting there are very well kept and are very moving in themselves.</para><para>I also want to say that the ceremony itself was moving in that the speeches of the Governor-General, Sir William Dean, both at the dawn service at Anzac Cove and at Lone Pine at midday, were, I think, two of the best speeches I have heard commemorating the dead who served our country. I draw the attention of all Australians to Sir William's words, which I think are very much his own words, written and expressed by himself. 
 They are a great peroration in honour of not only the soldiers who died there but also what it means to Australia.</para><para>To be at Anzac Cove as the dawn broke at 5.30 in the morning was most moving. As the hills gradually emerged behind, I realised what an extraordinary task it was for those Australian soldiers to come ashore and be faced with those very steep cliffs and gullies in that dawn light. Then, as the dawn came up, I was moved by the sight of 5,000 or 6,000 people cramped on that Anzac Cove site. The most moving thing of all was that 80 per cent of the people there were under the age of 30. Many of them had slept the night amongst the graves of the Australian soldiers buried on Anzac Cove. They wanted to make sure they were there for the dawn service. Apparently in recent times one Turkish commentator said, `Isn't it a wonderful thing that these young Australians have come back so many generations later and have laid down and slept amongst the graves of their forebears who fought here?' The Turkish people saw that as a tribute, even though there is concern about the damage it may do to the cemetery.</para><para>Again, at Lone Pine there must have been 6,000 or 7,000 people at the service. You could see they were Australians because they were dressed very informally in T-shirts and jeans, wearing sunglasses and hats, but all were greatly moved by the ceremony and treated it with great respect. I had the opportunity to talk with many of them and walk with them up the road past Johnston's Jolly, Quinn's Post, Courtney's Post, The Nek, up to Chunuk Bair for the New Zealand service. All of them had made an absolute effort to come once in their life to Anzac Cove and Gallipoli to be there because that was part of being an Australian.</para><para>I made some notes on the plane coming back. These were the sorts of things these young Australians said about the reasons they were there: `It is a pilgrimage which you have to make.' `This is where Australia as a nation really began.' `I just had to come to this place which is so important to Australia.' `You cannot be an Australian unless you visit and see for yourself what these soldiers did here.' 
 `I cannot explain why, but I know that I just had to come here once in my life.' `My great-grandfather served in World War I. I owed it to him and his family to be here.' `It is overwhelming to see where so many ordinary Australians fought and died.' Those were the remarks made by these young Australians. To me and to all of us, we know that the commemoration of the Anzac spirit clearly is not going to die when so many young Australians are willing to make that effort to be there and to understand what makes it so important to them as an Australian.</para><para>The reason I went on my own personal pilgrimage or odyssey is that on the morning of 25 April 1915 my grandfather, Karl Timcke, from the 10th battalion in South Australia, landed on the beach at Gallipoli. He lasted about a day before he was severely wounded. He lay for two days in no-man's-land before he was found and brought home on the first hospital ship with a very severe head wound. He was demobilised from the Army, and in 1916-17 he was a founding member of the Returned Services League in South Australia and served on the committee. Unfortunately, his wounds meant that he became ill and he died in 1924, leaving behind a young family, one of whom was my mother.</para><para>I am the first member of the family to return to Gallipoli to see where my grandfather was badly wounded. I have to say that it was a very moving experience personally; very emotional. I hope that from now on every succeeding generation of my family takes the opportunity to go to Gallipoli to see where their forebear, my grandfather, served and bled, and to realise that the blood from which they are descended has been spilt on that sacred soil at Gallipoli. I hope all the succeeding generations of my descendants get  that opportunity.</para><para>My mother is in her 79th year. When I return home on Friday I will be able to take back to her some stones that I gathered from the very beach on which her father, my grandfather, landed as a small memento of what Anzac Cove and Gallipoli mean to my family but, above all else, to all Australians.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>18:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>4626</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.50 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4626</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>4626</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Defence Act—Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal—Determinations Nos 1-3 of 1999.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew Act—Dispensation granted under section 20—Dispensation No. 6/99.</para><para></para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>4627</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Trade: Cost of Functions and Dinners</title><page.no>4627</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 306)</subtitle><id.no>306</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4627</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 3 December 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) On how many occasions did the department pay for dinners or functions, both in restaurants and elsewhere, attended by the Minister, not including those paid for and approved by the Ceremonial and Hospitality Unit of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet prior to October 3 1998.</para><para>(2) In each instance: (a) when did the dinner or function take place; (b) what was the purpose of the dinner or function; (c) who were the attendees for each dinner or function; (d) what was the cost of the dinner or function; and (e) what was the venue.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4627</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The Department met the costs of 47 functions hosted by the Minister as detailed in the attached table.
