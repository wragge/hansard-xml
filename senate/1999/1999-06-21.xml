I take it Senator Margetts is happy with that. Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 is the first amendment to be discussed in respect of the <inline ref="r637">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> . The opposition wishes to place a few remarks on the record concerning our approach to this bill. The opposition is opposed to the bill and will divide on its passage at the appropriate time. The opposition is opposed to any amendment that seeks to allow the sale of one more share of the Telstra Corporation. We have opposed the sale of Telstra in three successive elections and that is both common and public knowledge. In this debate today, and tomorrow if it proceeds, we will again follow that election commitment, both in spirit and in intent, by opposing any further sale of parts of or the whole of Telstra.</para></talk.start><para>As the minister indicated at the outset, this bill is the most significant of the five bills in the package under discussion in the chamber. 
 This bill authorises the sale of Telstra and privatises an essential part of Australia's national infrastructure. This bill contains provisions which will enable 16 per cent of Telstra to be sold, an inquiry to be held and, subject to the findings of that inquiry, the balance of Telstra—the other 51 per cent—also to be sold in due course. As was indicated the last time we discussed the Telstra package of bills, we are coming to the point of no return. If this bill is passed, it is inevitable that in due course Telstra will go into full private ownership.</para><para>The device of holding an inquiry is fundamentally flawed and can and will lead to only one conclusion. An inquiry will not result in proper public scrutiny, proper public review and proper public consideration of the worth or otherwise of the sale of the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra. According to the bill before the chamber, that inquiry can be a private inquiry. There is no need for public testing, public scrutiny or public examination of the submissions. There are no criteria or guidelines laid down in the bill for how that private inquiry will conduct itself. It is simply a device to get over the objection of the National Party and achieve full private ownership of Telstra.</para><para>So we arrive at the point of no return and it is only proper to briefly summarise the reasons for our continuing opposition to the sale of Telstra. Three points can be made in that regard—three critical points which have guided our internal forums and deliberations in this process. Those three reasons are on the record. They were addressed in my speech in the second reading debate and in the concluding remarks made by Senator Cook. There have been numerous press releases put out by the shadow minister for communications and the Leader of the Opposition and they are contained in the platform of our party. What are those reasons?</para><para>Firstly, we say that Telstra is a fundamental part of Australia's infrastructure. It needs to be in public hands. Putting it in full private ownership removes from our nation the ability to build on this most critical part of our infrastructure as we move into the new technologies and the new information processes 
 of the next millennia. Secondly, since one-third privatisation of Telstra, various reviews have been conducted by a number of government agencies and they have all come to one conclusion: that service levels have fallen and will continue to fall over time, and that the state of Tasmania has been on the receiving end of the greatest continuing fall in those services by the Telstra organisation.</para><para>Our third reason for opposing this bill is that Telstra is a contributor to the national economy, both as an efficient telecommunications operation and as a payer of dividends to the national budget and to government. We believe this device of the government is a trick, it is a con. We are told that apparently there is a social bonus of $678 million, plus something in the order—released yesterday—of an additional $300 million to be allocated by the government. The government's rationale is to sell Telstra and allocate the social bonus as a community reward. The opposition has a different position. We say retain Telstra, keep the dividends of $1.8 billion every year for the foreseeable future. Build community infrastructure every year—not just once in select areas by allocation of a limited social bonus, but do it on a continuing basis. We say keep the golden goose, keep the dividend stream, keep building the Australian community. The savings on interest are not worth the sale of the assets.</para><para>Let me develop each of those arguments: the importance of keeping our national infrastructure as represented by Telstra in public hands; the importance of improving service standards and not reducing them, as happens time and time again when government utilities are privatised; and the importance of keeping in perpetuity a reward for business for the bush, for rural and regional Australia, instead of a miserable one-off bribe. Turning to the first argument, consider only the significance to industry of the commercial activities of the nation, the ongoing growth of an efficient telco providing needed services. In addition to that necessary growth, the opposition also identifies the human element of Telstra, not as a profit taker but in its role of bringing families and communities together. It is fundamental to the social intercourse of our 
 nation. If it is in private hands, service will not be the guiding ethic. The guiding ethic will be private return.</para><para>What is the proof of the allegation in respect of service levels? I refer to a number of government reports since December last year which have examined the provision of service by Telstra. In December the ACA identified a number of disparities. On the provision of new services it says that Telstra's performance in remote areas is down an average of 16.8 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. So rural services are significantly below those of metropolitan areas. On fault clearance within one working day, performance in remote areas is down an average of 17.2 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. On fault clearance within two working days, performance in remote areas is down an average of 16 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. The average number of hours to clear a fault in country areas is almost 57 hours, whilst in the cities it is 27 hours.</para><para>The ACA's <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications performance report 1997-98 </inline>identifies a high rate of fault repair and provision of service complaints from Telstra's residential customers. Almost 50,000 Telstra customers had reason to complain to Telstra in the June quarter. Eighty per cent of these were residential customers. Again, in late March of this year—barely three months ago—the Australian Communications Authority's <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications performance monitoring bulletin</inline> for the December 1998 quarter showed a six percentage point decline nationally for new services to major rural areas and a 24 per cent decline for Tasmania. Again, in late March, the ACA findings in the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications performance monitoring bulletin</inline> painted a damning picture of declining Telstra service delivery in rural and regional Australia. Among its findings, the ACA revealed a six per cent decline nationally for new services to major rural areas, which includes a 24 per cent decline for Tasmania, as well as an 11-hour increase in the average time for payphone fault clearance in Tasmania and a 10 per cent point decline in fault repair times for Tasmania. </para><para>So it is not just an assertion by the opposition that, when major utilities are put into private hands or partially privatised, service performance levels decline. The ACA, in its own monitoring, has looked at the empirical evidence and put in black and white that service levels are declining, have declined since the first one-third of Telstra was sold off and are not improving at all. The decline in services is no surprise because we have an inherent contradiction between the private corporation using the system to maximise returns—exploiting the most profitable markets—and minimise gain to other carriers. The further privatisation necessarily increases that pressure on the bottom line and one method of achieving that system is to reduce labour costs and service levels.</para><para>Turning to our third point, the question of reward to the Australian community, many countries are facing issues of privatising telcos and utilities generally. It is occurring in western Europe and in many parts of the United States. It is normal to go down the path of seeking a cost benefit analysis to see whether there is ongoing benefit to the community through the transfer from public hands to private hands of a major utility. If you sell the asset, you no longer have any return to owners via dividends. If you keep the asset, you improve its performance, make it more efficient and the return to the shareholders can go up. The value of the ongoing dividend stream is almost $2 billion per year. The value of another 16 per cent sale of Telstra is around $16 billion to $17 billion on current market prices. The net proceeds are likely to be in the order of $15 billion to $16 billion after costs. The interest saving at current bond levels is only $890 million per year.</para><para>As was said some two or three weeks ago, on this simple calculation alone, dividends forgone through the sale of Telstra equal interest savings to governments in only 11 years. So, out of the 16 per cent sale of Telstra, the community receives only something in the order of $980 million: $671 million already outlined and $300 million outlined in the last 24 hours. Those dividends of $2 billion per year in a growth telco market are sacrifices for a mere 11 years of 
 interest savings plus the one-off social bonus. Even that bribe is fairly miserable. It spreads the benefit in five separate areas. Everyone thinks they are getting a slice of the pie, but it is a one-off slice only, directed particularly at one small state. Even the extra bonus of $300 million is not an additional cost to government, and I will return to that point later.</para><para>The general approach of the opposition to this bill is relatively simple. We will oppose every minor party amendment that seeks to improve the bill or make it more effective. We will support other amendments that are consistent with the opposition position of maintaining 66 per cent of Telstra in public hands. In this instance, we will support the deletion of schedule 3, which is the full sale, and the deletion of schedule 2, which is the sale of the next 16 per cent. Otherwise, the position of the opposition will be to oppose amendments from other parties that seek to improve or make more effective the passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5692</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Bishop for speaking, thus enabling me to get my thoughts sorted and not look as incompetent as I did about 15 minutes ago.

The evidence that has been given over time in relation to this bill and the inquiries associated with it clearly show that what we have done already has not lived up to the government's promises. Therefore, how can we assume that things will not continue in the same direction—that is, in the wrong direction in terms of accountability, consumer services and the whole way the market is operating? </para><para>Our amendment extends the reporting requirements to include notification of any reduction in service from rural or regional Australia or reduction in emergency services. This is a reasonable extension of the reporting requirements to cover the legitimate concerns that under a fully privatised Telstra or even a partially privatised Telstra there is a serious risk of undercutting rural and regional and emergency services.</para><para>In relation to rural and regional services, there has already been a steep service decline and reductions in employment. Over 17,000 jobs have been lost since partial privatisation, especially in rural and regional centres. Any significant reduction of services in a rural or regional centre is likely to have a major impact and is something that governments will have to plan for. It would be highly useful to know that in advance but, of course, under a privatised entity governments can then say it is not their doing.</para><para>In relation to emergency services, AAP reported that the manager of Telstra public safety, Ms Simpson, suggested in a response to a letter from ALP Senator Reynolds that Telstra may reduce its emergency role in the future. The response continued:</para><para>Telstra believes that the best provision of the emergency call service is to have callers answered by specialist emergency call takers who can provide immediate assistance to the caller.</para><para>That was written to Senator Reynolds in January. How does one translate `specialist emergency call takers'? My translation is that that is somewhere in a centralised office—maybe in one of the capital cities—where there is no local knowledge of the area involved. We know that in relation to emergency services that can mean the difference between life and death. `Specialist emergency call takers' is somebody's idea of economic efficiency where you allow for the fact that sometimes call takers in smaller regional areas are not available to take emergency calls all day. So it is more efficient to have a specialist taking emergency calls all day even if they do not know what to do with them when they get them.

We think the amendment is reasonable. I gather from the signals coming from the opposition that this is not the kind of amendment they can support, because it might make the passage of the bill easier. I certainly do not support the passage of the bill, but I can see that it might save some lives if we manage to get support for this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5693</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to echo the words of Senator Margetts in saying that we certainly do not support this bill either but we do think it is important—especially given the likelihood that there is going to be a sell-off of 16.6 per cent—to improve the bill.

At present Telstra must notify the minister of certain significant events—for example, the acquisition or disposal of significant business. This amendment will require Telstra to notify the minister if it substantially reduces services to rural and regional Austral 
 ia and if it reduces the provision of emergency services. We support this amendment because it is consistent with our concern about the level of services provided to those in rural and regional areas and because we think any reduction in the provision of emergency services should be drawn to the minister's attention.</para></talk.start><para>I must say it is disappointing to hear that the ALP do not intend to support this amendment or any others.

The amendment does go to reporting obligations to the minister if services are reduced in rural and regional Australia or if emergency services in rural and regional Australia are reduced by Telstra. I am not going to repeat my earlier comments. I think it is fairly clear that changes in service levels, reductions in service levels in Tasmania and indeed in wide parts of our country have been occurring for the last 18 to 24 months. That is no secret and it is on the public record.</para></talk.start><para>It is on the public record because, every quarter and every half, the ACA issues a monitoring review on the level of service carried out by Telstra and a range of other carrier providers—Optus and other competitors around Australia. Every quarter, the government, the opposition and the minor parties review those public reports, engage in discussion and debate here and pursue the issues that should be pursued in the various forums that are available to us, either in the various inquiries, in the estimates processes or through questions on notice.</para><para>The reason the opposition have highlighted this consistently for almost three years since the coalition came into government is that we have noted the declining level of services across the board—whether it be linesmen attending private homes in cities, linesmen 
 and technicians attending to problems in bush areas, or linesmen and technicians replacing services that break down because of natural occurrences. We said, when the first one-third was privatised, that service levels would decline.</para><para>We said that because we knew—from a range of academic literature, from our own intuition and from a range of reports that have been in the public domain on the efficient operation of telcos in the Western world—what happens when they are privatised or partly privatised. They have been privatised or partly privatised in Canada, parts of the US, the United Kingdom, right across Western Europe and in New Zealand. Without exception, when those dominant telco carriers were privatised and the government of the particular country reviewed the quality of operations of the new institution, service levels in each of those countries had declined. It was not a one-off decline, it declined gradually and continued to decline over time.</para><para>So, when the first one-third was privatised, we said then—and the relevant Senate committee at that time made a finding—that service levels would decline, and nothing in the last three years has changed that. You did not have to be a Rhodes scholar to figure out that one of the methods of increasing value in a corporation, maintaining a high dividend flow and returning an increasing proportion of that dividend flow to shareholders was to reduce costs. The obvious way to reduce costs is to reduce the composition and number of persons employed—that is, to directly reduce labour costs. It is a direct transfer from employees via the corporation to shareholders. It is out in the public domain that Telstra has an agreement and is in the process of implementing an agreement that something in the order of 20,000 or 25,000 employees will be, or have been, retrenched in a two-year period starting from this time last year. That is no big secret.</para><para>Now, 25,000 employees off the payroll is a huge labour cost saving. I acknowledge that they have not been sacked and thrown on the scrap heap. There has been a very generous redundancy payment made to each of those employees, and many of them have gone out 
 as independent contractors and have turned up in competitors or in other parts of the telecommunications industry. Nonetheless, the savings to Telstra have been dramatic, and the labour costs savings directly correlate to the reduction in services. It has been no secret. We predicted it. Overseas experience showed that it would happen. It was a finding of the Senate committee that this would happen, and it has occurred.</para><para>To have an amendment that the corporation advise the minister in writing of a substantial reduction in services strikes the opposition as stating the blindingly obvious. It is occurring. We know it is occurring. Employees tell us so every day of the week. At every estimates, the officials from Telstra do not hide the fact. It is government and Telstra policy to reduce labour costs, to reduce service levels and to transfer the gain to shareholders via dividend.</para><para>The amendment that has been circulated—whilst it has worthy intentions, and I do not quarrel with that—is in some respects a non sequitur. The best way, the only way, to turn around the ongoing decline in service levels is to oppose the sale of the next 16 per cent and the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra. If that is achieved, Telstra can be directed by government to establish guidelines—which can be checked—to improve service levels, call-out times, fixing of fault times and new line times. These are relatively easy things to do, but those services can only be offered and made mandatory on an ongoing basis when the government of the day so directs Telstra. It can only do that effectively if the 66 per cent of Telstra remains in public hands.</para><para>As I said in my opening remarks, once you go to 49 per cent—33 plus 16—that is the end of the story. The gate is open. It will be virtually impossible to return Telstra into public hands. To seek to improve the bill is to give a tick to the government's intent. The government is not backward about saying that. It went to the people on it. It was not shy about it. It is its policy. But it is not the position of the Australian Labor Party to encourage or to give authority to continuing reductions in service levels by Telstra. We say that the best way that that can be avoided is for Telstra to remain in public hands.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>5695</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I might indicate the attitude of the government. I welcome Senator Bishop's acknowledgment that this amendment will not be supported by the opposition. In fact, I think it is quite right of Senator Bishop to point out the logical deficiency.

What does achieve it, however, are the provisions that are already embedded in legislation, requiring adherence to universal service obligations and, of course, the customer service guarantee arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>Irrespective of any change in ownership—and, indeed, under the current arrangements—Telstra could not significantly reduce regional and rural services without infringing against the universal service plan which it has to lodge. The minister is able to require Telstra to vary the plan if it even sought to significantly reduce those services. Therefore, there is no need to require Telstra in that regard. The current arrangements relate to the interests of the minister in his shareholder role—that is, in matters to do with changes in corporate strategy; it is not to do with service levels.</para><para>We do not accept the mythology that Senator Bishop and his colleagues seek to perpetuate: that privatisations around the world have inevitably been accompanied by reductions in quality of service. The US, for example, has never had publicly owned telcos—so there is no evidence that you can point to there—but has always had universal service obligations and universal service level arrangements. There is nothing to stop the parliament from tightening those requirements, as we did recently. It is now possible for the ACA to require a remedial direction under clause 118 of this bill and to seek to have court imposed penalties if directions are not complied with, so we think we have covered all of those bases.</para><para>Everyone knows that Mr Beazley was the very minister who promised Mr Blount that, if he came out and took the job as CEO of Telstra, the Labor Party would privatise the company. And why wouldn't they? As Cheryl 
 Kernot said, `I'm not worried about what Labor might do in opposition; it is what they might do in government that worries me.' And she is dead right, because we all know this is a strategy of convenience on the part of the Labor Party. The delivery of an effective 000 service, again, is simply not dependent upon the goodwill of Telstra; many other service providers have a role to play. The legislation does provide for emergency call service arrangements that meet community expectations in a multicarrier environment.</para><para>We already have arrangements in place to ensure that the ACA monitors industry-wide compliance, and it is incumbent on Telstra to inform the ACA of any proposed changes. Indeed, Senator Ian Campbell recently wrote to the ACA asking it to increase its 000 monitoring and reporting activities in the light of proposed Telstra changes and concerns about effective deployment of mobile location capabilities. The ACA is considering adding a formal requirement to the emergency call service determination. If the intention of this amendment is that Telstra should notify the minister whenever it proposes to close a depot, a work management centre or a store, not only would it be an inappropriate proposal but it would be unnecessary and a waste of time and effort for both the minister and for Telstra.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5696</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a number of questions to put to Senator Alston in relation to employment issues in regional Australia and, specifically, Tasmania.

It has been reported in the media today that Senator Harradine holds out some hope that that may occur, so perhaps the minister could advise precisely what arrangements are in place for Telstra internally and in Tasmania and, secondly, what commitments have been given in relation to existing job levels.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5696</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought this was already a matter of public record, but the fact is that Telstra has given an undertaking—and that certainly has been communicated to Senator Harradine—that its consumer and customer arrangements will involve a separate regional area for Tasmania.

Part of the criticism which Senator Harradine has consistently made is that, if it is simply seen as part of regional Victoria, then there is much more of an inclination to centralise services in Victoria rather than to look at Tasmania on a statewide basis. Otherwise, these are operational matters. The important thing is that what is put before the CEO is a Tasmanian perspective, not a Greater Victoria perspective. On that basis, there will be every opportunity for a dedicated proposition to be put forward representing Tasmania's interests rather than Greater Victoria's interests.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>5696</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I am still not sure exactly what is meant by the Telstra commitment or your commitment in relation to Tasmania becoming a single region or a single area.

Until now, Telstra has treated each state separately, with the exception that it has treated Tasmania—commercial and consumer—as part of regional Victoria. This undertaking involves reverting to a situation where Tasmania stands on its own feet. It has someone in charge with that statewide perspective only and able to argue the case for Tasmania. I think that is what Senator Harradine and others have sought—that instead of seeing Tasmania simply as part of Greater Victoria, it is seen as having its own stand-alone arrangement. Therefore, it gives Tasmania a much greater opportunity to argue its case on its merits rather than being treated as part of a perhaps more efficient overall viewpoint. It gives Tasmania the standing that would equate it with all other states. No other state is treated any differently as a result of this arrangement.

It is not treated differently now under this new regime. Commercial and consumer for Tasmania is the same as for any other state. That does not mean that there are any necessary employment or other consequences for Tasmania, nor for any of the other states. It is simply an operational management approach that provides the opportunity for each state to argue its own case rather than simply having to put in a submission to Victoria and hope that somehow Tasmania's views are taken fully into account.

That is what I understand you to say, but I am not quite sure precisely what being a `separate area' means if that is the case, other then being able to articulate your case more directly to Dr Switkowski rather than having to go via the Victorian manager. So if it has no operational effect and it has no employment effect, it seems a bit of a chimera in terms of any commitment given in relation to the package.</para></talk.start><para>On the second issue, Minister, I am stunned that you need to seek further advice in relation to correspondence that was sent to you about three months ago in relation to staffing levels in Tasmania. Firstly, I ask you to reconsider your initial comments. Are you sure that it has no operational or employment significance in terms of Tasmania? If it does, what are they? Secondly, is it the case or not that since 1996 the decline in full-time employees in Tasmania has been of the order of 350? We have asked you this question many times, but we have not got a response in estimates hearings, to questions on notice or from direct correspondence to you, so I am seeking this opportunity to find out precisely what the status of staffing in Tasmania is.

This was a decision made by Telstra. It was a decision conveyed to me, at all events, in writing by the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra. In fact, this will not be a chimera. Senator Mackay is making assumptions which are not there. You are putting words into the minister's mouth that I at least did not hear him say. I do not think that is appropriate in the committee stage of a debate, nor, indeed, in the second reading stage. With regard to that particular position, it will recognise Tasmania as a separate entity in that particular area—a major area—rather than as a Victorian country region. In addition to the appointment of that manager, there will be a support team of at least five people for that particular operation; and that has been conveyed to me by Telstra.</para></talk.start><para>I am interested to hear Senator Mackay asking questions about employment in Tasmania. She ought to know—and I ask her to get up and deny this—that, in respect of job adjustments and job losses, other states have fared much worse than Tasmania in actual terms and in percentage terms over the last three or four years, despite the fact that a decline was commencing even then. I ask her to get up and deny that. She has not had any hand in trying to protect the jobs of Tasmanians in Telstra itself. In fact, she is part of an organisation, the Labor Party, which supported very strongly the deregulation of the industry.</para><para>I had independent advice given to me. I asked what was causing the effect on employment in Telstra in mainland states of Australia and in Tasmania. In summary, the response was:</para><para>. Telecommunications is a very high growth industry.</para><para>. While its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved (particularly Telstra) are significant employers.</para><para>. But as the industry becomes more capital intensive (eg through the elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on the traditional copper wire infrastructure) it is to be 
 expected that employment growth will ease or actually decline.</para><para>. Easing off in Telstra's employment growth since 1996 is a response to deregulation to the extent that Telstra has lost market share in the long-distance markets.</para><para>. Too early to say what impact privatisation has had on Telstra employment, but the predominant influences on Telstra employment have been the impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.</para><para>Forget about all of the argument that Senator Mackay has been carrying on with in Tasmania. Let her face the facts—and those are the facts. The independent advice that I have received was that the predominant reasons for job losses are the deregulatory environment, the new players coming into the field, together with advances in technological change. I think we have to face the situation realistically. In those circumstances, you have to try to look at the area where you are best suited. Those areas have been identified, and there has been considerable work done on getting alternative job opportunities within Telstra as well as outside Telstra for persons in the communications industry.</para><para>I am not here to talk much about what has transpired over the last few months with respect to negotiations. All I do say is that I acknowledge that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has had a considerable interest in what happens in regional and rural Australia and, particularly, he has a great interest in the state of Tasmania. But in pursuing that interest, the minister has not disadvantaged other areas within Australia. In fact, I pay credit to him for bumping up the social bonus from $671 million to $1 billion. I think that is an action that the minister took having regard to the importance that he and indeed his government place on rural and regional Australia in the area of communications. I am aware of the Prime Minister's view and the views of a number of ministers, including the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, on this.</para><para>I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the work done by Telstra and various government departments—both federal and state, Senator Mackay. I believe that the considerable amount of work that this 
 involved has resulted in a substantial improvement on what we were first faced with in this chamber in the bill that is currently before us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>5699</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The first point I would make in response to Senator Harradine is that it is not me that is voting for a further 16 per cent sell down of Telstra, nor was it the Labor Party that supported the one-third sale in relation to the first tranche.

He may have independent advice. I have certainly never seen that. I do not know where it came from. We have sought information from the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on many occasions going to precisely the matters that Senator Harradine has raised. It is not on for him to get to his feet and demand that the opposition deny or confirm information when we have not been allowed access to that information. We have in fact attempted, even through Telstra's government liaison department, to get that information.</para><para>As I indicated, in absolute desperation the opposition wrote to Minister Alston on 26 March posing a series of questions, attempting to get answers to the sort of thing that Senator Harradine is alluding to. Let me tell you some of the questions that we asked, which we have not got a response to—but here we are being lambasted by Senator Harradine for daring to question the orthodoxy when we do not have any information on which to base any analysis. Let me put on the record a couple of the questions that we asked Senator Alston which he found so difficult that to date he has been unable to respond. They include really tough stuff like how many full-time equivalent staff Telstra currently employs in Tasmania. I would have thought the minister for communications might have known that 
 one. A second one asks for provision of a breakdown of the current full-time, part-time and casual Telstra employment figures in Tasmania by location and by function—not a difficult one if you are the minister for communications, I would have thought. We also asked for a breakdown of full-time, part-time and casual Telstra employment figures in Tasmania by location and by function as at March 1996.</para><para>The opposition was attempting to determine whether or not Senator Harradine is correct in his assertion that job losses occurred as a result of the deregulation and to determine what has in fact happened since this government came into power in 1996. We do know, Senator Harradine, and so do you, that a substantial proportion of the job shedding in Telstra happened prior to the first tranche sale, in preparation for the first tranche sale. I know that that is certainly the view of the people on the ground in Tasmania. So it is a bit rich to get up in here and say to the opposition that we are not admitting one particular thing when we have made strenuous attempts to get precisely the information that Senator Harradine is referring to, and we are still in the dark. We still do not have these answers. I am sure Senator Alston would be quite grateful to Senator Harradine for at least providing some illumination in relation to some of the employment consequences of the one area proposal. At least we know now that there is going to be a manager and at least we know now that there are going to be five support staff for that manager. That is good; at least we know that. But in relation to the rest of it, if that is all there is, let us hear that, Minister. But if there is more, we would like to know the answers.</para><para>I say again that we have put a number of propositions to you. This is the committee stage in relation to the privatisation of this instrumentality, and the parliament and the people of Tasmania now deserve answers, including answers to correspondence that has remained unanswered for three months. So I ask those questions again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>5699</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note with interest that 
 Senator Mackay did not respond to several matters that Senator Harradine put on the record. They were, in particular, that Senator Mackay had not tried to protect jobs in Telstra in Tasmania and that she belongs to an organisation which supported the deregulation of the industry. I take her non-denial as quite significant in that context.</para></talk.start><para>I think the more important issue is that we are here debating the merits or otherwise of further privatisation of Telstra. Senator Mackay knows full well that the reduction in employment levels has been an ongoing issue for many years. In fact, back in the early 1990s Telstra had something like 93,000 employees. Well before 1996—I think it was probably about 1994—they set a target of something like 55,000, and they are on track to meet that. The reason they did it was that by independent assessments they were something like 30 per cent off world's best practice, by any of the conventional measures, whether it was the lines per employee or revenue per employee. Telstra, like anyone else who has been corporatised, as Telstra were by Mr Beazley when he was the minister for communications in 1991, are required to operate as efficiently as possible. Like any other corporation, if they are padded and they have inefficiencies in the system, they have an obligation to shareholders to correct those. To the extent that they are required to meet other legislative obligations such as a universal service requirement or customer service guarantee levels or anything else, they have to have those in mind before they proceed with any reductions.</para><para>The fact is, of course, that to ask a question about March 1996 is simply to pick a date of convenience which ignores the reality that reductions in employment in Telstra have been ongoing and precede 1996. In fact, Senator Mackay said that; she said that much of the job reductions occurred before the first tranche. But, of course, you like to say that was in preparation for it. It was not in preparation for it at all, and you well know it. Telstra did not know that we were going to win the 1996 election, presumably. They might have had every reason to think that if you won it you would privatise Telstra, but 
 they did not recognise the extent to which Mr Beazley would welsh on his promise.</para><para>The fact remains that this has been a growth industry. The communications sector has been growing at something like three times the rate of GNP. There are other carriers who have come into the marketplace in Tasmania. Optus and Vodafone have both been very active there. Indeed, as Senator Mackay would well know, the recently announced Vodafone call centre in Hobart will provide something in the order of 450 jobs in the not too distant future and I think there is a target of close to 700.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Full time, part time or casual?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—Again, it is convenient for you to characterise call centres as sweatshops, because that is the union line. They obviously resent the fact that a lot of these people are not particularly inclined to take up union membership. Of course, they are not Robinson Crusoe in that regard. It is happening across the board. The fact is that many more jobs have been created in the wider communications sector, so the mere fact that jobs might flow out of Telstra does not mean anything. It simply means that Telstra has become more efficient. Those people may well be taken up in other sectors of the industry and overall job levels in communications may well be rising. So to take a selective snapshot of Telstra's employment tells you absolutely nothing about whether the citizens of Tasmania are better served as a result of that restructuring.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think I heard Senator Mackay allege that since 1996 there has been a decline of about 350 jobs.

 post 30 June 1999. Can you please confer with Telstra and establish whether that is the case? If you are not prepared to, we will have to pursue that through other avenues.

If you get up, as you probably will, and say that that is a matter for Telstra, that you do not know and how on earth are you, as the mere minister for communications, expected to actually have answers to these questions then I have to say, Minister, your entire arrangement with Senator Harradine is questionable, to say the least. Either you know this information or you do not. If you do not know the information, that is fine, but you as minister for communications ought to be able to give me, as a senator for Tasmania—there are a number of senators for Tasmania here—an assurance that those jobs are not in jeopardy.

In other words, to the extent that the ACA wants to keep records of Tasmania as a separate state then it would already be doing that. This might indeed facilitate that but I do not see, if the ACA were minded to have Tasmania-wide stats, that it could not ask for them and be already using them. So, although I do not have an example of the way in which those statistics are provided, I would be very surprised if this particular decision would make much difference to the ACA.

We had some most extraordinary statements from the minister which it would be interesting to compare with the statements he made, when we were dealing with the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, indicating how ridiculous 
 it would be if people asked questions in the future about what was going on in Telstra and he could not respond, considering that the government had majority ownership. And he has just proven his own point back then, that he actually indicated to the Senate it would be ridiculous if the government did not have some say over the way telecommunications were provided in Australia. The most basic of information, he says, is too difficult because he does not want to provide it and it is something that can only be given by Telstra.</para></talk.start><para>Our amendment removes the sale provisions relating to the further 16.6 per cent on the basis that the Greens are opposed to any further sale of Telstra. But we are fully supportive of the measures to improve customer standards. Consequently, we are supportive of the elements that amalgamate customer service standards. The opposition to the further sale of Telstra is mounting from all fronts. Firstly, under competition, 10 groups including all other major telcos—Cable and Wireless, Optus, AAPT, Macquarie Corporate, Global One, One.Tel, Powertel, Primus, MCI-Worldcom, World Change and BT Australia—have warned that the further sale will exacerbate Telstra's already aggressive and anticompetitive behaviour. That is funny; I thought we were going into markets. We are warned that the market is nowhere near competitive and that market regulation is required to put a brake on this huge near-monopoly exerting immense market power. But of course, in order to make the sale more attractive to possible buyers and shareholders, the government removed a lot of the protections, so instead of re-regulating they removed a lot of regulations.</para><para>In terms of economic arguments, there is Telstra's record of recording huge profits. In the six months ending 31 December, it made another record profit of $1.8 billion—12.2 per cent up on the previous corresponding period—and that is even more reason to keep it in public hands so that all Australians can share in these profits and the dividends can be applied to social and environmental programs benefiting all Australians. And with social and customer services, the decline in service since the partial privatisation is, of course, very 
 well documented. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that this situation is likely to be exacerbated by privatising Telstra in the absence of a highly competitive environment. So the question is: did the government's assertions about the first part of the privatisation come true about our unnecessary fears? Quite frankly, if anything, I suppose our fears were not as bad as they ought to have been.</para><para>The Greens (WA) are opposing part of schedule 2 as set out at (5) on sheet 1267:</para><para>(5)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (line 2) to page 31 (line 31), <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline> .</para><para>Quite frankly, the government's promises, assertions and so on have not come to fruition. This is something that affects all Australia. It is not a matter of little packages for particular areas of Australia; it is about the quality of telecommunications, the quality and ongoing quality of regional and rural Australia's life, and it is about whether or not the government's assurances are worth the paper they are written on. Like last time, it quite clearly does not appear that they are. Therefore, why should the Senate give the government the benefit of the doubt twice when the evidence manifestly has indicated that their reassurances have not been delivered in relation to the last sale of Telstra? So I would seek the support of the chamber in relation to this. I hope the indications that were given earlier by Senator Bishop extend to support for this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5705</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment.

We take the view that the social bonus is by no means going to solve all of the problems in terms of telecommunications for rural and remote areas but it is a start. So we agree with the opposition to the sale of any more of the government's interest in Telstra but we believe that a social bonus should be paid and that it should be paid out of the dividend 
 stream that the government receives from Telstra.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats are very concerned about communications in regional and rural Australia and we would like to see a systematic program of upgrading services, governed by a well-planned strategy to as closely as possible reach equality of services between rural Australia and cities. Consequently, we do not think that the social bonus program is ideal—and there are a number of questions that I want to put to the minister about that program—but again it is a start. The next amendment is the Democrat amendment that opposes the further 16.6 per cent sale but which will retain the social bonus and pay that $670 million out of dividends.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>5705</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Legislation </title><page.no>5705</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5705</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

Most Australians understand the benefits that would flow from some $12 billion of income tax reductions and the incentives that lie within. Most Australians appreciate the benefits of getting rid of an inefficient and complex wholesales sales tax system. Most Australians recognise the benefits in removing poverty traps which are inherent within this legislative package. Most Australians recognise the importance of supporting exports. Even Senator Cook should appreciate that, from some of his questions. Most Australians recognise that some two-thirds of the economy is now service related and, if we are to have the funds necessary to meet government responsibilities in the future in relation to health, education and other such matters, there will need to be an expansion of the tax base. Services is an obvious area. Again, I would have thought that even Senator Cook could appreciate that.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from all of these advantages of the tax reform package that are so well appreciated and apart from the fact that it is well acknowledged that, for pensioners, compensation exceeds any additional cost, and now substantially exceeds any additional cost, the revelations at the weekend were also interesting because they showed how many families will benefit from the new taxation system as opposed to the current system—not just an 
 additional benefit between the revised model and the former model, but benefits over the existing taxation system. In particular, the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> pointed out that a family with a dual income of $60,000 and three children will be $20 a week better off under the new taxation system. A family with a single income of $35,000 and three children will be $75 a week better off. These are substantial gains for families in these circumstances.</para><para>All Australians, apart perhaps from the very wealthy, can benefit from this tax reform package. One would have thought that in such circumstances it would be embraced by the Australian Labor Party, but of course it is not. The Australian Labor Party, as acknowledged by Senator Sherry, does not even have a taxation policy.

Now he has changed his position again and is telling us, `If the GST is in place and Labor comes to government, we'll start to wind back parts of the GST.' Apparently, you can unscramble the egg. If the Australian Labor Party had the courage of their current stance, they would get up and say, `If we came to government, we would get rid of it.' But no, they want it both ways all the time.

In most instances, these are capital items.</para></talk.start><para>I was particularly fascinated to see just before question time started that the Australian Democrats had the strategic cunning to say that they supported our social bonus initiatives but wanted them paid for out of the dividend stream. That money is already applied to hospitals and schools and to other worthy social causes. At least the Democrats showed a glimmer of intelligence because they are not out there bagging these very important initiatives. Yet what do we find from the Labor Party? We find blanket opposition, with Mr Beazley out there once again saying, `This is a massive bribe.' What sort of message does that send to rural Australia? It tells them that the Labor Party is simply opposed to a billion dollars worth of social bonus as a major investment in Australia's information future.</para><para>Of course, the $70 million Building Additional Rural Networks program will enable communities in rural Australia to take more responsibility for their own advanced communications needs. Each state receives $10 million and the territories get $10 million between them. Labor is absolutely opposed. A $45 million local government fund will 
 ensure that regional Australia can provide services online and provide public Internet access for communities. The $158 million Building on IT Streams program will provide a major stimulus to the IT and telecommunications network sectors. There will be an IT business incubator in each state and territory. These are all terribly important ways of ensuring that people have access to the latest technology and that small and medium enterprises are able to test particular programs to get the necessary start-up advice. It is an obvious thing to do but quite costly. Obviously, money has to be provided from the proceeds of the sale of Telstra.</para><para>But what is the Labor Party's attitude? It is blanket opposition; they are not interested. They do not address the needs of rural Australia, do not even say whether you think it is important and do not even say, `Yes, but we cannot find the money from somewhere else.' No, it is just blanket opposition. This really comes to the fore when you look at our Intelligent Island proposals in relation to Tasmania. Successive state Labor and Liberal governments have recognised that Tasmania's best chance by far of escaping out of continuing economic decline is to follow the New Brunswick model, to try to transform Tasmania into an Intelligent Island, to ensure it has access to all the telephone and Internet services that ought to be available and that businesses are properly plugged in.</para><para>What does the federal Labor Party do? It says, `No.' It disagrees with its state colleagues. And why does it do that? It does it for ideological reasons. It wants to run this line that it privatised everything in sight when it was in government, but the one thing it will not privatise is Telstra. Well of course we all know that is complete rubbish. We all know Mr Beazley promised Mr Blount that he would privatise Telstra when he invited him to come to Australia and we know from Cheryl Kernot that Labor would privatise Telstra as quick as a flash if it came to government. So all we find is the Labor Party sending out the message that it is opposed to an additional $250 million to protect the environment and a whole raft of social bonus initiatives that can be only of tremendous 
 benefit largely to people outside the metropolitan areas.

In relation to the latter, prime ministers have from time to time set standards which they have reduced to writing and in some instances, and in the instance of Mr Howard, those standards have been made public. Of course, he can be challenged politically on the question of whether they are adequate, whether they are in the form that individual parliamentarians in their role of scrutiny, of seeking to hold the executive accountable, might think are sufficient. So it seems to me that that really is a responsibility of the Prime Minister. Similarly, the issue as to whether ministers and parliamentary secretaries et cetera—members of the executive—comply with those guidelines is an issue for the Prime Minister, although again obviously subject to the critical pressure of members of parliament, as we have seen exhibited from time to time and again during the last sitting fortnight. So the distinction should be drawn between the role of the Prime Minister in his responsibility for the executive and the role of the parliament in ensuring the responsibility of its own members and senators. Thus, it would seem to me that it would not be appropriate for the parliament as a whole to be determining for the Prime Minister what the executive standards should be or what the form of those standards should be.

I therefore do not really see that the introduction of an independent commissioner is necessary; it is almost a vote of no-confidence in the capacity of the parliament to hold the executive accountable.

I may be corrected on this but, as I understand it, under the Western Australian Heritage Protection Act it is an offence to desecrate an Aboriginal sacred site, and therefore perhaps the form of the Western Australian legislation is satisfactory and to a standard that we might well expect to be desirable. But the issue then becomes whether the implementation of the act is of a similar standard. As I recall it, part of the debate before Justice Evatt and in the other parliamentary committee assessments of the proposed changes to the Commonwealth's Aboriginal heritage protection regime concerned whether accreditation of the state laws also required some form of accreditation of the state practices.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I think this is an interesting case study that is well worth examination. The comment I saw from the state minister in the article was that the evidence had not been advanced to justify or support a prosecution. The issue is then raised as to whose responsibility it should be to seek out such evidence and therefore provide the basis for a prosecution. Certainly, I gather from what Senator Margetts is saying that her advocacy is for the position that, when a complaint is made, the state should be proactive and should investigate—as might apply to any other alleged breach of criminal law—and that, if evidence does justify such an action, a prosecution should then be launched.</para><para>Why I say it is an interesting case study is that it in fact might help to either prove or disapprove the arguments that were put before Justice Evatt and that will of course be debated in this place a little later this year. Unfor 
 tunately, Senator Margetts is unlikely to be with us a little later this year but, by asking this question today, she has made sure that we are all aware of this particular issue and that it will be properly debated and dealt with in this place. Certainly, we wish the piece of law that will be enacted hopefully later this year to be effective. Everyone accepts that there are major deficiencies in the existing Commonwealth law in relation to the protection of Aboriginal heritage sites.</para><para>There has been a lot of advice and study on what reforms are necessary. Most of the advice has been taken up within the existing bill. The only part where I disagree with what Senator Margetts has said is in the final bit, where she said that all Aboriginal groups are opposed to the proposed reforms. All Aboriginal groups are in fact calling for reform. There is debate over the detail of that reform. Most of what has been sought by the Aboriginal groups has in fact been accepted. There are still some areas of disagreement, and they will no doubt be the subjects of the detailed debate that will take place in the Senate later this year. I am confident, Senator Margetts, that out of it will come Commonwealth legislation that will be not only an improvement on that which exists at the moment but also effective in the way that you seek.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5712</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I have a supplementary question.

Senator Calvert is, as usual, dead right. Australia's economy has been praised by many independent commentators of late. For example, Professor Paul Krugman, a professor in economics at MIT, described our economy as the `miracle economy'. He went on to say that he would like to see `more Australias around the world' because Australia's internal strength and its appropriate policy mix meant that its appearance of vulnerability `did not result in any crisis at all'. This is entirely true and is the result of sound management of the economy by this government. Another commentator, Professor Ross Garnaut, who would be well known to many senators, also praised our economic performance, stating:</para></talk.start><para>The third era is the one that I believe we may now be entering because we are enjoying at the present time levels of economic stability and economic predictability, the like of which I haven't experienced at any time over the last 30 years.</para><para>Not surprisingly, I happen to agree with him. The economic conditions Australia is now experiencing are unprecedented. Indeed, it is very clear that Australia is entering a third era of sustained economic growth.

About inflation, he said:</para><para>If our inflation forecast is at or in the bag, then there isn't a prima facie indication for adjustment to Australian monetary policy.</para><para>Along with the Reserve Bank Governor's opinion is the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer survey, showing consumer sentiment as `remarkably resilient'—in fact, now 18 per cent above levels of a year ago and 11.5 per cent above the first six months of 1998. A majority of consumers now see their finances to be in better shape than a year ago and are also more optimistic about finances over the next 12 months. Let me quote briefly from the survey:</para><para>The consolidation of strong consumer sentiment indicates that the recent surge in consumer spending can be sustained further into 1999.</para><para>Last week Citibank released a press release headed `Home loans go through the roof again', so it is not just the government and independent commentators trumpeting the success of the Australian economy; Australians are voting with their feet.

The problem of course is that the original Snowy Mountains scheme very substantially altered the whole of the environmental aspect of both the Murray and the Snowy. Negotiations are continuing between Victoria and New South Wales. As I recall, submissions are currently being made on the report that has been tabled and the matter will be progressed.

I was delighted yesterday to join with my colleague Senator Alston in announcing a new $45 million local government fund called Local Government Online. As far as communications is concerned, that fund will take rural councils off the dusty outback track and onto the telecommunications superhighway. Local government in rural and regional Australia will be able to put essential documents, such as planning applications, online. This fund will also allow for a one-stop shop for planning and business approvals, for registrations and for those sorts 
 of things that local councils deal with all the time. It will allow local councils to develop local community and business capability resources and will allow for online community consultation on development proposals. This fund, which is very good news for regional Australia and for local government in particular, will allow local government to provide new telecommunication services for their communities. Local government, utilising current infrastructure and facilities, will be able to extend the range of telecommunications services within their communities through things like public access points.</para></talk.start><para>This fund will be available on application. I will be talking with state and territory governments and with state based local government associations to develop the specific guidelines for this program. It is hoped that this program will enable new services to be introduced, such as Internet based local government service delivery, public access points—as I have mentioned—using advanced technology, and satellite phone services in some more remote communities, particularly those currently outside the mobile range. It will allow these smaller communities to have videoconferencing facilities and it will enable improved and more affordable access to telephone based local government information services.</para><para>For those of my colleagues, opposition members and minor party members who live in the capital cities, a lot of these things are currently available in the big councils—the councils that are, of historical necessity, wealthier—but this new initiative by this federal government makes these latest online technologies available to all Australians. As such, it is a huge step forward, and one of the things that the Howard government has been committed to doing; that is, making sure rural and regional Australians have access to these services.</para><para>This fund adds to the other initiatives that we have. There is a $20 million program which allows for improved telecommunications in remote and isolated island communities, which is particularly good for the external territories of Australia and also those island parts of Queensland. It adds to the $1 
 billion fund which we will be setting up as well out of the social bonus from the sale of the next 16 per cent of Telstra to expand mobile phone coverage along the nation's busiest highways and in regional centres. That is the sort of activity that regional Australians need more than anything else to make them part of Australia, to allow them to share in the great advances that are happening in the country at the moment and to allow them to be part of the progress that the Australian economy is achieving. It will also add to our great initiative on the rural transaction centres.

Here we have an excellent example of everything that is going wrong with respect to the GST proposal. Under the current taxation regime books are not taxed. In fact, they have not been subject to a wholesale sales tax either. For the first time, under the government's GST proposal books will be taxed, and taxed at 10 per cent. 
 Despite various bold statements by the Democrats leading up to the election, they are not prepared to extend themselves to seek a tax-free regime for books into the future.</para><para>There are a couple of significant issues that must be addressed here. First of all, books are symbolic of knowledge in our community. They are symbolic of where we go in terms of educating our young people and about allowing everyone to participate in, to use the words the government was so keen to put on the record today, an intelligent community. In fact, there is no doubt that books are more than just symbols; they are a mechanism for us to share knowledge. With respect to books in this country, I am talking about the opportunities for families and individuals to purchase books and the impact on their expendable incomes. Through the inquiry process, we know that when a GST of seven per cent was introduced in Canada that resulted in a 12 per cent drop in retail book sales. What can we expect here in Australia? What kind of decline in book sales do we have to look forward to once a GST has been put in place?</para><para>Another aspect is those who actually sell books, the independent retailers in this country. I recall the concerns that many of those suppliers of books in this country had leading up to the 1998 election about the viability of their business. Generally these people are operating small businesses, and changes like that 12 per cent shift that was experienced in Canada could mean the difference between the business living or dying over the next few years. So there is an issue also about the viability of business going into the future for those who actually endeavour to participate in the retail sector in the sale of books.</para><para>A further aspect is those who produce books. There are various ranges of contributors to this process, the first and foremost being the authors themselves, the writers. Certainly what appears to be the case with regard to the GST is that the government will reap far more from the collection of a GST on books than indeed any writers and authors will reap from the contribution of their intellectual property, their commitment and their endeavour that they put forward so that we in the community can actually share those 
 thoughts and those views. What sort of place will we be living in where those who are the creative substance behind books will be extracting a far smaller proportion of revenues arising from that contribution than the government will through an imposed taxation regime?</para><para>It is interesting to see how the Democrats rhetoric changes, isn't it? I actually recall, in raising this issue leading up to the 1998 campaign, the vehemence with which the Democrats were opposing this particular aspect of the tax. That action aligned itself with what they claimed as their principles and their commitment to education. I recall the words `a tax on education' being a catchcry at that time for all parties who were opposing the tax. But, as we have seen both at the midpoint of the federal election campaign and more recently, the Democrats have suddenly lost their commitment to opposing this particular aspect of the tax.</para><para>I would also like to address the issue of online book sales. More than anywhere else, here the GST is a tax for times past. You cannot impose a GST on books that are purchased from overseas locations through the Internet. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>5719</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again we hear Senator Lundy big on words and very little on substance.

Senator Lundy lives in the past. She claims to talk about new 
 technology and the wonderful advantages it has for our community and for the young people in our community, yet she is prepared to tax those people to the hilt. What we will have in relation to books is a new tax—a GST—which will not be 10 per cent because, as we all know, there is nothing in any of today's society that will increase in price by 10 per cent once all the ramifications of a goods and services tax are put in place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Lundy then said she could quantify how much book sales were going to drop by, but she did not mention how much they were going to drop by. She just said that she knows there will be this enormous impact on booksellers and authors in Australia but then never said a thing about how much it would be. That is typical of the Labor Party's attitude to taxation. If you have no policy of your own, all you can do is to try to criticise a government that is trying to put in place a much fairer taxation system for the whole of Australia.</para><para>Not once did Senator Lundy mention the extra disposable income people will have in order to purchase books. In all of the arguments that Senator Lundy and the Labor Party have put forward, they have only ever talked about one side of the ledger. They have never talked about the income tax cuts and the increases in compensation for those on welfare and low incomes, or the extra income they are going to have to actually purchase the things that may rise slightly in price as a result of the introduction of a goods and services tax.</para><para>The Democrats understand it because they have actually gone into the process of trying to understand it. They did not come to this debate with a predetermined position, saying, `Whatever the government does, we will oppose it. In relation to the goods and services tax, it does not matter if it is better for the country; we will oppose it because we think that we can actually hoodwink the Australian community into thinking that it is bad for them.' Senator Lundy got her result of all of those actions at the last election. The Labor Party did not win government and, because they did not win government, they are now going to see this government, 
 through its negotiations with the Democrats, introduce a new taxation system for the whole of Australia which is going to benefit all Australians.</para><para>The research that has been done over the past week, which was published in the newspaper I think this morning, shows that no Australians will be worse off. You cannot say that about the Labor Party's tax policy for two reasons. Firstly, they do not have one. Secondly, if they carried on with the taxation arrangements that they had in place for the 13 years they were in government, there would be Australians who were worse off.</para><para>Senator Lundy gets up and cries crocodile tears about what is happening in relation to books, but she ought to put it into the whole perspective of what is happening with taxation reform. Do not just single out one small item; look at taxation reform and look at what it is going to do for the whole of the Australian community, not just one small sector. As I said before, if Senator Lundy took into account all of the benefits that are going to flow from the extra disposable income, she would find that books are going to be just as affordable after a GST is introduced as they are now.</para><para>When you talk about other countries where there maybe has been some effect on the purchase of some items, have a look at the compensation that those countries have offered to the average taxpayer in situations where they have introduced a GST. In many cases, no compensation was offered. The Labor Party never offered compensation either whenever they increased the wholesale sales tax. They never offered compensation so that people could actually have more purchasing power when it came to purchasing those items. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>5720</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Ferguson, I hope that people listening have taken note of your words that books will be just as affordable as they are now, because I think they will be monitoring that statement very closely in the future.

 Senator Kemp? One of the things that is most frustrating for listeners of question time is that we cannot get straight answers from ministers. I am afraid Senator Kemp is one of the worst offenders.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Kemp was asked specifically about the impact of the GST and the fact that people would be able to avoid the GST by using online purchasing. He talked very briefly, making one statement, about additional assistance to booksellers.

We rang his office and we rang several other offices, and nobody seems to know where it is. It is not available, as far as we can determine, on the Internet in the detail of ministerial statements.</para><para>So where is this additional assistance to booksellers? I hope that Senator Kemp will ensure that my office and the offices of all other senators receive the detail. Usually when a minister says, `Look, it's in a certain press statement,' my office can find it. I wanted it for this debate and it could not be found. I call on Senator Kemp to detail just what this additional assistance to booksellers is.</para><para>Last year, on 23 November in an exchange with Senator Conroy, Senator Kemp in a 1½-page statement about this issue could manage only a one-sentence response.

He will benefit from a better functioning economy.</para><para>Because I come from a regional area, I happen to know that booksellers are extremely concerned about the GST. They are extremely concerned about the fact that there has been a monopoly by some of the major book suppliers, particularly suppliers to schools.

To my knowledge we have not had in this place anything more definitive. It is all very well for Senator Ferguson to say, `The price of books may rise slightly, but books will be just as affordable.' He then talks about how we must not get too concerned about a small sector. I cannot understand why Senator Ferguson, who I am sure is concerned about education and literacy standards in this country, would regard books and a tax on books and knowledge as only applying to a small sector. The entire education sector, unions and parents are very concerned about this additional cost of books. Whatever modelling, whatever calculations you make—and I saw those calculations—there is still a concern about this tax on books. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>5721</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The previous speaker tells us that parents and others are very concerned about the rise in the price of books that is possibly coming.

We say that, rather than wind back all that Labor would have us do in carrying out that program, we need to go forward with this tax package.

But what it boils down to, as cold, hard facts for people listening, is that unfortunately, when Minister Kemp was actually asked to provide details about this tax package and the implications for the cost of books, he was unable to provide us with any detail. He talked about additional assistance to be given to the book industry but gave no detail. The Senate committee that I sat on heard numerous submissions from people around the country, in particular the Australian Booksellers Association and the Australian Publishers Association, and was provided with overwhelming evidence about the effect that the GST will have on the book industry.</para></talk.start><para>I want to answer some of the claims and to give some facts about price modelling and evidence from around the world. Australian books have never been subject to a sales tax. Books that you will find when you go into a bookseller have not been subject to a sales tax. In fact, if a GST is going to be imposed on books after a long history of them being free from sales tax, the effect will be that they will be much more expensive compared with other commodities. The Australian Publishers Association, appearing before our committee, said in its submission:</para><para>In various studies conducted around the world, particularly UK, USA, France and Ireland, it was found that the price elasticity of demand was approximately—1.0. If this were replicated in Australia (a country with similarities in historical and cultural values to the above countries), there would be a 4% increase in the price of books (according to the PRISMOD pricing model for the book publishing industry), accompanied by a reduction in demand of approximately 4%.</para><para>So we have evidence here of a price increase and a reduction in demand. Of the 19 major industrial nations around the world, 17 have either no tax or a reduced level of tax on books. We have had, in the last couple of weeks, major authors coming out and saying what they feel about a GST on books, including none other than the famous children's author Paul Jennings, who knows only too well and has captured perfectly well the market for which he writes. His books sell at the moment for less than $10, and they are affordable.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Are they educational?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name></talker><para>—Everything that you read must be educational, Senator McGauran, especially if you know anything about Paul Jennings's books. Kids love them. They soak them up and they cannot get enough of them. But, you see, the minute you put a 10 per cent tax on his book it goes over the $10 mark. One of the most amazing things that we found out in the GST committee was this: people talked to us about the $10 and the $20 thresholds and about people's willingness to buy a book for $9.95 or $19.95, but the minute the price goes over the next threshold there is a reluctance there.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian Publishers Association also provided us with a very interesting letter from the International Publishers Association. Their 24th congress, in 1992, moved this motion:</para><para>No government should impose any levy or tax, such as tariffs, sales tax, excise duties and VAT especially, on books, teaching aids, teaching materials . . . and other such accessories as are necessary for formal education.</para><para>That is from a renowned international publishers association. Similarly, the European Booksellers Federation has a large number of things to say—talking about the Australian Booksellers Association campaigning against a GST—about the fact that it is always `a regrettable necessity to undertake such campaigns, given the clear phrasing of the UNESCO Charter which strongly argues for there being "no taxation on knowledge"'. So we have Australian associations and international associations saying that a tax on books is a tax on knowledge. It is a tax on reading your little kids a bedtime story. It is a tax on a whole range of people who access books to further their education through their lifelong learning process. Reading a book is a key to unlocking literacy. It is a key to ascertaining how your language functions. It is a key to the knowledge of this world, whether it is a picture book, a fiction book, an encyclopedia or a book you use as a student in high school or in tertiary education. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>5723</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we have heard today has placed a lot of attention on one small aspect of the overall tax package which is going to be introduced, but we are forgetting the broader picture. We are forgetting the need to have substantial tax reform in the Australian economy. We had an absolutely moribund tax system which unfairly discriminated against people on low and middle incomes. We had a system of wholesale sales tax, introduced by the Labor Party—and I see Senator Lundy smiling and shaking her head. Under the system which the Labor Party introduced, wholesale sales tax ranged from 12 per cent to 22 per cent and to 32 per cent on many of the items which we know Senator Lundy has a particular interest in, like computers and matters to do with information technology.</para></talk.start><para>There was a huge need to reform our taxation system and this government was brave enough to go to the Australian people on a policy of reforming the tax system. We went to an election and we won that election. The underlying concept was to go from a direct tax system to an indirect system. As the direct taxation base was diminishing year by year, the need to move to an indirect tax system became increasingly apparent. As has been said earlier in this debate, in previous years the Labor Party supported the need to go to an indirect system because it knew that that was something Australia had to do, along with almost every other country in the OECD. But for purely political reasons in the last election, the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Kim Beazley, countermanded the original support given to the proposal to introduce a GST by Gareth Evans. Instead, the Labor Party, for purely political reasons, decided to oppose this tax system. It generated a great program of scaremongering and put fear into the hearts of many of the Australian people, trying to confuse them about what was really a very simple proposal.</para><para>The simple proposal was that, in return for abolishing the absolute mishmash and mess of Labor's wholesale sales tax system, we would have a 10 per cent tax on goods and services. It was very simple and straightforward—a 10 per cent tax across the board. As a trade-off for the income so generated, the states would get a dedicated tax stream from that tax to provide hospitals, schools, roads, better police services and all the things that states provide, and the Australian people across the board would get substantial tax cuts. Of course, that is what is in the package. Under our proposal, 80 per cent of the Australian people will only be paying a maximum of 30 cents in the dollar in taxation. They are going to have substantially more disposable income.</para><para>The cost of most things will come down quite dramatically not only because Labor's wholesale sales taxes will come off but also because, as a result of that, the cost of running businesses will be reduced. That is why there has been a lot of discussion on whether or not the price of books will rise. As has been said, the price should not rise. If the 
 price does rise and it rises unreasonably, there is a system in place, through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, under which people all over Australia can complain. People can complain to the ACCC about unreasonable price rises. The ACCC has enormous power to ensure that cost cuts are passed on. The ACCC is able to impose fines of up to $10 million on businesses which do not pass on cost cuts, and the government has provided the ACCC with substantial extra funding of $28 million over three years for its role under the bill. The protection of the consumer will thus be embodied in the additional powers given to the ACCC. So the end result of all of this is that, within a few days, we will have a new tax system in Australia which will benefit most people and prices should not rise.<inline font-style="italic"> (Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

</para><para>Your petitioners ask/request that the Senate should not pass the legislation until the following questions are resolved fairly and equitable for the citizens of Tasmania:</para><para>1.	 How will the government ensure Tasmania is treated fairly in comparison to the more affluent and larger States? Tasmania, on a per capita basis, has the highest unemployment, lowest average weekly wage, the oldest population, the greatest number of people dependent on government income support and the most decentralised population of any state of Australia. The government's model for estimating the cost of the GST does not allow for the different economic and social patterns between states.</para><para>2.	 How will the government ensure families can afford good food which will be relatively more expensive in respect to `junk' foods whose price will decrease after the removal of sales tax? Tasmanians pay the highest costs for food in Australia and are among the worst health status population in Australia.</para><para>3.	 How will the government ensure that organisations and charities can continue to provide the necessary community services and support to disadvantaged citizens? Community organisations and charities in Tasmania will face a double jeopardy from the implementation of the Tax Package. It is predicted that poverty in Tasmania will increase and more people will be seeking extra assistance. At the same time organisations will have a reduced capacity to meet those needs because of increased administrative costs associated with compliance and in many instances reduced revenue because of the application of the tax to such things as membership fees and fund raising.</para><para>4.	 How will government ensure that service quality and scope of education, child care and health services can be maintained without increasing the costs of these services? The government proposes that essential services such as education, child care and health will be GST free. However, community based organisations offering these services will have increased costs arising from the extra administration and accounting requirements of the tax package.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name><name.id>N26</name.id></talker><para>Senator Abetz(from 84 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Goods and Services Tax</title><page.no>5725</page.no><no.signed>116</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>HX5</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Woodley</name><name> Sen John</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</para><para>We, the undersigned petitioners believe that</para><para>(a)	 a valid mandate does not exist for the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST)

However over the past few years, a number of military inquiries, and disciplinary matters conducted by the Australian Defence Force, have become the subject of considerable public interest and media comment. Predominantly these cases involved the loss of lives of Service personnel or seeming injustices to members of the Australian Defence Force in their dealings with the military disciplinary system.</para><para>The considerable public attention focused on such cases has included criticisms of the efficacy of the current military inquiry system and questions of natural justice and human rights. Additionally, there has been considerable public support behind calls for external inquiries, or at the very least external reviews of inquiries, in cases involving the death of an Australian Defence Force member. Less public attention has been focused on the systems of discipline and administrative action employed by the Australian Defence Force although aspects of the Defence Force Discipline Act have been challenged, on several occasions, in the High Court of Australia in recent years.</para><para>The Senate, in referring this inquiry to the Committee on 25 November 1997, and re-referring it on 10 March 1999, asked the Committee to examine the existing legislative framework and procedures for the conduct of military inquiries and Australian Defence Force disciplinary processes. During the course of the inquiry, the Committee identified a third, interrelated component of the military justice system: administrative action. The report addresses these three distinct components of the military justice system employed within the Australian Defence Force: military inquiries, military discipline and administrative action.</para><para>Each of these components is expansive and the Committee has not attempted an exhaustive examination of every detail of the military justice system. Rather the Committee has sought to examine the existing legislation, policies and framework of the system of military justice employed by the Australian Defence Force and to evaluate their effectiveness and relevance in practice.</para><para>Independence and impartiality in the military justice system was a strong theme throughout the conduct of the inquiry. In cases involving the death 
 of an Australian Defence Force member, the Committee was aware of a strong feeling, particularly from some family members of the deceased, that the military justice system lacks independence. While the Committee received no evidence to support an allegation of a lack of independence in the military justice system there is no question that this perception exists in some quarters.</para><para>The Committee was cognisant that while the military justice system must, so far as possible, conform with community norms, the Australian Defence Force has unique requirements for the administration of justice commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation. Moreover, these unique requirements exist as constraints and standards additional to the justice system that pertains to all citizens of Australia. Notwithstanding that members of the Australian Defence Force voluntarily accept the imposition of an additional layer of justice when they choose to serve their country, the military justice system must be demonstrably independent, impartial and fair.</para><para>The Committee acknowledged the considerable changes, made by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system during the course of the inquiry. Indeed the Committee inquiry was conducted in a somewhat dynamic environment with the Australian Defence Force moving to address the recommendations of Brigadier the Honourable A R Abadee's 1997 report, <inline font-style="italic">A Study into Judicial System under the Defence Force Discipline Act</inline>  and the Ombudsman's 1998 <inline font-style="italic">Investigation into how the Australian Defence Force responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences</inline> .</para><para>Given these circumstances of significant change in the military justice system, it is a persuasive argument that time should be allowed for the benefits of these changes to be realised before further change is contemplated. However the Committee was of the view that Australian Defence Force initiated changes to procedures and practices will not fully address both the <inline font-style="italic">perceived</inline>  and <inline font-style="italic">actual</inline>  independence and impartiality of the military justice system.</para><para>The principal question confronting the Committee was how to redress this shortfall in the military justice system without impeding the workings of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed foremost in the Committee's considerations was the need for any system of military justice to function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the Australian Defence Force can be expected to operate.</para><para>Madam President, the report tabled today contains 59 recommendations. Forty five of these recommendations relate to the military inquiry system, seven to the system of military discipline and a further seven recommendations relate to the administrative action process employed by the Australian 
 Defence Force. The most consequential of these recommendations relate to the conduct of military inquiries.</para><para>The Committee was of the view that the issues of independence and impartiality would not be fully addressed by the changes proposed, by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system. To redress this the Committee has proposed a number of significant changes.</para><para>Perhaps the most important of these proposals is for a latent power within Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the prerogative of the Minister of Defence to convene a General Court of Inquiry, to be mandatory for all inquiries into matters involving the accidental death of an Australian Defence Force member. This will serve to remove the Department of Defence from the investigative process thus negating any conflict of interest and ensuring independence in the inquiry. The Committee accepted that the conduct of an inquiry by an authority external to the Australian Defence Force will involve some costs in time, resources and perhaps capability. However, the Committee was of the view that the need to demonstrate the independence of the inquiry outweighs concerns about the conduct of the inquiry by an external authority.</para><para>The Committee considered the option of proposing that a General Court of Inquiry be convened by the Minister in all cases involving major capital loss. However, the Committee acknowledged the difficulties in determining what is major capital loss and perhaps more significantly the problems with the operation of such arrangements during conflict. The Committee accepted that in most cases a Board of Inquiry would provide a suitable avenue to investigate major capital loss and that the Minister currently has, under Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the discretion to convene a General Court of Inquiry where an issue was of such gravity to warrant independence greater than that offered by a Board of Inquiry.</para><para>To demonstrate the independence and impartiality of the system of military inquiries, the Committee was of the view that Department of Defence should publicly account for its decisions in discharging the recommendations of General Courts of Inquiry and Boards of Inquiry. In addition, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Defence Force should publicly account for the operation of the military justice system by the provision of an annual report to the Minister of Defence. Furthermore, that the annual report be tabled in the Parliament by the Minister.</para><para>With regard to General Courts of Inquiry, the Committee has recommended that following the conduct of a General Court of Inquiry, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and adminis 
 trative action, the Minister of Defence should table in the Parliament:</para><para>a) the inquiry report;</para><para>b) the recommendations of the investigating body;</para><para>c) details of action taken to adopt those recommendations; and</para><para>d) where a recommendation is rejected, the reasons for that action.</para><para>The Committee did not believe that the public accountability requirements for Boards of Inquiry should be any less than those for General Courts of Inquiry. To this end, the Committee has recommended that, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and administrative action, the Australian Defence Force publicly account for its actions and decisions in discharging the recommendations of the Board.</para><para>The Committee accepted that the post-Abadee arrangements will significantly improve the impartiality and independence of the military discipline system. While the alternative of an independent prosecution authority was examined in detail, the Committee concluded that the option for the creation of such a body should be re-examined after the impact of the post-Abadee arrangements could be effectively assessed. For this reason, the Committee recommended that, after the proposed post-Abadee arrangements have been in operation for three years, the issue of institutional independence in relation to prosecution in Courts Martial and Defence Force Magistrate trials be reviewed.</para><para>The Committee has also proposed some changes to the administrative action process employed within the Australian Defence Force. Perhaps of most significance, the Committee recommended that the Australian Defence Force consider the implementation of a revised framework administrative censure and formal warning that makes the process applicable to all members of the Australian Defence Force and that incorporates a separation between the roles of initiating officer and decision-maker.</para><para>The Committee identified that one of the major sources of dissatisfaction with the military inquiry process were next of kin, or close family members of personnel killed while engaged in ADF activities. It was impossible to hear the evidence given by family members who had lost a loved one in such circumstances without gaining a very strong view that the system of military justice needs a degree of fine tuning to allow the next of kin greater access to the inquiry process.</para><para>Without doubt these is a strong perception amongst many family members that the present military justice inquiry process lacked independence. We were not provided with any evidence to support this 
 claim. But the fact that the perception persists indicates that some part or parts of the inquiry process are inadequate in terms of demonstrating to family members that: the process is transparent; all necessary steps have been undertaken; and where necessary, accountability measures are instituted.</para><para>The Committee acknowledged the need for these families who have lost a husband or wife parent or child to have some closure for their own grief. While the changes recommended in this report will help relatives in the future it will not have a retrospective effect. But families who have already lost a lost one during service in the ADF can take some comfort from having brought about the changes recommended in this report.</para><para>Those changes recommended by the Committee include:</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">Attendance at Inquiry. </inline> The next of kin, or other immediate relatives, of an ADF member whose death is the subject of an inquiry, should always be permitted to attend that inquiry regardless of whether the inquiry is conducted in private or is open to the public. Exclusion of these next of kin, or other immediate relatives from the inquiry should only be on a temporary basis, from those sections of the inquiry dealing with matters of national security.</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">Informed of Outcomes. </inline> Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should, within the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Privacy Act</inline>  and relevant security considerations, be provided with a copy of the inquiry report and advice on all actions taken as a result of the inquiry. Where a recommendation from the inquiry report is not implemented, next of kin should be provided with the reasons underpinning the decision not to adopt that recommendation.</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">Advised Prior to Press Release.</inline>  Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should be warned prior to the release of information to the press regarding the inquiry.</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">Legal Representation.</inline>  Where a deceased member of the ADF is likely to be affected by an inquiry, the next of kin or other immediate relative should be afforded the option to have the interests of the deceased member represented, at Commonwealth expense, by Service legal counsel.</para><para>.	<inline font-weight="bold">Counselling Services. </inline> The ADF should establish processes to ensure that counselling services are available to witnesses to a military inquiry and to next of kin and close relatives of ADF members killed in the incident.</para><para>While the Committee is of the view that the recommendations of this report will serve to 
 improve the independence, impartiality and overall operation of the system, it is acknowledged that the report will be disappointing for some who saw the inquiry as an avenue of review for individual cases. It should be emphasised that this function was not within the Terms of Reference for the inquiry, nor was it within the powers of the Committee. Where the Committee touched on individual cases it did so solely to examine the procedures employed and the effectiveness of the military justice system.</para><para>The inquiry created a lot of public interest, and I would like to thank all of the people who took the time to write submissions, to appear at the public hearings or simply made contact with the secretariat. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Defence Sub-Committee in this Parliament and also in the 38th Parliament.</para><para>Finally on behalf of all Committee members I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the excellent Secretariat staff so ably led by Joanne Towner and Margaret Swieringa and our military advisers Paul Hislop and Michael Ward.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>5731</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force is very important—all reports from the committee are very important. I have been a member of the committee for most of my time in this parliament and I have been a member of the defence subcommittee, which prepared this report on behalf of the joint committee, for most of that time. This may not be a report which the large bulk of the Australian population would find interesting reading or would queue at the government bookshop to purchase, but the issues which it has dealt with are very important for the morale and the operation of the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen consistent controversy over a period of time about the way the Defence Force handles issues where people are stood down while they are charged under various offences. This is an issue where philosophically you have a conflict between the need for a defence force to provide discipline and arrangements to maintain the good organisation of a military unit, and the right of the individual to make sure that, in a civilised and democratic society, even though they are 
 members of the Defence Force, they receive due process and fairness in military tribunals if they have been charged with any number of matters under the military code of Australia. That code is part of an extensive document which has been built up not just over recent years but over decades, beginning with what we inherited from Great Britain.</para><para>I want to pay particular tribute to the members of the committee; to David MacGibbon, the chair of the committee, whose interest in defence matters is well known in this place and elsewhere; and also to the Deputy Chair, my colleague Roger Price. This report—as I say, it will not be a best seller—will be very important in outlining arrangements for the military in coming years. At this stage, people in the broader community and particularly in the military community will be able to respond. I think there will be proper debate. Those of us on the defence subcommittee look forward to debate on the recommendations. I do not believe that any of the recommendations in themselves are unduly controversial, though they total nearly 60, nor would they be hard for the Department of Defence to digest and put into practice. Of course, they will respond and we will wait for the government's response on behalf of the Department of Defence in the next three months.</para><para>I want to say to the government that I hope that they do respond in a thorough manner to these recommendations within the three months required and not just put this off as too difficult or not as pressing as maybe some other issues. When we get the response of the government, the Senate and House of Representatives can have a further debate about these recommendations.</para><para>I am not going to go through these recommendations one by one—I do not have the time—and I am not going to try to just speak to one or two. In my view these recommendations update and make more contemporary the processes of handling justice in the military. They are, as I say, not radical: we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Members of the Defence Force can, I think, get a better process and, if they are charged and dealt with, they can believe that they have 
 every right to get full justice and an independent hearing.</para><para>It is clear that what we accepted as reasonable in the past in the operation of the military will not be able to be sustained totally in the first decade of the next century and into the future. If we want to attract the best quality young people in our community with tertiary qualifications—and we are going to need them in view of the highly complex and technical equipment now available in the Defence Force—we have to show that they will be treated in the Defence Force in a manner that the rest of the community thinks is reasonable. And that will mean some adjustment. If we do not make these adjustments and improvements in process, on such issues as military justice and the procedures thereof, I think we will run the risk of not being able to attract the best and the brightest into our defence forces. There would be a deficiency in our national security if we could not attract the best into the system.</para><para>Certainly I, like other members of the committee who have had dealings with Defence and opportunities to visit Defence establishments, have met both formally and informally with the staff and service people of Defence. All of us have been impressed by their quality, particularly the young people coming through the Australian Defence Force Academy and the various service colleges. We have been impressed by their quality and want that quality to be not only maintained but consistently improved in line with improvements in the community.</para><para>As I have said, this is an important document. I think it proves that the standing committees of the parliament can be extremely useful in putting forward recommendations in areas of sensitivity and making recommendations that governments in a measured way can respond to. You should note that in these recommendations, as far as I can see, there is no dissenting report. Clearly, the opposition members have accepted the government's majority view and so, as far as I am aware, there is no dissenting report. I think that is an excellent outcome. I think the minor parties were represented on the committee, as well as— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—No, I got kicked off, remember.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Senator Margetts, the full committee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee is represented by Labor, Liberal, Democrats and Independents.

This is, I think, a good example of the work of the standing committees of the parliament dealing with sensitive issues. A bi-partisan approach can be reached to the advantage of the Defence Force. I commend the report to the parliament, the government and the defence forces.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5732</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate today, but I think it is very important for us to understand that processes of justice not only have to be seen but have to be seen to be done fairly and properly. There are many examples in this country, over many years, where the judicial processes which we take for granted in civilian life have not been extended to the military. Mind you, I think one or two of the provisions that apply to the military—and, in fact, recommendations have been made in the report to strengthen them—could be something that the rest of the community needs to deal with as well. Great improvement could be made to many of the issues concerning the justice system in this country which come under scrutiny.</para></talk.start><para>I want to have a look at a couple of the recommendations in the report, namely recommendations 18 to 21, and draw them to the attention of the Senate. One would hope that, with a report as all encompassing as this one—namely, a 60-recommendation report of this type—the military and the minister and his office would take a close look at the recommendations and that in fact we will see 
 considerable progress made on these by the time we get to estimates next year or possibly the year after.</para><para>Recommendations 18 through to 21 deal primarily with the processes by which a person is notified if there is a complaint against them and the procedures by which those complaints are dealt with. What it really does is set down some basic principles of natural justice which will apply to soldiers, sailors and airmen—and I use those terms for both male and female these days, because there are large numbers of females in all three arms of our services—so that, if a complaint is made against them, they are properly informed of that allegation and they are told what procedures will follow from that complaint. The principles also mean that, if a report is made which is critical of an ADF member, that person is accorded the proper procedures for answering that complaint and that, ultimately, when it comes to legal recourse within the military, the investigating body thoroughly and properly advises the parties concerned of the course of action that is going to take place and of the entire nature of the allegation against the person.</para><para>The report is a full one. Indeed, I think it deals with many aspects of justice within the military which have not been dealt with before. I am only a new member to the committee so I cannot give any historic perspective on that, in the way that, say, my colleague Senator MacGibbon no doubt will in his address here today. From my knowledge, it is the first time that the committee has made recommendations on these points and has dealt with them at all in any manner.</para><para>Without saying too much more I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a few other recommendations in the report and then let some of my other colleagues make a couple of comments on it. I think it is rather interesting that recommendations 25 through to 28, respectively, deal with the military's approach with regard to the next of kin of a person who unfortunately has been killed in a military incident. I think it is rather a shame in many respects that it has taken a report of this nature to deal with what is, it must be said, a very difficult but necessary issue. It has been 
 some years since we have had any combat related deaths in the Australian ADF but, as I understand it, each year there are persons who are killed by way of training or other incidents in the Australian Defence Force. Some of these instances lead to charges of negligence against the person concerned and in fact against the person who has been killed or against that person and others.</para><para>So I think that these recommendations are commonsense and important and that they really need to be taken up. I suspect that senators from all sides will be keen to ask the Defence personnel when they come before us for estimates about what progress is being made on these recommendations. We look with interest to see how the Defence establishment accepts this report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5733</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Being a member of the Senate legislation committee which deals with defence matters at estimates, I find that the issues in this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are of real concern. I have addressed them in past estimates without the availability of a comprehensive report such as the joint standing committee have put together. On that basis, I firstly put on the record my congratulations to the joint committee for undertaking this vast report and for making it available for someone like me at Senate estimates.</para></talk.start><para>I noticed in the brief time in which I have been able to look at the report that it does get to the fundamentals of basic justice within the military. Of course, that should apply whether it is military or whether it is in the civilian world. In particular, I noted the comments in respect of mischievous allegations and the fact that there was evidence presented to the committee that false accusations are presented in some military tribunals. The report says:</para><para>. . . false or misleading accusations were used to the detriment of individuals, even where the resultant investigations failed to prove any offence committed by the individual.</para><para>One can see that the military do close ranks in the strictest sense of the terms but, of course, no-one has the right to destroy anyone's career by way of misleading allegations or accusations. One would hope that, as 
 a result of this report, every effort is undertaken to ensure that this practice is eliminated and the careers of some very promising people within the military are not destroyed.</para><para>This is a timely report in another sense. The defence forces are undergoing a period of upheaval under the Defence Reform Program, and that sets a lot of things in train which would see people jealous of what others have achieved under the Defence Reform Program by way of promotion or changes in their status whilst others may be standing still marking time. So we need to ensure that the processes that are in place will protect the integrity of those people who have rightfully achieved and to ensure that those people are not subject to any false or wrongful accusation as a result of a process that is turning the Defence Force on its head at the present moment.</para><para>The only other issue that I want to comment on is one that I have always been concerned about, and that is the training of Defence Force personnel. The report at paragraph 3.151 specifically refers to the need for there to be a degree of competence of ADF officers, such that:</para><para>. . . the effective and efficient conduct of military inquiries calls for considerable knowledge and judgement of those involved. The ADF acknowledged that relatively few officers are called upon to either personally inquire into a matter as an Investigating Officer or to participate as a member of a BOI and there is a lack of experience.</para><para>The report goes on to further recognise that there is a need to have these people trained to a degree and level of competence which will enable them to participate in the processes that are necessary within the defence forces.</para><para>I believe that the report is a breakthrough. It will be something that will be subject to greater scrutiny at the estimates process—because, at the end of the day, one must be assured that justice is not just being seen to be done but is being done within our defence forces. Where on some occasions defence inquiries can be suppressed, hushed up to protect the interests of a few, that should not be allowed. The processes outlined in this report will undoubtedly guarantee integrity for all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>5734</page.no><name role="metadata">MacGibbon, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator MacGIBBON</name><name.id>YH4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank Senators Schacht, Quirke and Hogg for their enthusiastic and genuine support for this inquiry, which, as Senator Schacht said, produced a unanimous report from all the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and not only of the defence subcommittee. Towards the end of 1997, Senator Schacht moved in this chamber that the subject of military justice be referred to the joint committee and now, some years later, this report is tabled before us.</para></talk.start><para>As a longstanding member of that committee, I can say that I have never been involved in any inquiry as complex as this one. It is a very detailed and technical subject to inquire into, and what is tabled today in the Senate is no light reading before you go to sleep at night. But I believe that it is a very constructive report and that it will be very beneficial to the morale and conduct of operations of the ADF in the years ahead. I believe that the ADF will have no difficulty in accepting all the recommendations that we have made.</para><para>At the outset, the committee recognised the need for military justice. Most of the justice that is administered within the Australian Defence Force is administered under civilian law and has been so for many years. Major crimes like rape, murder, theft and things of that nature are always referred to the civilian courts and, wherever possible, if there is a way of referring a matter to the civilian courts the defence department does so. But we do need military justice because we require the defence forces to do perverse actions—actions that have no parallel at all in civilian life.</para><para>At the end of the day, the members of the Australian Defence Force are different from all of us in this chamber, because they literally die on orders, and no-one in this room does that. We require them to perform acts of extreme violence but to do so in a very disciplined way, and so the existence of a highly disciplined code of behaviour is essential to a defence force. If you do not have that, then you have such tragedies as befell the Canadian army on its deployment to Somalia, where it became involved in torture, murder and theft. Discipline is absolutely 
 essential. If a force is not disciplined, it is a threat to a democratic society and to the members of its own ranks.</para><para>The need for a military justice system to see that discipline is fairly, impartially and independently exercised is absolutely paramount. In the Australian Defence Force, that justice system is mediated through three broad streams: the Defence Force Discipline Act, the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, and administrative action.</para><para>The Defence Force Discipline Act was brought down in 1985 and replaced a hotchpotch of old British military legislation, some of which had in fact been abandoned by the United Kingdom defence forces many years previously. The Defence Force Discipline Act of 1985 was an Australian approach to the legislative requirement for discipline within the Defence Force and it covers, as its name says, matters of discipline, trials of members of the ADF and all the things in the way of penalties from that.</para><para>The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, which came in at about the same time in 1985, really are there to find out why accidents happen. Military training is always dangerous and, sadly, there will always be a mortality rate, because it must get as close to reality as possible. Everything must be done by the Australian Defence Force to make sure that people are not killed or injured on exercises but, with the best of planning, some accidents will occur. What we cannot tolerate is any negligence or incompetence in those administering training exercises which result in the loss of lives or injury or major property loss.</para><para>The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations are set up to find out why accidents happen and, therefore, the speed and accuracy of the inquiry are paramount. Because of that, the usual requirements of courts of law with respect to evidence and the fact that you can refuse to answer a question on the grounds that you might incriminate yourself do not apply. In the converse of that, the pay-off is that, if someone answers and incriminates themselves, it cannot be used against them in a subsequent court action as a disciplinary measure. The whole purpose of defence inquiries is to find out why accidents happen 
 so that they can be prevented from happening again and, in some cases, the time span can be quite short.</para><para>The defence inquiries operate through a level of inquiries, starting with the board of inquiry, through investigating officers and down to quite minor events. One of the characteristics that is not appreciated by the civilian community is that it has never been a requirement for the inquiry process to blame someone for the accident. The inquiry process has the power to recommend that, if a prima facie case exists for the Defence Force Discipline Act to be applied against someone, that finding can be made if it is in the terms of reference setting up the board of inquiry. In recent years on major boards of inquiry that requirement has not been stipulated and, because of that, there has been a perception in the community that there is a lack of accountability in the ADF.</para><para>The final stream, the administrative action pathway, deals with professional and personal development, and it is of lesser importance than the two other streams that I have talked about. Overall, the committee found that the system was very sound—98 per cent of it is working very well and there are no problems. In its 60-odd recommendations, the committee recommended finetuning of the process. Where possible, it has introduced modern practices, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers.</para><para>The overriding impression the committee got from hearing witnesses was that there was a perception of a lack of independence from some of the relatives of deceased service personnel and, flowing from that, a lack of accountability. That is very important in a volunteer service because it affects morale and a whole range of other matters. I have to emphasise that the committee found no evidence at all that there was a lack of independence in the process but, as figures in public life, we all recognise that perceptions are very important. We decided that the perception of a lack of independence was a very major shortcoming of the present system, and we set out to find a means to overcome it. That took us a great deal of time.</para><para>We came up with the proposition that a latent power in the defence inquiry regulations—namely the ability of the minister to refer an inquiry to a general court of inquiry—be used. This has never been used since the regulations were brought into force in 1985. Referring a matter to a general court of inquiry takes it entirely out of the Department of Defence's control and refers it to either a Supreme Court judge from the states or a Federal Court judge. The process that flows from there is entirely independent of the Department of Defence. We believe that that not only will create the perception of independence in major inquiries but will also create the reality of independence. So one of our significant recommendations was that, where death occurs as a consequence of an ADF activity, the minister must refer the matter to a general court of inquiry.</para><para>I am confident that the defence department will accept all the recommendations we have made. They are all constructive; they all operate within existing systems. There is nothing new in what we propose that is radical or will turn anything on its head. There are minimal costs involved, if any costs at all. Most importantly, the preservation of the command authority of officers in the ADF is preserved. We think we have come up with a very pragmatic approach and we are confident that the defence department, having shown a great readiness to implement the recommendations of Mr Justice Abadee in relation to the Defence Force Discipline Act within the last 12 months, will carry on with the good work and implement our findings, which I believe will be for the benefit of all.</para><para>Finally, I would like to thank very much my deputy chairman, the Hon. Roger Price, for the support he gave me on the defence subcommittee, and the other members of the committee, some of whom have spoken today. I also thank the staff: the secretary, Joanne Towner, now replaced by Margaret Swieringa, and particularly Michael Ward and Paul Hislop, who were the military advisers to the committee.

All of the Auditor-General reports were presented in a lump. I was listening, but I was listening for the <inline font-style="italic">Energy Efficiency in Commonwealth Operations—Department of Industry, Science and Resources: Australian Greenhouse Office</inline>  report, and apparently it was all-in-one, so I wondered if we might return to that.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate. I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>For a long time, an ongoing interest of mine has been the possibilities of greenhouse gas reductions in the government's own operations and the economic benefits that can be gained.</para><para>The report relates to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources' Australian Greenhouse Office. Some issues have been brought up in the performance audit leaflet. There were 12 energy policy requirements. They have been met to varying degrees, and I will talk about some of those in more detail. They did mention that there were significant practical and administrative issues that required resolution before there would be an appropriate level of compliance, and that many systems and procedures of those agencies remain to be developed by both coordinating and other agencies. That is quite serious. Australia unfortunately presented to the world that it could not possibly reduce greenhouse levels any further than we had finally acceded to in Kyoto at the Climate Change Conference and yet, even within the government sector, there seems to be a level of inactivity in relation to its own targets. I will give you some examples of these in relation to the summary of the National Audit Office findings. One is in relation to CEO accountability. The finding says:</para><para>There has been a variable standard in the implementation in areas such as adequate policy interpre 
 tation, interagency promulgation, skill and knowledge acquisition and energy policy achievements.</para><para>It is at the CEO level where these kinds of policies ought to be implemented. It is not the kind of thing you can just throw off to an environment officer within your department and expect that you are going to get changes within those areas.</para><para>Another comes under conduct of energy audits. This is very important. An energy audit is the way in which a body, an organisation and even a business can actually find out where the possible savings exist and what changes they need to make. The finding here was quite concerning. It said:</para><para>The current level of energy audit activity is not significant. There is a high risk that the energy auditing requirement of the energy policy will not be complied with unless adequate systems and procedures are developed by both coordinating and other agencies.</para><para>If government bodies do not know and are not prepared to look, they are obviously not going to be making the changes.</para><para>Let us look at the use of renewable energy technologies. The findings here are also concerning. The summary of the policy statement is that all agencies are to use solar and other renewable energy technologies where relevant and cost effective. At the time of the audit the findings were that DISR had not advised agencies of this component of the energy policy requirements in material distributed to Commonwealth agencies. This is the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and they had not actually advised agencies that they were required to use solar and other renewable energy technologies where relevant and cost effective. Something is wrong here. There is a slip between cup and mouth and it actually goes to the credibility of the government when they say they are unable to do better in relation to these policies. Of course, the Audit Office was not able to examine where there was compliance if there had not actually been a request for these activities to take place.</para><para>Once again, let us look at the adherence to Commonwealth building energy use guidelines. We heard of these issues in relation to things like legislation in relation to Common 
 wealth housing and, if I recall, defence housing came up with some great policies. What we need to find out here is whether, in general, these policies are being adhered to. The finding is that, in general, compliance with this requirement is low and there are significant practical problems confronting agencies attempting to comply with this mandatory requirement. So basically, when it comes to purchasing buildings, somehow or other the light is not going on, or perhaps the energy efficient light bulb is not going on, in the minds of those people whose role is to be involved in the purchase of such buildings.</para><para>Under section 6 we look at negotiation of particular central services, energy payment arrangements and leases. I am not entirely sure where this fits into it—it seems like it is something entirely different. Basically, they are asking that the building owners are responsible for the energy requirements—that is, the central energy use payments—as part of the lease. That, I assume, would mean that the cost savings would be passed on to the building owners the more energy efficient the building became. I am not quite sure why this is quite like this, but it obviously indicates there is an incentive, or should be an incentive, for the saleability of leases and that building owners should take an active role in reducing the ongoing energy requirements for the central energy services that are required.</para><para>Those are brickbats, I suppose. For bouquets, I guess when you turn to page 95 you will see that in Parliament House the total energy consumption reduced quite considerably in 1988-89, and from then on there has been some decrease. I assume that probably meant that there was a considerable energy wastage in relation to 1988-89 and that it might have been involved with the movement to a new building and so on. But in terms of gas use we are looking at around half the gas use between 1988-89 and 1997-98. Electricity use was not quite as impressive but one-third of that electricity use was cut. That is important when you look at the fact that electricity contributes a great deal more than gas to greenhouse gas production. So it is possible that these changes can take place.</para><para>On page 97 we see that from the years 1993-94 the Australian Taxation Office made some efforts but were more successful in some states than others. Somehow or other Victoria did not do as well as it might, but states like New South Wales did quite well in relation to reducing energy consumption within the Australian Taxation Office. The ACT was basically using more than it did in 1993-94 but less than it did in 1996-97, so I hope that there are ongoing policies in relation to this. Western Australia seems to be lumped into South Australia and has made some changes in that time.</para><para>That is about as central as we can get, I guess. If governments decide there is the potential for taking steps—if you call this the `no regrets policy'—those changes that you can make that actually save you money do not have a net cost because they cut down your energy costs. We are not actually doing as well as we can, even within the government bodies in no regrets policies. We need to do much, much better and the rest of the world, to give us any credibility, has got to see that even at the government level we are taking the issue of global warming, climate change and greenhouse gas production seriously. This does not unfortunately indicate that the government is yet taking it seriously enough, and that the Department of Industry, Science and Resources may have other issues in mind rather than greenhouse gas reductions.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>5738</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Migration Committee</title><page.no>5738</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>5738</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5738</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled `Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B', together with submissions, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record and minutes of proceedings.

</para><para>I wish to put on the record the committee's acknowledgment of the very fine work done by the secretariat staff of the committee. They were, for the record, Margaret Swieringa, Gim Del Villar, Penne Humphries, Rohan Tyler and Margaret Atkin.</para><para>The regulation 4.31B was introduced on 1 July 1997 as part of a package of measures to combat abuse in Australia's refugee determination system. Other measures included streamlining processing of primary applications and limiting work rights to applicants who applied within 45 days of entering Australia.</para><para>The aim of the package was to deter people who knew they were not refugees but were using the refugee appeal process to prolong their stay here, often for the purposes of obtaining income from employment in Australia. The purpose of regulation 4.31B was, in conjunction with other measures, to deter non-genuine applicants from appealing to the Refugee Review Tribunal after their primary application had been unsuccessful. The regulation imposed a $1,000 fee on applicants whose appeals to the RRT failed. Successful applicants to the RRT were not required to pay the fee of $1,000 and neither were unsuccessful applicants to the RRT who were subsequently granted protection visas on the basis of ministerial discretion. It was not suggested then that regulation 4.31B was a revenue raising measure, nor was it suggested at the time that the revenue raised by the fee was to be used to offset departmental costs in other areas of the portfolio.</para><para>The regulation was controversial, and the then shadow minister for immigration, Duncan Kerr, agreed to the package on condition that a number of its provisions be changed. Those changes are already on the public record. One of the conditions imposed which the government agreed to was that the regulation be subject to a sunset clause and that a review of its operations and effect be conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This report is the result of that review.</para><para>I participated in all of the committee's public hearings, and I have read and studied all of the submissions. From this process I 
 have formed my own conclusions on the regulation. My conclusions differ from those of my Labor colleagues on the committee, and I have provided a direct, succinct additional comment at page 45 of the report which elucidates further on the reasons I formed the views that I did. In formulating my conclusions I relied upon the evidence that was presented to the committee—evidence which, I might add, was tested with the witnesses who provided the evidence to the committee. The evidence was tested, sometimes quite vigorously, and cannot therefore be dismissed.</para><para>Many of the witnesses—who came with impeccable credentials—agreed that, even now, with the conditions that were put in place two years ago, the internal onshore refugee application system continues to be abused. I have noted in my additional comments some comments from the Refugee Council of Australia—the peak refugee organisation in this country. I have also itemised comments on the matter made by the Secretary-General of the Australian Section of the International Commission for Jurists, Mr David Bitel, and I have drawn attention to the comments of Ms Grace Gardner from the Adelaide Justice Coalition and a number of others.</para><para>I particularly want to draw attention to the words of Ms Caroline Graydon from the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre. I will quote what she said. I know it is a duplication, but it is well worth duplicating. Ms Graydon told the committee at the Melbourne hearings:</para><para>From my own personal knowledge, I am not aware of any cases where I thought a person had very strong prospects of success but had been deterred by applying due to the $1000 penalty fee. Some people are driven by such strong subjective fear that I do consider it to be unlikely that someone who faces persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, in their home country would be deterred.</para><para>On every possible opportunity I asked the witnesses to provide evidence of people who had been deterred from making an application because of this post-decision fee. Nobody was forthcoming. I put it to the Senate—as I put it to the committee when we were deliberating on the report—that, if anybody would know 
 about a deterrent, people such as Caroline Graydon, the Refugee Council of Australia and Mr David Bitel certainly would have known, and I am sure they would have put it on the public record when they had the opportunity to do so at the committee hearings.</para><para>We were given some case studies of people who allegedly were suffering because of the fee, and I have noted those case studies in my 3½ pages of additional comment. They are on the public record for anybody to examine. In a sense, I think those case studies actually help the argument for the minister's case that the fee should be retained.</para><para>Notwithstanding what I have said, I agree with the majority of the committee and their report that it is probably too early to judge the effectiveness of the measure. Effectively, the measure has been in existence for only 18 months. I know it is now almost a two-year period, but at the time we were examining it and taking evidence it had been in operation for about 18 months to 21 months. Many witnesses to the hearings agreed that it was a very short time frame and that many of the applications that had been before the RRT and were being adjudicated on actually had been in the system prior to the fee coming into operation.</para><para>I have agreed with my colleagues that the sunset clause should be extended for a further three years and that, prior to the expiration of that sunset clause, it should be subjected to a more thorough assessment of its effectiveness. Let me at this stage inject a note of caution and a warning. I mentioned earlier that regulation 4.31B was not a revenue raising measure, nor was it an offsetting cost initiative. I now await specific clarification from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this matter. This clarification is necessary as a result of a sentence in his press statement MPS/99 dated 11 May 1999 where he said:</para><para>If the fee was continued it would provide a partial cost recovery and help offset the cost of a limited extension of the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.</para><para>I have been advised through the office of the shadow minister, Mr Con Sciacca, that a letter 
 will be forthcoming from the minister that gives the assurance that there is absolutely no policy link between the fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.</para><para>I hope that that letter will be forthcoming and I hope the clarification will be forthcoming. If it is not, I state clearly here that I will be arguing in my party room that we support any disallowance motion, if such a disallowance motion is moved, in the event of the minister seeking to continue the fee. There should be no link between this fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme. There never has been and, if there is going to be that linkage now, I for one will not be standing here in this chamber or in my party room supporting such a proposition. It was never the case in the past and it should not be the case now. I certainly await the minister's written reply. I have been assured that that is forthcoming. It would have been easier had we been able to be given that assurance during the Senate estimates committee processes a couple of weeks ago, but I do understand that the public servants could not publicly stand up and contradict their minister. The ball on this matter is clearly in the minister's court, and I have put on the record how I will be arguing if that letter and that assurance are not forthcoming. I commend the report to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5740</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to speak to this report as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It was quite a useful and thorough inquiry, as many of the inquiries conducted by that committee are. It highlighted again not just issues relating specifically to the $1,000 fee but a lot of other issues that relate more broadly to the operation of our refugee program and our humanitarian program onshore. Subsequent to this inquiry taking place, the Senate has agreed to look more broadly at the operation of our refugee program via the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which the previous speaker is the chair of. Hopefully, we will be able to look in more detail at some of those issues.</para></talk.start><para>The reason that reference was agreed to is that I think it is recognised by people coming 
 from many different perspectives of the debate surrounding refugee issues that these are complex issues and issues of great importance which involve quite fundamental and vital matters of human rights. It is also a question of addressing those through specific practical mechanisms. Of course, there is the problem of ensuring that those fundamental human rights are addressed using a system which, unfortunately, some people do choose to abuse. I think that does give rise to difficulties in terms of how best to address those problems of abuse. It is obviously not in the interests of genuine asylum seekers to have their access to justice and access to the system affected by other people who are abusing that system. So I think it is in everybody's interests to try and examine mechanisms to minimise abuse. Obviously those mechanisms need to be ones that do not compromise a fundamental necessity for our humanitarian program to address the human rights of genuine asylum seekers.</para><para>It is worth making the point in relation to this specific issue, as with any issue relating to the broader humanitarian program, that just because people seeking asylum appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal and are knocked back, that does not automatically mean that they are deliberately abusing the system. I think that implication was raised a number of times during the course of inquiry—that this somehow or other the number of people who are unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal could be broadly equated with the number of people who are abusing the system. Quite clearly that is not a fair assessment to make. The legal definition in relation to getting refugee status in Australia is quite narrow and there are many people in what are quite clearly situations of genuine humanitarian need who do not technically fit within that definition. They still go through the system because they have a genuine need to seek asylum. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the ministerial discretionary power exists—to address some of those people who do not fit neatly into the legal definition but nonetheless have a genuine humanitarian case.</para><para>This current minister has been reasonably active in trying to acknowledge some of those 
 special cases. All those people have to go through the Refugee Review Tribunal process to get to the minister and to get him to exercise his discretion. He  obviously does not exercise his discretion in favour of everybody that seeks it, but quite a reasonable number of those people could easily and credibly claim to be genuine asylum seekers, not abusers of the system. All of those people are subject to this $1,000 fee that the committee was investigating. The $1,000 fee was brought in a couple of years ago in conjunction with a number of other measures which were aimed at addressing alleged abuses of the system. The Democrats opposed those measures at the time and voted in favour of a disallowance motion which Senator Margetts moved, from memory. It was before I came into this chamber. I think my colleague Senator Stott Despoja, who handled the matter for the Democrats at that time, supported Senator Margetts's concerns. In many ways some of the other changes that were made that will still remain in place and have no sunset clause have the potential to cause greater injustice than this $1,000 post-decision fee measure which is subject to a sunset clause.</para><para>One of the other difficulties with this inquiry was trying to separate the effect the $1,000 post-decision fee might have had on reducing abuse of the system from the effects of all the other measures that were brought in at the time. The committee, and I think even the department, had to acknowledge that it really was not able to be done. It was not possible to separate the impact of the $1,000 from the impact of all the other different measures that were also brought in.</para><para>I take the point Senator McKiernan made that, in some respects, the changes have been in operation for such a short length of time that it is a bit difficult to draw conclusive conclusions about the impacts of the measures. It is still taking a while for them to work their way through the system. I would acknowledge that point but turn it around the other way and say that the onus should be on proving that these measures do not impair genuine asylum seekers from seeking asylum. Clearly, it is also a fundamental requirement 
 of our refugee system that we do not unfairly or unreasonably deter genuine asylum seekers. I think that is where the burden of proof must lie and, if we are taking a precautionary approach, that is the approach that we must take. I do not think that that was able to be clearly established either. When we are looking at wanting to get evidence about whether genuine asylum seekers have been deterred by this fee or by genuine hardship, we need to prove it from the other direction just as much as prove that it is having a negative impact. It is for that reason that I lent my name to the minority aspect of this report.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise and concur with the thanks to the committee secretariat for their role in this inquiry. I emphasise again that the whole aspect of our humanitarian refugee program is an important one and one that there is great public interest in. There are a range of opinions about how best to deal with some of these difficult issues. We recognise the fact that we cannot help every single genuine refugee on the planet, but we do need to make sure that Australia not only plays its part but also does not do anything which acts against genuine asylum seekers and sends genuine asylum seekers back to a situation of danger. That is something else that we need to ensure.</para><para>It is obviously important to stop abuse, and the Democrats acknowledge that. We acknowledge that there is a level of abuse, although perhaps it is not as high as is sometimes suggested. But it is also equally important to ensure that the system operates in a way that does not negate our basic human rights obligations. That is the perspective from which I approach this issue. The Democrats approach these issues more broadly in relation to the operation of our refugee program. It is an issue that will be an ongoing one and one that I am sure we will revisit a number of times in this chamber in the future. It is appropriate that we should, given that it is an issue of such public interest and public importance. I look forward to ongoing and constructive debate from all sides as we try, together, to work out the best possible system for meeting our basic human rights obliga 
 tions in relation to refugees and our humanitarian program.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>5742</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>5742</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5742</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Gibson, I present report No. 368 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of Audit Report No. 34, 1997-98—New submarine project—Department of Defence</inline> .

I propose to highlight those aspects of the submarine project about which the Committee has the most concern.</para><para>The Committee held three public hearings in 1998 and 1999 to take evidence on the submarine project. In April this year, members of the Committee went to the Australian Submarine Corporation's premises at Port Pirie to inspect the facilities and the Collins submarine, <inline font-style="italic">Dechaineux.</inline></para><para>At the invitation of the Australian Submarine Corporation I took the opportunity on 28 and 29 April this year to sail on boat 4, the <inline font-style="italic">Dechaineux.</inline>  I spoke at length with the submarine's officers and crew, and ASC personnel. I want to say that it was absolutely fabulous and one of the greatest experiences of my life to drive a 740 million dollar machine underwater.</para><para>While not all of my colleagues will agree with me, much of what I have seen and heard during this inquiry and on my inspection supports the contention that the Collins class submarine, built largely in Australia and with over 70 per cent Australian industry involvement, is one of the country's great technological achievements.</para><para>However, the expectation that the superior Collins submarines would by now have taken up the capability of the paid-off Oberons has not been realised. Instead, Navy is confronted with a submarine fleet reduced from six operational Oberon class 
 submarines, to one operational Oberon class submarine, and a far greater reduction in operational capability than the reduction anticipated by Defence at the start of the project.</para><para>This has resulted in significant training difficulties for Navy because it has to provide training over an extended period to run two capabilities, the Oberons and the Collins, side by side. Having only one fully operational submarine has added to the training problems. The delays in delivery of software, the continuing need for rectification of defects and completion of contractor sea trials are affecting submarine force structure and morale.</para><para>Technical difficulties have been experienced with the software used to integrate the combat systems functions. The combat system does not function as an integrated system resulting in the submarines' current combat system capability falling below planned capability.</para><para>The submarines have a number of as yet unresolved design and system problems, and while there is optimism that these will be overcome, the Commonwealth remains exposed to significant areas of risk as long as the submarines remain less than fully operational.</para><para>Despite Defence's assurances that there will be no ongoing additional costs to the Commonwealth because of the fixed price nature of the submarine project contract, it will be difficult to distinguish with certainty between what additional costs to taxpayers may result from design and engineering shortfalls and what are legitimate reconfiguration costs to meet new Defence requirements.</para><para>The Audit Report on the submarine project criticised aspects of the Project Office's management of quality assurance issues and project progress monitoring. The Audit Report also expressed concern about the expenditure of over 95 per cent of the project funds, when a substantial proportion of outstanding commitments remained to be fulfilled under the contract.</para><para>It is clear to the Committee that the risks in this project have not been handled as well as they might have been, and that the number of defects, particularly in the first two submarines, is evidence of this. Substantial risk still attaches to the submarines' combat system. While it has been assured that the remaining funds should be sufficient for the satisfactory completion of the project, the Committee considers that ongoing schedule changes require more frequent review to reverify that schedule and cost outcomes can be met.</para><para>The Committee considers that continued surveillance by Defence of the estimated cost to complete, and the payment of funds only on earned value, are critical to the outcome of this and other Defence projects.  
</para><para>The Committee considers the fact that the operational submarine squadron consists of one aging Oberon, is a poor reflection on Defence's management of the submarine project and its force strategy planning. The fact that Defence has not yet accepted any Collins submarines into naval service highlights the unrealistic nature of Defence's initial expectation that it would by now have five operational Collins submarines.</para><para>Defence's very modest contingency plans for delivery delays have led the Committee to recommend that realistic allowances for contingencies be made in delivery schedules for major Department of Defence projects.</para><para>The Committee did not investigate in its hearings the issue of through-life support for the submarines. However, the Committee notes that many submarine support issues remain undetermined and recommends that the Government urgently address the issue of through-life support for the Collins submarines.</para><para>Detailed comments have been made in the report about the unsatisfactory nature of Defence evidence in relation to Defence's payment to ASC's broker of $2.4 million for `insurance services'.</para><para>The report also addresses the issue of access to contractors' premises by the Auditor-General. The Committee is aware that some agencies may seek refuge in the reduced accountability that can occur when services are outsourced to the private sector, and are not as cooperative as they might be in assisting the Auditor-General to access contractors' information and records. In the JCPAA's view, such access is essential to proper management of government contracts and the successful audit of contract outcomes, and the Committee has recommended accordingly. May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee those people who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review hearings.</para><para>I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated much time and effort to reviewing this Auditor-General's report. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiry, Dr Margot Kerley, the Committee secretary, Ms Jennifer Hughson and Ms Tiana Gray.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>5743</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak on this particular issue and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT TO LAWS</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5743</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported, informing the

A number of minor amendments to the gift provisions will also be made.</para><para>Secondly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendments to the capital gains tax provisions</inline></para><para>The bill proposes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by inserting a rewrite of the capital gains tax rules about:</para><para>.	 Small business roll-over and retirement exemption (including an extension to those provisions for land and buildings);</para><para>.	 Value shifts between companies under common ownership;  
</para><para>.	 Assets register entries that eliminate the need for business taxpayers to keep source documents after 5 years; and</para><para>.	 Exempting reimbursements or payments of expenses under the M4/M5 Cashback Scheme for tolls paid on the M4 and M5 toll roads.</para><para>The bill will also correct unintended consequences made by the rewrite of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 resulting from the Tax Laws Improvement Act (No. 1) 1998. In addition some minor amendments will be made to the readability of those rewritten provisions.</para><para>The amendments will apply to assessments for the 1998-99 income year.</para><para>Further the bill will amend the capital gains tax provisions so that public entities (listed public companies, publicly traded unit trusts and mutual insurance organisations) with pre-capital gains tax assets, at 30 June 1999, and thereafter at 5 yearly intervals or if there is abnormal trading, must satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation that they have maintained continuity of majority underlying ownership. If continuity is lost, any pre-capital gains tax assets are treated as post-capital gains tax assets.</para><para>Thirdly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Extension of the Beneficiary Rebate to include CDEP participants</inline></para><para>The bill extends the beneficiary rebate to participants in the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) Scheme in respect of the income support component of their CDEP wages. This will ensure that unemployed members of Indigenous communities who choose to forgo their entitlement to social security allowances to work on CDEP projects will not suffer any taxation disadvantage compared with recipients of unemployment allowances, such as the Newstart Allowance.</para><para>And lastly,</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Providing taxation information to State law enforcement agencies</inline></para><para>This bill also amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information to the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and the Queensland Crime Commission, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been or is being committed, or is relevant to the making, or proposed or possible making, of a proceeds of crime order.</para><para>Full details of the amendments in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para></para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (DEMUTUALISATION OF NON-INSURANCE MUTUAL ENTITIES) BILL 1999</para><para>The Treasurer announced in the 1998-99 Budget the Government's intention to introduce a generic taxation framework applying to demutualisations of mutual non-insurance organisations. This bill introduces that generic framework. The framework will apply to demutualisations completed on or after 12 May 1998.</para><para>The Government has consulted widely with interested parties on the implementation of the generic framework. The consultation period followed the release of an Issues Paper on 28 May 1997.</para><para>The framework applies to a demutualisation that occurs under one of three specified methods. All of the methods broadly require that the interests of members in the mutual organisation be extinguished in exchange for ordinary shares.</para><para>The framework will only apply to those demutualisations where broad continuity of beneficial interest is maintained. However, a small proportion of demutualisation shares can be issued to non-members.</para><para>The framework provides that capital gains tax will not apply to the surrender by a member of membership interests in the demutualising entity. Any capital gains tax liability will therefore be deferred until the disposal of the demutualisation shares.</para><para>The framework also establishes, for capital gains tax purposes, the date and cost of acquisition of shares acquired by former members as part of the demutualisation process. Broadly, the cost of acquisition for pre-CGT members will be determined by reference to the member's share of the market value of the demutualising entity immediately before demutualisation. For post-CGT members, the cost will be determined by reference to the costs incurred by the member in acquiring and maintaining membership to the extent that those costs are not deductible.</para><para>In addition, the framework will allow demutualising entities to retain any franking account surpluses accumulated before demutualisation.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (CPI INDEXATION) BILL 1999</para><para>This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 to 
 give effect to an announcement made in the 1998-99 Budget.</para><para>The bill will provide that various thresholds and rebate amounts in the taxation law that are currently indexed annually in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index will not fall because of a decrease in the CPI.</para><para>The indexation measure in the bill will apply to the 1998-99 income tax, fringe benefits tax and sales tax years and later years.</para><para>The bill will prevent taxpayers being disadvantaged by a reduction in the level of the thresholds and rebate amounts arising from a fall in the CPI as occurred in the 12 month period ending 31 March 1998.</para><para>The bill also makes two minor technical corrections to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.</para><para>The cost to the revenue of the bill is estimated to be insignificant.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1999</para><para>This bill makes miscellaneous amendments to superannuation legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 </inline></para><para>Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 to tighten the arrangements relating to the early release of monies held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve (SHAR) in a manner consistent with arrangements already applying to superannuation funds and retirement savings accounts (RSAs).</para><para>SHAR was set up to accept superannuation contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's superannuation fund will not accept a particular contribution because of rules which require that fees and charges not exceed the interest earned on small amounts. SHAR is administered by the Commissioner of Taxation.</para><para>The amendments contained in Schedule 1 tighten the arrangements on the early release of monies held in SHAR in a manner consistent with the arrangements that already apply to superannuation funds and RSAs by:</para><para>.	 reducing from $500 to $200 the amount that can be withdrawn from SHAR on the ground that the person has ceased employment;</para><para>.	 restricting access to monies in SHAR on the ground that the individual is not an Australian 
 resident, to cases where the person has reached preservation age (currently age 55); and</para><para>.	 replacing access to monies in SHAR on the ground of severe financial hardship with a new objective test based on whether the person has received specified Commonwealth payments for a certain period.</para><para>The amendments are expected to have a negligible financial impact and will take effect on Royal Assent of the bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Non-arm's length trust distributions to superannuation and similar funds</inline></para><para>Schedule 2 of the bill gives effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 25 November 1997 to close a loophole in the current law allowing certain distributions of trust income to superannuation entities made under non-arm's length arrangements to be taxed at the concessional rate of 15 per cent.</para><para>The amendments will ensure that distributions of income from all trusts—other than where the superannuation entity has a fixed entitlement—are taxed at 47 per cent. The amendments will also ensure income distributions, where the superannuation entity has a fixed entitlement to income from the trust, are also taxed at 47 per cent where the distribution is made in connection with a non-arm's length arrangement.</para><para>The amendments are expected to result in a revenue saving of approximately $15 million per annum.</para><para>Subject to a transitional arrangement, the amendments apply to income derived after 2.00pm on 25 November 1997.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Exemption of senior foreign executives from the Superannuation Guarantee</inline></para><para>Schedule 3 of the bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Regulations, to continue from 1 August 1996 an exemption from the Superannuation Guarantee for employers in respect of certain senior foreign executives who meet the criteria for the former class 413 overseas executive visa. The class 413 visa, along with many other business visa classes, was replaced with effect from 1 August 1996 by several new visa classes.</para><para>These amendments will help the internationalisation of the Australian economy by facilitating the movement of highly skilled business executives and specialists into Australia. Senior foreign executives are typically brought to Australia because of their specialist skills and experience and have equivalent or greater retirement income arrangements in place in their home countries.</para><para>The amendments are expected to have a negligible financial impact and will take effect from 1 August 1996.  
</para><para>Full details of the amendments in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</para><para>Today I introduce a bill to modernise the regulation of business and our financial markets.</para><para>The recently enacted reforms to the Australian financial sector, together with the wide ranging reform of Australia's corporate laws proposed under the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, are a launch pad for this Government's drive to make Australia a centre for global financial services. This bill builds the framework for Australia's business regulation to foster economic development and employment. It provides key reforms to our laws in the areas of fundraising, directors' duties, accounting standards and takeovers.</para><para>In March 1997, the Government announced it was taking a new approach to corporate regulation under its Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. The objective of this Program is to promote efficiency in the Australian economy while facilitating market integrity and protecting investors from fraud, negligence or abusive market conduct.</para><para>In developing this new regulatory regime, the Government, in consultation with the business community and interest groups, is seeking to adopt a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework that can respond to market changes. It will permit market participants to adapt to challenges of technological developments, innovation and integration of the world's financial markets.</para><para>Before I detail the reforms in the bill, I should express the Government's appreciation for the contribution of all groups that have participated so actively in the reform program. In particular, the Business Regulation Advisory Group, chaired by Mrs Catherine Walter with representatives from key business groups, which was established to help the Government in the consultation process. In addition, I would like to thank the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for their consideration of the bill.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Corporate Fundraising</inline></para><para>This bill will improve the fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law to facilitate more efficient capital raising by Australian business.</para><para>A range of measures will be implemented to facilitate the raising of investment capital and reduce the high fundraising costs faced by Australian companies. 
</para><para>Prospectuses are often too long and complicated and can obscure information of interest to investors. Issuers frequently complain that they are forced to burden prospectuses with unnecessary information and that prospectus costs are too high.</para><para>The fundraising rules will be improved and costs reduced by:</para><para>.	 introducing short form prospectuses for retail investors with technical information contained in separate documents available on request;</para><para>.	 permitting investors in certain industries to be provided with a short profile statement containing key information rather than the full prospectus; and</para><para>.	 allowing companies to issue prospectuses in electronic form and distribute them through the Internet or other media.</para><para>It is also clear that uncertainty over liability for the content of prospectuses has added to the complexity and expense of fundraising and has detracted from the prime function of a prospectus to disclose relevant information to investors. The Government will clarify the potential liability of parties for prospectuses by providing that their liability is governed solely under the Corporations Law. Due diligence defences will be made available in all cases of fundraising where there is a positive duty to disclose information.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Facilitating Fundraising by Small and Medium Sized Enterprises</inline></para><para>The cost of a prospectus can be excessive in light of the amount of capital small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) seek to raise. This acts as a significant impediment to SMEs seeking public funds.</para><para>A new fundraising mechanism will allow an SME to raise a total of up to $5 million through the use of offer information statements (OIS). The OIS introduces simpler disclosure obligations. Bodies wishing to use an OIS will be required to state the purpose for which the funds are required, the risks involved and include a copy of its audited accounts. Investors will be warned of the risks of investing without a prospectus and the desirability of obtaining professional advice.</para><para>In addition, a prospectus will not be required if a person makes personal offers that result in securities being issued to 20 or fewer persons in a one year period, with no more than $2 million being raised. This will cut the costs faced by SMEs when making small scale offerings without exposing investors to unnecessary risks.</para><para>To facilitate SME fundraising, a company will be able to raise funds from sophisticated investors without preparing a prospectus in a wider range of circumstances. 
</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Clarifying Directors' Duties</inline></para><para>Effective corporate decision-making is hampered by legal uncertainties arising from the liability of directors for their actions. A business judgment rule will be introduced to provide directors with a safe harbour from personal liability in relation to honest, informed and rational business judgments. The rule will apply where an officer makes an informed decision in good faith, without a material personal interest in the subject matter of the decision and rationally believes that the decision is in the best interests of the company.</para><para>The objective of the rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their management duties. It is not designed to, and will not, insulate them from liability for negligent, ill informed or fraudulent decisions. The rule will not lead to any reduction in the level of director accountability, but will ensure that they are not liable for decisions made in good faith and with due care.</para><para>Directors will benefit from the certainty that the rule provides in terms of their liability as they will be encouraged to take advantage of business opportunities and not behave in an unnecessarily risk averse way.</para><para>To reflect modern business practices, directors will, where appropriate, be able to delegate functions to, and rely on advice and information provided by, other persons. The availability of an indemnity for legal actions and directors' liabilities in corporate groups will also be clarified.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Greater Accountability to Shareholders</inline></para><para>A new `representative' action will be introduced to enhance shareholders' rights to pursue an action on behalf of shareholders where the company is unable or unwilling to do so.</para><para>This new right of action will provide an incentive for management to exercise powers appropriately and for the benefit of shareholders. Safeguards will be introduced to ensure that company management is not undermined by unjustified or vexatious litigation. The court will need to be satisfied that proceedings brought on behalf of a company are appropriate in that there must be a serious case to be tried, the applicant must be acting in good faith and the action must be in the best interests of the company.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Making Accounting Standards More Useful for Business</inline></para><para>Financial reporting requirements play an important role in Australian companies' ability to compete effectively and efficiently.</para><para>Accounting standards that are responsive to the needs of the Australian business community and investors have to be developed, thus ensuring that Australia maintains an informed and efficient capital market. 
</para><para>To bring an investor and business focus to the standard setting process, an advisory body, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), will be established with membership drawn from peak professional, business and government organisations. The FRC will have broad oversight of the Australian accounting standard setting process. It will report to the Minister and provide advice on the effectiveness of accounting standards. As a result, the accounting standard setting process will become more responsive to the needs of preparers and users of financial statements.</para><para>A key role of the FRC will be to ensure that the Australian Accounting Standards Board is committed to, and works towards, adopting international standards having regard to what is taking place in major capital raising economies.</para><para>The FRC will report to the Government on the acceptance of international accounting standards in overseas capital markets, on the progress made by the International Accounting Standards Committee on developing a core set of international standards and on the International Organisation of Securities Commission's acceptance of those standards.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Streamlining Takeover Rules</inline></para><para>The current takeover rules are complex and impose excessive costs on bidders and target firms. The bill reforms the current takeover legislation to make requirements simpler and clearer.</para><para>To facilitate a more competitive market for corporate control, a bidder will be able to exceed the takeover threshold (more than 20 per cent of the total voting rights in a company) through a new mandatory bid procedure before being obliged to make a general takeover offer.</para><para>The mandatory bid rule will provide two big advantages. First, by giving potential bidders the choice of which takeover method to employ, they are more likely to proceed with their bids, resulting in an increased likelihood of assets being used in their most productive way. Secondly, the mandatory bid rule will ensure that all target company shareholders will have the opportunity to sell their interest at a fair price and to benefit from the premium a bidder for control places on the securities.</para><para>The conditions generally applying to takeover bids will usually apply to mandatory bids. However, certain other conditions will also apply to mandatory bids to protect minority shareholders. For example, the conditions are designed to ensure that the mandatory bid complies with the equal opportunity principle—that target shareholders be given a fair opportunity to exit the company completely at a fair price. 
</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Takeovers Panel</inline></para><para>To address concerns with the current dispute resolution mechanisms for takeovers, the existing Corporations and Securities Panel will be reconstituted to become the primary forum for resolving takeover matters. The Panel will retain its existing jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the spirit of the Law. It will also be given jurisdiction to review decisions of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on exemptions from the takeover rules given to corporations. All interested parties will be able to bring matters before the Panel, not just ASIC. Court proceedings in relation to a takeover bid or proposed takeover bid will not be able to be started until after the end of the bid period except on the application of ASIC or another public authority of the Commonwealth or a State.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Listed Managed Investments</inline></para><para>Investors will also have the benefit of the takeover rules applying to listed managed investment schemes.</para><para>This program of reforms will ensure that Australia's corporate laws meet the challenges of the present and future marketplace in a forward thinking, responsible and innovative way. The reforms are designed to encourage free enterprise for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities</inline></para><para>On 10 December 1998, the Senate resolved that the provisions of the bill be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report. The Committee released its report into the bill on 12 May.</para><para>In response to the Committee's report, the Government has foreshadowed that it will be moving amendments to the bill to implement almost all of the recommendations of the majority report and a number of the recommendations of the minority reports. The Government will also be moving a number of other amendments necessary to ensure that the stated policy objectives of the bill are appropriately met.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 6) 1999</para><para>This bill makes amendments to the income tax law and other laws to give effect to the following measures:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Spectrum licences</inline></para><para>The measures will implement the proposal announced on 11 March 1998 for a deduction to be allowed for expenditure incurred in acquiring a 
 spectrum licence. The deduction will be allowed over the period of the licence.</para><para>The measures will also amend the law to ensure that Australia is able to assert its taxing rights over income from the use of spectrum where a spectrum licence is owned by a non-resident, including amending the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 and the definition of royalty to include payments for use of spectrum licences.</para><para>The amendments apply to licences obtained from 11 March 1998.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Technical amendments</inline></para><para>Schedules 2, 3 and 4 contain a range of technical amendments to the rewritten income tax law to correct minor errors in translating the fine detail of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</para><para>Schedule 5 includes in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the rewritten education and training payments provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as amended by Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.1) 1997 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Act 1998. It also closes off the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provisions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Provisional tax uplift factor</inline></para><para>This bill will also amend the way in which the provisional tax uplift factor is calculated. The amendments take account of a change in the presentation of the National accounts published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which took effect for the September 1998 quarter.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Youth allowance and austudy payment</inline></para><para>Schedule 7 contains amendments to correct a technical error which occurred in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as a result of amendments contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Act 1998. The amendments also ensure that the rewritten provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is correct.</para><para>The amendments ensure that both youth allowance and austudy payments to full-time students are included in assessable income but subject to the beneficiary rebate, as intended.</para><para>Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (LIFETIME HEALTH COVER) BILL 1999</para><para>This Government is committed to ensuring a balance between the public and private health 
 sectors. This balance will ensure Australians have a level of choice as well as universal access to excellent health care.</para><para>We have demonstrated this commitment through recent reforms to private health insurance including, the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate and loyalty bonuses, the promotion of simplified billing and reforms to make the private health insurance industry more market responsive and flexible.</para><para>These reforms are based on a 1997 inquiry into private health insurance conducted by the Industry Commission and extensive consultation with consumer and industry groups.</para><para>Lifetime Health Cover is another major and important reform arising from this process.</para><para>This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to introduce Lifetime Health Cover into private health insurance.</para><para>Under Lifetime Health Cover, health funds will be required to set different premiums depending on the age at which a member first takes out hospital cover with a registered health fund.</para><para>Lifetime Health Cover encourages people to join a health fund early in life and to maintain their membership and discourages `hit and run' behaviour. All of which increases the stability of the industry and helps to contain the rising cost of health insurance premiums.</para><para>Under Lifetime Health Cover, people who take out hospital cover with a registered organisation before the age of 30 and maintain their membership will pay lower premiums throughout their lifetime relative to people who delay joining.</para><para>People who join after the age of 30 will pay a 2 per cent premium loading for each year that they delay joining.</para><para>The loading is capped at a maximum of 70 per cent above the premium payable by a person who joins at the age of 30.</para><para>To ensure a fair and equitable transition to Lifetime Health Cover, existing members of private health insurance who have hospital cover, no matter what their age, will be treated as if they had joined a fund by the age of 30.</para><para>People currently without private health insurance will be given the chance to join and pay the 30-year-old rate, irrespective of their age, in a twelve-month period of grace from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000.</para><para>Special provisions also apply to older Australians.</para><para>People born before 1 July 1934 can take out hospital cover at any time in the future without paying a loading for joining late in life.</para><para>If people in this age category choose to join a health fund, at any time, they will pay the same premium as a 30-year-old new member. 
</para><para>This Government recognises that people may need to discontinue their private health insurance membership for a period of time due to, for example, a change in income, or an overseas posting. Lifetime Health Cover, therefore, allows people a 24-month absence from private health insurance without a loading being applied to their premium when they return. An individual who is absent for more than 24-months and then returns to private health insurance will incur a loading of 2 per cent on top of their premium for every additional 12-months that they were absent from private health insurance.</para><para>This bill allows for regulations to be drafted to allow health funds to extend the allowed period of absence for individuals in special circumstances.</para><para>It also allows for the Minister for Health and Aged Care to determine that people in exceptional circumstances, who were unable to lock in the lower premium rate on 1 July 2000 due to proven hardship are to be given the base rate premium. Determinations of this kind will be made on an individual basis and regulations will specify the circumstances under which such a determination is able to made.</para><para>Lifetime Health Cover complements the major reforms to private health insurance already undertaken by the Government.</para><para>It delivers another important part of the Government's commitment to reform the private health insurance industry and to maintain the balance between the public and private health sectors.</para><para>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>Waterfront reform is an essential element of the Government's efforts to improve the competitiveness of the Australian economy for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para>In 1998 the Government introduced a series of administrative arrangements designed to facilitate waterfront reform. Those arrangements included the provision of funds to assist stevedores to meet the cost of redundancies that resulted from the implementation of reform and restructuring in the stevedoring industry.</para><para>I am pleased to say that the program announced in 1998 has been an overwhelming success. This Government has succeeded in encouraging real and effective reform on the waterfront.</para><para>Since April 1998 over 800 people have taken redundancy packages from the stevedoring industry and there are more to come. The take up rate of redundancies has been even greater than we could have predicted when the program was announced. 
</para><para>Stevedoring companies across the country both large and small are all reporting the benefits of the Government's reform initiatives. The reforms that have been introduced have assisted stevedoring employers to address many of the key industrial relations issues within their workplaces, which have long stifled productivity. The resultant gains in terms of productivity and operational effectiveness will be consolidated as the restructuring spreads throughout the industry and is bedded down.</para><para>Much still remains to be done however and the Government remains strongly committed to assisting stevedores to introduce further reform. The Government remains equally committed to ensuring that the industry bears any costs associated with the introduction of the changes required, not the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>Let me now turn to the bill. Today I introduce the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Amendment Bill 1999, which delivers on both of these commitments. This bill underpins the Government's commitment that the waterfront reform program would be funded by industry not the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>The bill increases the appropriation within the existing legislation from $250 million to $350 million. The additional funds will be used to meet the greater than anticipated cost of redundancies.</para><para>The increased appropriation will also ensure that there are sufficient funds available for stevedoring companies seeking to implement worthwhile non redundancy related reforms aimed at improving their operations.</para><para>These reforms could include the introduction of new technology such as electronic commerce; or new wharf facilities; occupational health and safety training programs aimed at reducing the rate of injury; or training programs aimed improving the employee's ability to use new equipment.</para><para>The Government will be assessing each proposal carefully, and will only agree to fund those reform initiatives which have objectives or outcomes that are consistent with the Government's seven waterfront reform benchmarks as the basis for continuing improvement.</para><para>This bill will allow this work to continue, by ensuring that the Government has the funds available to assist stevedores to complete their redundancy programs and implement other worthwhile projects, aimed at improving productivity and efficiency.</para><para>The Government has set the rate for the stevedoring levy by regulation at $6.00 per vehicle and $12.00 per container and it is not intended that this be changed. The period for collection of the levy will therefore be extended to raise the necessary funds. The Government believes that this approach provides the best outcome for the industry. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>The Australian stevedoring industry has entered a new era in which employers are restructuring their operations with the aim of achieving world's best practice in productivity and reliability and offering a service that is internationally competitive.</para><para>The Government identified the reforms that needed to be addressed and provided the legal framework to facilitate these changes. This legislation underpins the administrative arrangements already in place and ensures that the vital reforms and restructuring which have commenced will continue.</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</para><para>The bill makes amendments to the income tax law and sales tax law to give effect to the following measures:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 </inline></para><para>The bill amends the sales tax law to correct a deficiency relating to the exemption for goods incorporated into property owned by, or leased to, always-exempt persons or the government of a foreign country.</para><para>Access to the exemption will now be available only where the property is occupied principally by an always exempt person or the government of a foreign country or where the property is used principally for the provision of services to an always exempt person or government of a foreign country. The amendment applies to dealings after 2 April 1998, unless the goods concerned were acquired on or before 2 April 1998.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Arrangements treated as a sale and loan and limited recourse debt </inline></para><para>These amendments were originally introduced as part of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) of 1998. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives and was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The bill lapsed when Parliament was prorogued. Since that time the Government has consulted with professional and industry bodies. Consequently, several technical changes have been made to the legislation as originally introduced.</para><para>The bill will implement a measure announced in the 1997-98 Budget to prevent taxpayers obtaining deductions for capital expenditures in excess of their actual outlays.

 excessive deductions that were allowed to the taxpayer based on the initial cost of the relevant capital asset or specified capital expenditure.

The amendment applies to debts that are terminated after 27 February 1998.</para><para>Two major technical changes to the original bill are concerned with limited recourse debt. First, where a debt is terminated and refinanced on arm's length terms, payments of the terminated debt that are funded by a replacement limited recourse debt will be counted in calculating any adjustment to be made. This will allow investors to refinance assets without adverse tax consequences.</para><para>Secondly, debt will not be treated as limited recourse debt where the conditions of the debt and any associated security arrangements do not have a limiting effect, for example, where ordinary business debts are fully secured by a floating charge over the assets of a debtor (other than the financed asset).</para><para>Another amendment will treat taxpayers who finance assets by hire purchase as the owners of those assets for purposes of applying the various capital allowance deductions. Hire purchase and instalment sale transactions will be treated as the equivalent of sale, loan and debt transactions in assessing the taxation liability of the financier and the hire purchaser respectively.

The reason I want to respond is to explain why the inclusion of a so-called social bonus in relation to the sale of a further part of Telstra is inappropriate. We have seen a number of statements by this government over time in relation to bonuses. We heard, leading up to the 1996 election, all sorts of statements in relation to the bonuses to the environment. What is the reality in that case for the environment? The reality is that the government of course pulled money out of the environment fund—and we have seen a huge drop in total environment funding—so all it was doing was basically using the sale of a public asset as a means of removing support for the provision of other services.</para></talk.start><para>I have just received a letter from the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union—the CEPU—who want to talk about the Rural Transaction Centres Program and the sale of Telstra. I will quote from the letter where they are talking about the decline of rural banking services and in Australia Post outlets:</para><para>In this light we are concerned at recent statements concerning the Rural Transactions Centre Program and its connection to the further sale of Telstra. While the notion of re-establishing basic services such as banking, telecommunications, post and Medicare services in rural areas is laudable, this union fears that key aspects of the RTC program could in fact see a further reduction in services to these areas.</para><para>This is not just a fanciful statement when you look at what happened to the environment program. We objected of course—as many people did—to the fact that you could pick out something that many people support, like a better standard for the environment, and make it contingent on the further sale of part of Telstra. But here we have it again in relation to the provision of social services or the so-called social bonus. I do not believe this government when they indicate that, somehow or other, this is something extra. What I believe is that they will do what they have done before and consider these as 
 optional and only contingent on further sales of assets, such as perhaps the next chunk of Telstra, so I do not wish to give the government credibility on this.</para><para>It is not a matter of giving the government pats on the head when they have done something good; I believe it is a further justification for doing what they are doing and what they will be doing in the future. It is not even a matter of making this bill acceptable, as the ALP has indicated in relation to some amendments. It is a matter of justifying the con that we saw in relation to the first tranche of Telstra, which has—quite clearly and demonstrably—simply been an excuse for pulling out funding from areas that most Australians think are important, and quite clearly the government can be shown in the Senate and in the budget papers to have done so.</para><para>Here we have a situation where perhaps we are making these important services dependent on this and further sales of Telstra, and therefore the funding for those issues simply falls off if there are no further sales of such assets coming. So it is not just a slip of the mind by the Greens (WA) in not including that contingent on the sale of Telstra. We believe that those issues are things that the community does believe governments have a responsibility to fund. They should not be contingent on the sale of Telstra because, as has clearly been demonstrated, the ongoing revenue from the sale of Telstra and other public assets could in fact be used for the provision of these kinds of services and it does not require the sale to justify these services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5756</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to put some questions to the minister at this point about the social bonus package. I note that the minister's press release of 8 March talks about $150 million in funding which is going to install telecommunications infrastructure for untimed local call access to 37,000 families and households who live in outer extended zones in remote Australia and to replace the pastoral call with a much fairer preferential call rate. I want to ask the minister whether this addresses the criticism which was put by the Isolated Children's Parents Association, who said in their submis 
 sion that isolated families feel as though they have been slighted by the government's social bonus package.</para></talk.start><para>The association will not accept the `ageing Telstra' argument that the provision of untimed local calls within an extended zone between neighbouring extended zones and to local service towns will cause excessive congestion. It says Telstra have never produced documentation to support their argument. It says isolated families living in the outer extended zone will receive very little benefit from this social bonus; they will still have timed calls to their service town, their School of Distance Education, their children boarding at the local boarding facilities, their local doctor, their local banks and their local Internet provider. The list goes on to include virtually every service and social contact that is accessible untimed to their urban counterparts. The association says:</para><para>This is not a cost issue—</para><para>and it goes on to say—</para><para>the issue is one of equity, of comparable benefits, of implementing and enforcing solid legislation reassuring isolated rural/remote dwellers that their interests can be protected by the universal service obligation and that they need not fear further privatisation and sale of Telstra.</para><para>I wonder at this point if the minister could respond to that criticism.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5757</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The provision of up to $150 million to provide untimed local calls in remote Australia is a huge breakthrough. Until now there were very significant areas of land occupied by a relatively small number of people who were simply required to pay for long distance calls—and indeed often even the preferential rate was only, I think, four minutes for 25c—and Telstra always ran this argument that, if you were to somehow do what we are now proposing to do, that would clog up the system. We therefore made that money available in order to put the hardware and infrastructure in place so that Telstra does not have that threshold argument to run.</para></talk.start><para>But if you were to go further than that and to effectively advocate, as Senator Allison's quotation seems to do, that there should be 
 local calls between extended zones, you would be effectively ripping up the whole notion of call zones. You would be having calls that might be 1,000 or 2,000 kilometres apart but, because they happen to fall between two defined extended zones, they would become a 25c untimed local call. Whilst there are those who would argue quite radically that the true cost of calls does not come close to the actual calling rate, it is a big step to argue that you should effectively treat Australia as one local call zone, or that you should treat states as one local call zone or large areas of sparse population as one call zone.</para><para>Whilst the transmission cost, once the equipment is in place, may be not nearly as high as it is now, the fact is that the rollout is what often costs a lot of the money. Certainly, you defeat the whole notion of call zones if you are able to convert two extended zones into one local call zone. You would certainly do away with the notion of community calls and even a preferential rate. People who were 50 kilometres outside the metropolitan area would say, `This is ludicrous. Why shouldn't we have a local call rate when people who are thousands of kilometres away from each other in extended outer zones are able to have local call rates?' The cascading effect of that sort of comparative justice would cause the collapse of the whole zoning system. What we have done is to make it, we think, a lot fairer. That is quite some distance away from arguing that there should not be any zones at all. From what I heard of your proposal, that is getting pretty close to it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">ALLISON</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—Minister, it is not my proposal.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—The one you were quoting.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>5757</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The reason I rise to speak—</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Alston interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Listen, bonehead, you are doing about as well as Collingwood are at the moment, footballwise.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>—There can only be one reason why you're here, and that's to fill in time. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—To try to fill your head in would be a better description, Minister.

One relates to call zones. The minister responded to Senator Allison on the basis of a suggestion that the Democrats may have made or alluded to that you get rid of all call zones. There is no doubt that there are some areas in Australia—and the technology is making it available—where the cost of the present structure of STD call zones should be rapidly moving in favour of the consumer.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One thing I want to put on record here—unfortunately, Senator Harradine is not in the chamber—is that in the deal that he has done with the government in getting extra funding for everything that apparently moves and does not move in Tasmania the one thing I have not seen in the press is his taking up the suggestion that we made at the last election to have all of Tasmania included as one local call zone. Obviously that proved very popular in Tasmania. We won five seats out of five and we won three senators out of six. It was the worst Liberal Party result, I think, since 1972 or 1974. That was a regional development issue for Tasmania. Of course, we know that Eric Abetz was helping us all the time, just by being there.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator O'Brien interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Jocelyn was handing him back.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—The help from my Tasmanian colleagues I cannot ignore. It is true that the quality of the Liberal Party in Tasmania did help us significantly in winning the five seats and at least half the Senate seats for Tasmania. The minister may correct me: Senator Harradine may have this on the list and you may have agreed to it. But for all the individual lumps of money that he has got for Tasmania—there is investment overwhelmingly in capital equipment, in one-off projects and in improving the infrastructure for expansion of the Internet and so on—everybody in Australia knows that the fundamental issue about getting people access to the new forms 
 of communication overwhelmingly is the cost, the charging rate. From what we were able to calculate, if the whole of Tasmania became one local call zone it would cost Telstra, in revenue, no more than $25 million a year, from a revenue of $17 billion. We saw this as a way of encouraging economic and regional development for the whole of Tasmania by reducing the costs, in particular, of small business in Tasmania doing their business within Tasmania.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As the minister represents small business in the chamber, I thought that might have resonated with him a little. This is not a large amount of money. When we did our calculation and announced it, I did not see the minister throwing hand grenades or bombs at it as a crazed idea: he just ignored it. I did not see any announcement from Telstra that this would send them broke and that it was a terrible decision on their charging system. I hope I can stand to be corrected, that this is the one thing that Senator Harradine may have got for Tasmania—that is, the abolition of the STD charging zones, that a phone call from anywhere to anywhere in Tasmania will be at the untimed rate of 25c per call.</para><para>If Senator Harradine has not got that on his agenda to negotiate with the government, I think he has given Tasmania away very cheaply. This is not a one-off amount that is paid and then disappears: it is $25 million a year for this year and every year thereafter. Every year thereafter there is a significant reduction in communication costs in Tasmania. I am more than a little surprised why Senator Harradine would not put this on the agenda and demand that this be the fundamental benefit that Tasmania would get. He knows how popular this is in Tasmania. He knows that the opposition is still committed to this policy.</para><para>In the first shadow ministry meeting held in Tasmania after the election, the first policy that Kim Beazley, on behalf of the Labor Party, recommitted us to for the next election was turning Tasmania into one local call zone. It was very popular policy in Tasmania, and it is extremely important for the economic development of Tasmania to get their cost structure down. I have not yet seen all the 
 details of the deal, but I find it extraordinary that Senator Harradine would have missed this one on the way through. If he had forced it out of you, we may have ground our teeth a little and showed some chagrin that our excellent idea had been taken over by Senator Harradine, but at least the Tasmanian people would have got what undoubtedly would have been an improvement in their communications costs.</para><para>Minister, through Telstra, all the regulatory organisations and your own department you have access to more information than all the rest of us on this side, and you know as well as we do that the cost per unit of making a call from anywhere in Australia is rapidly coming down. The real issue is: who is going to benefit from cheaper calls—the shareholders you want to take over the company or all Australians, the whole 18 million? The best way to provide them with cheaper calls is to ensure that the present inherited structure of STD call zones, which has been around now for nearly 30 years, changes. It should not be used as a way of gouging profits out of people in regional Australia to go into the bottom line of Telstra. We want some benefit to go back to the consumer.</para><para>The technology has changed rapidly in only the last three or four years to allow this to occur. We do not mind that the Australian people get the benefit. That is why we are in favour of full public ownership of Telstra. Even if they were making some excess profit at the consumer end, it would always come back to the consumer as a dividend to the government which would be reinvested in Australia. With your policy of privatisation you will get 16 per cent out of Senator Harradine. We believe you have to get serious about ensuring that all the telecommunications consumers, particularly in regional Australia, start getting the benefit of what technology can provide in calls around Australia. Although we may not yet be able to agree with some suggestion that the whole of Australia should be one local call zone, there is no doubt that if technology and switching equipment continue to develop at the present pace, the cost of making calls from anywhere to anywhere in Australia will be extremely cheap 
 indeed and those benefits should be available to all consumers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5759</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to follow up my first question. Minister, I was not asking that untimed local calls be available across Australia, although like Senator Schacht I agree it is time we had a good look at that—it ought to be affordable. My question is specifically about rural and remote dwellers. The ask from the Isolated Children's Parents Association—again, I think it is reasonable—was that rural remote dwellers have untimed local calls within the customer's extended zone. That is not anywhere in Australia but between neighbouring extended zones and between their extended zones and their nearest service centre. We are not asking for all calls everywhere to be untimed; simply, we are asking for some of the benefits which those who live in rural areas enjoy over and above isolated dwellers. That was my point.</para></talk.start><para>There are such generous parts of this package for things like continuous mobile phone coverage along 11 of the nation's busiest highways, which again I would argue is of more benefit to urban dwellers, people who travel from city to city and those people in the not so remote regional areas. This is not going to benefit people who are a long distance from any sort of centre. I would argue that we have very generous telecommunications packages for people who already have reasonably good access, but not for this very important group of people for whom the costs of, and the lack of, telecommunications services are really serious problems. I ask the minister for his comment on my first remarks.</para><para>The next point in the submission is that the telephone rebate scheme does not address the legislated right of the majority of people who live and work in remote rural areas, unless they personally are the registered subscribers on the phone line on which they make their calls. There are many families in remote areas with children in distance education who will still pay full STD rates to contact their teacher.</para><para>The government has accepted Telstra's preferred model of providing a comparable benefit to untimed local calls instead of 
 listening to the people who live in remote rural areas. No other people in Australia have a cap on their local call expenditure, so why should these residents be any different? Many of these isolated remote rural residents are women who  through necessity teach their children via distance education. They can be caring for children with disabilities or medical problems and ageing family members, and are not the actual subscriber on the phone. So they do not receive a rebate and hence no untimed local call, as remote rural residents are experiencing.</para><para>It is very important that there can be networking between residents. They should know that they are not alone but are supported in their isolation and need for contact. And they should not have to worry about incurring a high expense. It should be at an untimed local call rate. Minister, can you respond to those very important pleas in this submission from the Isolated Children's Parents Association?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>5760</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure that I fully understand the point but, to the extent that your concerns about distance education revolve around children being able to have access to the Internet at local call rates, the $36 million that we are providing will do just that. In other words, everyone in Australia will have the capacity to hook onto the Internet at local call charges. Indeed, I give credit to Senator Boswell for squeezing the last $11 million out of us on that front to ensure that it was a truly universal scheme. Beyond that, if you are arguing that people in remote areas should simply be able to make local calls irrespective of where the call is, I am afraid that goes against the logic of zones.

Within six years that amount would reach the $150 million under your program and after that there would be a net saving. That is the point we wish to make.

Talk about selective treatment! I do not know by what logic that could be extended to Tasmania, other than, as Senator Schacht quite ingenuously says, `It helped us win two seats.'

In schedule 2 there is an allocation of $1.35 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust. Part 9, clause 43 gives the simplified outline of this part: rural transaction centres—$75 million over five years; extended access to untimed local calls—$150 million over three years; meeting the telecommunications needs of people in isolated island communities in the Antarctic Territory; Internet access for people in rural and regional areas—$36 million over three years; mobile phone coverage along 
 highways—$25 million; and a range of other matters. Later on in schedule 2, divisions 2, 3, 4 and 5 essentially establish the funds and provide authority for allocation of the funds and presumably, in due course, for disbursement of those funds by the relevant agencies of departments that have been given that responsibility.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday there was a series of press releases: three or four by the minister, one by Senator Ian Campbell, one by the minister for regional affairs, Mr Anderson, joint press releases from three or four government senators from Tasmania and a couple of press releases from joint coalition senators in Queensland. They outlined, from a range of perspectives, the additional $314 million that the government has allocated by way of social bonus in this process. There was a range of descriptions, and the minister's press release is quite comprehensive in the detail of the social bonus. The BITS program gets $158 million; the BARN program, Building Additional Regional Networks, $70 million; Networking the Nation local government fund, $45 million; expanded mobile phone coverage, $3 million—a little sweetie given to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania for no apparent reason apart from the fact that they did not qualify for other programs, which is a useful precedent; and Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Services—TIGERS—which we will return to.</para><para>There will be environmental spending, money for connecting Tasmanian schools and a couple of little beauties down there: an athletics centre in Tasmania is going to have its track upgraded to the value of $600,000, and there will be a couple of other minor allocations of funds in Tasmania. So there is $314 million in addition to the $670-odd million already allocated as part of the social bonus.</para><para>I was interested in Senator Margetts's earlier comments when she responded to matters raised by Senator Allison. She hit the nail right on the head when she said that, as far as her party was concerned, no-one seriously quarrels with the proposition that a lot of the programs outlined for funding in the social bonus are worthy programs, and that 
 people in rural and remote areas should have access over time, at sound cost, to the same sorts of programs that we in the cities regard as basic. Indeed, most of the little beauties that have been added down in Tasmania are probably worthwhile programs in their own right.</para><para>There is no real reason to be overtly critical of the nature of their programs but probably good reason to be critical of the allocation of funds and why it is so critical to allocate $158 million here and $40 million there to things in Tasmania. I am sure all Tasmanians think it is a wonderful idea, but if the programs do not stand on their own merits, it raises interesting issues of public policy as to why they are being funded. To finish that point, Senator Margetts from the Greens was correct. I think the additional programs outlined in terms of the rural transaction centres, untimed local calls, remote island communities, Internet access for people in rural or regional areas and mobile phone coverage along highways are all worthwhile things. One would have thought that with the ever decreasing cost of technology—the ever decreasing cost of telecommunications around the world and in this country—these relatively modest programs would have been funded by government over time as part of its obligation to the sensible allocation of taxpayers' funds.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—It's a dividend.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—It is indeed the dividend. The government is taking $1.8 billion a year out of Telstra. The opposition does not quarrel with that. Indeed, with the growth in the telecommunications market, the switch and the huge growth in volume of data transference, the huge growth in Internet access, uptake and use both at consumer and business level, it is no surprise that the price of Telstra and other telecommunications shares have risen, continue to rise and will probably rise more so in the next couple of years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of the allocation of $1.8 billion—approaching $2 billion—that the government receives in dividends, a modest amount is allocated to a range of modest initiatives. The series of press releases outlined the detail of those yesterday. But I ask the minister: when 
 does the government intend to legislate for that improved package of benefits totalling $314 million? When will we receive the amendments in this chamber, or this parliament, that address the improvements that have been negotiated with Senator Harradine? 	 The current bill reflects government commitments at the last election. They said up-front that there was a social bonus of $671 million. They predicated the implementation of the programs they outlined on the sale of the next 16 per cent, so it is a contingent social bonus, if you like. We say it should have occurred out of normal planning by DCITA and normal allocation of government funds to fairly modest and basic improvements in the telecommunications infrastructure in this country. Nonetheless, the government went down another path. They won the election, and this bill we are discussing now reflects their election commitment. We do not quarrel with that.</para><para>In the last two weeks there have been a series of negotiations, presumably between Minister Alston and Senator Harradine. In Senator Harradine's second reading contribution a fortnight or three weeks ago, he indicated a number of markers. He said he was inclined—in fact, he said it more strongly than that—to support the sale of the next 16 per cent. He ruled out the other 51 per cent, and he indicated that either he or someone would move an amendment to delete schedule 3 at the appropriate time. But, in terms of his critical remarks about price—and most things, if not all things, come down to price—Senator Harradine indicated his price was relocation of structural and management functions to Tasmania, and that has been ticked off. He indicated his price was not low paid or low valued or minimum wage jobs in Tasmania but high value jobs in management and administrative fields, and that has been ticked off. He indicated that he wanted Tasmania to receive a significant net additional investment from government—that there were significant economic and structural problems in that state.</para><para>He did not say it then but he has said at other times that there is a population decline. Young people leave that state to go to the 
 mainland—to Melbourne and Sydney—to seek careers, homes and families elsewhere because there is perceived to be a lack of opportunity for their careers post the age of 18 when they leave high school in Tasmania. So he indicated that the third thing to be ticked off was allocation of significant funds to universities, research institutions and think tanks in modern new and emerging technologies. Again, the $40 million for the development of Tasmania as an intelligent island has been ticked off.</para><para>So all of the markers that Senator Harradine laid down in his second reading comments when the debate closed have been accommodated by the government, and the opposition is not overly critical of that. But what we do want to know is a little more than what is going on by way of press release. The nine or 10 press releases from the joint coalition senators in Queensland, the one from Mr Anderson and a range of others, including one from Parliamentary Secretary Campbell, all rehashed old ground. There was nothing new in those press releases. The press release of consequence was Minister Alston's. Also of consequence, of course, was the joint press release from the coalition senators in Tasmania.</para><para>It is interesting to observe the process of negotiations because the social bonus totals in the order of almost $1 billion. Tasmania's population is something less than two per cent of the total of this country—might be a little bit more.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>—It is 2.6.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name></talker><para>—It is 2.6 per cent, I am told by the Minister. The state's gross state product is also less than 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP, but the total allocation of funds in the social bonus, to 2.6 per cent of the population, is in excess of 15 per cent of the social bonus. That raises a whole range of equity, access, administrative and merit issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition does not quarrel with the upgrading of an athletics track in the city of Hobart to make it modern. If the same principle is to be applied, we would probably like to have new hockey fields in Western Australia, where the bulk of the Australian 
 Hockeyroos come from; we would probably like to have new and additional swimming pools in New South Wales; we would probably like to have new archery fields in Victoria; and we would probably like to have new kayak and other facilities in Queensland, because in each of those states, for whatever reason, the local population has developed expertise or excellence in those particular sports.</para><para>If the principle is that you can whack out $600,000 by the Commonwealth to upgrade an athletics track—you beaut, we will be into that and we will have a couple of million dollars here for a hockey field and $5 million for a swimming pool there. It seems to be a new approach to public policy. If that is the name of the game, the opposition is not slow; we will give that some thought and come to you with a range of propositions and I am sure you will adopt them in due course.</para><para>What we need to come to grips with is: when will we see the amendments to this bill that provide the structure for the allocation of this additional $314 million? It is a lot of money: $158 million for Building IT Strengths, and $40 million to develop Tasmania as an intelligent island. I notice in passing that in a range of the other programs—Building Additional Rural Networks, BARN (don't we love acronyms in this place?) and Networking the Nation Local Government Fund, $45 million—the funds allocated to each of those programs has simply been divided up. The aggregate total has been divided by the six states and a few extra bob thrown in for the two territories.</para><para>In terms of all of those other programs, if the allocation is $50 million, they have given $45 million divided by six for each of the states and the other $6 million divided by two for the two territories, the ACT and the Northern Territory. A different approach appears to apply to BARN, Networking the Nation, the expanded mobile phone coverage, Netwatch, the TIGERS program—although that is in Tasmania only—and the additional environmental spending.</para><para>When will the amendments come forward? Do you intend that they be part of the discussion that we are currently engaged in? Sched 
 ule 2 is the appropriate place for those additional amendments to be discussed. Are we, therefore, going to be doing it as part of this process? Or do you simply intend to implement the additional $314 million by administrative action once the programs have been established, or will you bring the amendments to this bill for discussion at a later time?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5767</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an interesting, if not extraordinarily discursive, contribution from Senator Bishop.

The BARN program—and I pause to pay tribute to the acronym deviser extraordinaire in my office, Mr Fletcher—and the Networking the Nation Local Government Fund are both going to be dealt with through the existing Networking the Nation program. There may be additional administrative measures that will need to be developed, but generally we do not see a need for legislation. These are clearly commitments that will be honoured in the same way that the package that we took to the last election was honoured.</para><para>I should say in passing that, if you want the ultimate example of a pork-barrel, it has to be that Mandurah commitment of Mr Beazley's. I could not believe that he would have the cheek to put that out selectively by local press release or local brief to the media—we could not actually find the press release. What I did find quite extraordinary, to compound the felony, was that when he argued that we should be using the existing Telstra dividend for a range of other initiatives, he conceded that that was money that was already being spent on other social programs. Although this notion of somehow hypothecating the dividend was sold as a new initiative, there was nothing to it. There was no money attached to it because the money was already there.</para><para>The Labor Party now seems to have learnt very quickly from Senator Allison's pre-lunch contribution that what Mr Beazley did yesterday was a massive blue, getting out there and 
 bagging the whole concept of helping the bush rather than saying, `No, they are good in principle but you have to find the money from somewhere so we would find it from the dividend.' You would suffer from the same problem. All that money is already allocated. You did not go to the last election promising to spend anything like $671 million. In fact, Senator Schacht's lasting contribution to the Labor Party's defeat was that he went out there and said that they would close down Networking the Nation—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—He did not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—He did.

It is an in-joke in Telstra in Tasmania and nationally that they are counting the sleeps until 30 June so that they do not have to be bothered with Tasmania and Telstra anymore. In fact, the CEO of Telstra has made comments to, as I understand it, a group of middle managers—if I am wrong, I am sure the minister will correct me—to the effect that he is not very interested in what happens in the Senate in relation to Telstra and staffing levels in Tasmania and that Telstra will be making the decisions in terms of staffing levels. That is correct. That is why the minister cannot answer any of these questions about staffing levels. He cannot give commitments in relation to prospective redundancies. We know—and it is the worst kept secret in Tasmania—that a number of redundancies have been put on hold until after 30 June.</para><para>The question I would again ask the minister is: given that Senator Harradine loses his position of influence on 30 June, how can it be empirically guaranteed that the deal that has been done with him will be carried out, given that deal 1, tranche 1 was not carried out, that we are still waiting for a number of initiatives and that a number of the commitments that were given were breached?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5768</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If there is one thing I ought to make perfectly clear, it is that we are not expecting the Labor Party to take anything on trust because we know their position.

The centres will build on and complement existing generally available programs, including R&amp;D Start, the R&amp;D tax concession and the innovation investment funds. The Commonwealth will call for suitably expert agencies, whether they are state government based, private sector, academic institutions or a combination, to operate the centres. The designs will be flexible. It is 
 expected that involvement of relevant tertiary institutions and venture capitalists will form a key element of all centre proposals. Selection criteria for managers will focus on factors such as business skills and experience, knowledge of the information industries, extent of state government and private sector support and involvement, the ability to contribute to regional development objectives and the likely impact of the centres on commercialisation of R&amp;D.

One target group for project based concept development funding will be multimedia content developers, who often face greater difficulties than other businesses in attracting finance for their operations because of the nature of their work. Once again there is sufficient flexibility in the program hopefully to address a very significant proportion of the needs in this area.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>5770</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for that response, because it clearly indicates that the funds are not going to be allocated on the same basis as the other two programs that I identified.

You might advise us whether there is any capacity for operational costs to be covered by the grants and whether that is intended to be covered from other sources.

At the same time it is not intended to be an ongoing, forever and a day support arrangement. The fact is that this is probably a critical time to be providing this sort of assistance because IT&amp;T is really starting to take off, as you would know. Electronic commerce is only in its infancy. It is predominantly business to business but it is likely to move to business to consumer in the near future, and there are enormous opportunities there. You have only got to listen to people like John Chambers from Cisco, who says that less than one per cent of American households currently have high-speed access to the Internet. The prices that are currently being charged are equivalent to the prices charged for cable television, which services something like 70 per cent of households in America.</para></talk.start><para>It is yet another example of the information age only really just starting.

 want to set aside funds over a 10-year period.

Taking Victoria first, the Victorian government has a de facto industry policy, for want of a better description, in terms of the development of multimedia. In New South Wales there has been a significant, indeed a huge, allocation of funds to locate the Fox Corporation there in terms of film manufacturing, film processing and film production. Indeed, the same thing happened to a lesser extent in Queensland. Do you anticipate the funds allocated to the BITS program being able to be accessed by the governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland for the funding of particular programs or issues of concern, or are they going to be ruled out in terms of having access to the funding?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>5771</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think we would probably adopt the same approach that we took to Networking the Nation. Whilst it is a Commonwealth program and it is designed to provide direct funding, we certainly do not want to deprive ourselves of access to advice from state governments. We would very much encourage them to give us a statewide view of what their needs might be. In relation to the incubator centres, for example, we say that we will call for suitably expert agencies, whether state government based or others, to operate the centres. They would not be ruled out from a place in that particular element.</para></talk.start><para>I do not envisage that it is simply another means of funding state programs; they are meant to be Commonwealth. The Common 
 wealth Technology Port, for example, at the Docklands in Melbourne, is probably an area that might be of particular interest. Certainly, Melbourne has already established itself as a multimedia centre. There are hundreds of small to medium sized enterprises on the south bank of the Yarra alone, let alone clustering around places like La Trobe University and RMIT. It will very much depend on the level of activity that is already in place. I would think a program like this would actually attract a lot more bids as well.

Besides the no doubt long debate that there will be over the GST package and the attendant diesel fuel levy rebate package, which is designed of course to give a massive hand-out to supporters of the government, there is going to be debate on a number of other pieces of legislation which in no way can be seen as urgent.</para></talk.start><para>One of those is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that I will see in my period in this Senate. Other senators may disagree with that because they do not count the environment as being a matter of importance, but I do—and I have the support of greens right around this country when I say that. Among the two pieces of legislation which the government has listed here is a bill to change the whole nature of the administration of environmental law in this country. This bill, which purports to bring up to date—after 20 years of serial environmental change—the laws of this country, is effectively a handover of government powers over the environment to the states and the territories. The salient matter here is that this legislation is not important, it is not urgent, it is not pressing and it does not have to be pushed through the Senate under this sort of change to the ordinary Senate hours. I would ask all 
 other senators, including those on the government benches, to consider this matter. The urgency is not there.</para><para>It may well be that the Democrats and the government have struck a secret deal on this legislation—and if so, be that on their heads—but I am not going to be party to allowing an extra day's sitting between now and next Wednesday before the next elected Senate comes in to deal with such matters. I have heard no reason from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Prime Minister or anybody else in government as to why we should be sitting extended hours to push through that sort of legislation. It is going to need—and ought to properly have—extensive review by the public before this Senate debates it. It is not going to get that. I will tell you why it is not going to get it, even though this legislation is there as a priority by the government: because the public does not know what the deal is. No-one out there knows what the secret arrangements between the Democrats and the government are. We do have the legislation, as brought into this parliament, before us but we also know that is not what we are going to be dealing with, that there have been extended and lengthy negotiations between the government and the Democrats on this matter.</para><para>Nobody has told me, for example, as a representative of green voters for the Australian Greens, what the details are of this amended document. The government is saying, `Well, we're not going to tell you'—and the Democrats are saying, `We're not going to tell you'—`but we are going to bring this bill in as early as tomorrow and you're going to have to deal with it.' Well, I am not going to be party to that sort of ramrodding and railroading of extremely important legislation through this place, because I hold it in higher regard than that. I hold the national environment in higher regard than that and I hold the importance of being able to inform an electorate before we deal with legislation like that in high regard, so I am not going to support this motion. I am not going to be party to changing the hours to allow that sort of legislative railroading to occur in this place. If there were decency in this process, 
 if an obligation were felt by the government and the Democrats to allow millions of Australians—who will feel, when they get to know about it, that this legislation is important—to understand it, to discuss it and to have feedback on it, we would not be having this process.</para><para>Besides that legislation there is the regional forest agreements legislation which is part of this environmental fix, which gives us an indication of the direction that this is taking. What has happened there is that the national government has signed agreements with several state governments to absolve itself of all responsibility as far as the environment is concerned and to lock into place for 20 years the destruction of forests and wildlife around this country, regardless of what the environment so-called protection bill does. That is what we are dealing with here, but the public out there are not aware of the ramifications of that. What the government is saying to me is that we are going to have to accept its dictates and, no matter how important and fundamental this issue is to our constituents, become part and parcel—by amending the hours—of allowing this legislation to be put through.</para><para>I will not stand for that. I am not going to be party to that. If the Democrats want to be, let them be. If the Democrats, at the end of this tawdry process, are going to be part of guillotining these pieces of legislation to prevent their proper debate, let that be on their heads as well. But I am not going to go along compliantly with a process which has that end result, because these matters are too important. The government ought to recognise that as far as I am concerned, as an Australian Green standing here, these are top priority matters which cannot be dealt with in a cavalier fashion.

This raises serious questions, particularly in view of the suggestions that are being made about proposals to introduce a gag motion. I notice that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has suggested as of 11 o'clock today—that is, 1½ hours before this chamber commenced its deliberations—that the government was considering a gag motion so that its tax legislation would be considered in its time lines. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ian Campbell, said that he would seek the Democrats support to bring an end to the tax debate if time was running out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—I didn't say that at all.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—Senator Campbell indicates that he did not say that.

There is no doubt in my mind that that is what the government 
 intends to do. It intends to use the guillotine to secure the passage of its tax legislation. We ought to understand the context in which these matters are now being proposed—that is, over 100 amendments which we have not seen. We are told that the Democrats themselves have yet to see 15 of these amendments. I can only speculate as to how many they have actually understood. That might be an interesting discussion in itself. But when we are told on the Monday night, the day before this package of bills is supposed to be introduced, that we have a situation where the Democrats themselves have not seen 15 of their own amendments, which go to the heart of this deal that they have entered into, one has to wonder about the appropriateness of asking the Senate to consider these matters in the particular time lines which the government proposes. I say further that two whole new bills are being presented to this parliament and we have yet to see any detail.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I ask senators, when they consider this motion—and I have no doubt that the motion will be carried—to bear in mind the threats that are being made and the positioning that the government is trying to engage in to encourage people who are interested in parliamentary matters to take the view that there has been an undue level of delay in the way in which the Senate is processing the government's legislation. We have a program which is totally unrealistic. We have here various measures being proposed—for instance, legislation on voluntary student unionism. Quite clearly, that is a proposition which is dead in everyone's mind, except the mind of the minister for education. Yet it is listed on this government program as a matter of priority.</para><para>We have here various other measures being proposed for consideration which, clearly, the Senate will not have time to consider in the best of all possible worlds with the best of all possible motives of all senators concerned. So we have to ask ourselves: why is such an ambit claim put before the Senate? It is quite clear that it is because the government is seeking to generate an environment in which it can use the guillotine to undermine the 
 capacity of the Senate to examine its tax legislation in particular. I am especially concerned about the tax legislation and will encourage Senator Bishop to continue in his efforts to study carefully the government's proposals in regard to Telstra and the other packages that are associated with the measures designed to consider a new regulatory regime for telecommunications. One cannot get over the fact that this government is seeking to put in place a situation where it can legitimise the use of a guillotine to prevent proper consideration, scrutiny and public accountability of the measures that it is undertaking.</para><para>With those remarks, I indicate to Senator Ian Campbell that I appreciate his amendments made to the proposal a few moments ago. I am sure that the opposition will continue to consider the government's measures in a most reasonable and thorough manner and I trust that the level of cooperation will extend across the chamber. I have no doubt that the Senate will ultimately see the wisdom of such proposal, even if the government seeks to move its guillotine.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5777</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We had not actually voted on my amendment.

I do think we have a unique situation in 
 Australian politics at the moment where the Australian Democrats, though voting against the declaration of urgency, are able, because they have a full hand in relation to their capacity to deal with the government, to make absolutely clear on the Telstra bill, on the other package of telecommunications bill, on the environment bills and on other legislation that will come before this chamber, that they will not cooperate with the government on a GST guillotine if these other measures are dealt with procedurally in this way. That is absolutely within the gift of the Australian Democrats at this time. I do not want anyone in this chamber or outside to misunderstand the significance of the position that the Australian Democrats find themselves in.</para></talk.start><para>The allegations that have been made by the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate are of course absolutely false. We have had a situation where in terms of public policy in this country the privatisation of Telstra—or from the perspective of the opposition, the retention of Telstra in majority public ownership—is something that must be considered by all of us to be one of the key policy issues for debate in this country. We have a situation now where the government is proposing that the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998  be dealt with for only one hour to conclude debate on that bill in the Senate. That is totally inadequate for such a significant measure.</para><para>It is outrageous, because the telecommunications package—dealing with issues like universal service obligations, dealing with issues like phone sex, dealing with local call zones and the like—deserves far more consideration by this chamber at this time than the government is proposing to provide. It strikes me that we have a situation where the government has determined that, with its arrangements with the Australian Democrats, 
 it can guillotine through—possibly gag but certainly guillotine—the GST package at a time when it cannot provide to non-government senators in the chamber any of the amendments that the government itself proposes to sponsor for the committee stage debate. The amendments are not available to the opposition and they are not available publicly. One assumes that the government has them and one assumes the Australian Democrats have them, but this is all part of a proposal to deal as quickly as possible with the Telstra issue and to move on to the GST package while keeping all non-government senators—apparently with the exception of the Australian Democrats, though they can explain themselves on that issue—in the dark.</para><para>It strikes me that the Senate is entitled to see what the government's proposals are on legislation of this significance, and there has been no effort by the government to provide those amendments. There has been no effort by the government to facilitate debate in relation to the GST package in any way. The opposition has stood ready to debate this legislation sitting-day in and sitting-day out, sitting-week in and sitting-week out. But time and again it has been the government that has sponsored a decision to defer debate on this important legislation.</para><para>It is the government that has taken the Telstra bill off the legislation program for the Senate. It is the government that has chopped and changed countless times not only in relation to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill but also in relation to the GST legislation, which it considers to be the most significant tax reform in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia—so significant that it cannot provide the Senate, the parliament or the public with its proposals even at this late stage, even though it is hell-bent on seeing this legislation dealt with by the Senate before 1 July. We all know why that is the case: there is a change in terms of the Senate numbers on 1 July, and the government wants it to be long gone by 1 July.</para><para>But the Australian Democrats, regardless, can actually stand up to the government on these issues. The Australian Democrats are 
 about to cave on Telstra. The Australian Democrats are about to cave on the environment legislation. You cannot pretend that you are not interested; you cannot pretend that you are going to vote against the guillotine. Just go and say to the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Howard, `We won't support a guillotine on Telstra. We won't support a guillotine on the environment legislation. If you do bring in the guillotine on that legislation, we will not vote for the GST package.' You can do that. You can have the intestinal fortitude to do that. And I hope Senator Brown, who fights over a constituency with the Australian Democrats, makes that point also.</para><para>What we are about to see is a massive sell-out, and not just on the issue of the GST: the Democrats are about to sell out on Telstra. They are going to ensure that the Telstra vote comes on before 1 July. That is what they are about, because they cannot hide on Telstra after 1 July; after 1 July, even on the commitments they made—which are probably not worth the paper they are written on—they will probably have to vote against the bill. They are in a fix with the government to bring it on for a vote now and bring on the environment legislation that you hear so many sleazy comments about from the Democrats—how they are going to go to the ends of the earth to stop this outrageous legislation being agreed to by the parliament. But they are in the swim with the government on it.</para><para>We are dealing now with a motion that means that more of Telstra will be flogged off. That is what it means. And it is being done deliberately, cold-bloodedly, with the connivance of the Australian Democrats, and they ought to be exposed for it. Having said that, let me make it clear that what we have heard from the government on this guillotine motion is absolute hypocrisy. We have heard them, year in and year out, oppose the use of the guillotine because it is `so undemocratic'. We have heard that time and again from people like Senator Hill and Senator Alston. It is nauseating to hear the hypocrisy in the chamber tonight.</para><para>I want to make it clear that the opposition is consistent in relation to the full privatis 
 ation of Telstra. We are going to fight this out to the end.

They move from this side of the chamber and they adopt exactly the same principles. We have a word for that; it is called hypocrisy.

This guillotine means that Senator Alston does not have to answer any of the technical questions he does not know. He will waffle on now; he will absorb all the time. If ever you have seen a pathetic performance, it was Senator Alston on the last Thursday sitting night. He talked out the amendment—we were all ready to vote on it, and he talked it out because he just cannot help himself. He is the reverse of a smorgasbord; he just cannot help himself. He has to get up and show everyone his erudite knowledge on this area, but when he gets exposed, he seeks to guillotine and gag the debate so he will not be exposed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Even though I do not read it in the motion, Senator Alston has indicated that this guillotine, unlike other ones, will allow other party amendments to occur.

 ate. You have this government gone for all money. They are just waiting—begging you.

You just give them anything they want.</para><para>The coalition says to the Democrats, `Jump.' All the Democrats can say is, `How high?' Their attitude seems to be, `Please beat us.' Wake up to yourselves! You do not want Telstra privatised. This government, if it has to choose between the two, is going to choose GST. Use your numbers—use your new influence. And if you do not, go back and explain to your own supporters why you are responsible for the sell out on Telstra.

This resolution went through on the votes of Senator Colston and Senator Harradine. They probably would not have voted for a guillotine one week ago, two weeks ago or three weeks ago. Why not? They were not in the cart. But isn't it amazing? The moment the price is sufficient—the moment they sign up for the bill—they will sign off every other senator's rights to debate it. They will sell them out as quickly as they can. They do not want a debate around their sleazy deal over Telstra. Of course not. So they vote everyone else's rights down the drain. How often have we heard pleas for the rights of Independents? Well, we have rights too. We represent 52 per cent of the preferred vote at the last election so we have some rights too in this chamber. We are not people who got 20,000 or 30,000 votes; we are talking about millions of votes. We are entitled to put that point of view here. We are not entitled to the dominant view; we understand that. But we are entitled to put the view.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have here tonight is a guillotine by ambush which was unnecessary. We should have been given notice of this before the negotiations on the sitting hours. It may 
 well have been that we would have agreed to a reasonable guillotine on these matters because we know inevitably there is going to be a vote on these Telstra matters. There is no way we can put that off; we know that that is coming. We also know that there will be a vote on the tax laws. Why? Because the Labor Party gave its word that these matters will be resolved by 30 June.</para><para>Finally, we know there will be a vote on the appropriation bills because we have no choice but to do that. Therefore, what this guillotine represents is not a judicial murder; it is just a thrill kill by these people opposite, introduced straight after the resolution on the extra sitting hours went through. Okay, it is not going to break my heart, but I tell you what: the next time they come to us for cooperation they will get less and less because we will not be treated in this particular way. If you have a guillotine, tell us about it—we might agree; we might disagree—but it would be a better way of doing business than springing it straight after a resolution where we have given you extra sitting hours.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5783</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition is absolutely right on one matter here and that is that the Democrats have a lot to answer for already.

Tonight, through their failure of ability to negotiate with a government which is consistently outfoxing them, we are facing a precipitate guillotine here which was not forewarned to anybody else in the Senate. I do not know whether the Democrats knew about it, but they are so close to the government these days it certainly did not come across to anybody else if they were told about it. The big item that has been discussed in the electorate is the GST package and the sell-out by the Democrats on their social justice and environmental principles there, not least the latter.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">ALLISON</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—You would not know.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Allison might intervene on that and say that I would not know.

They are selling out their origins and their so-called tenet of honesty and transparency in politics. Moreover, they are selling out the long-held principles of social justice and the environment which come with them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The question I put to the Democrats, if either of them in here have the gumption to get up and follow me, is to explain to this chamber what the process of negotiation with the government is at the moment. I can tell them this: if they are not going to do that tonight they are not going to do it down the next two years. They are becoming part of a collusive club with the Howard-Costello government, and it is not good enough for Senator Allison, or any of the other Democrats, to laugh that off with a nervous giggle. These are important matters. The senator might laugh again but the fact is that these are important matters, not just to Australians as a whole but also to a million people who voted Democrat at the last election and who had a right to expect better. They had no idea that this sort of behaviour from the Democrats was coming down the line. They are thunderstruck by the comprehensive sell-out by the Democrats of their time-honoured policies and they are aghast when one Democrat senator can openly address a forum of business people and say, `We are in the big league now. It is time you gave us some of the donations which go to the other established big league parties.'</para><para>What sort of Democrats is that? Again, Senator Allison laughs. I submit this is not a laughing matter. This is serious stuff. If Senator Allison does not understand it and cannot take it seriously then she should go back and listen to her electorate, which does understand it. The Democrats might have an executive stacked with staff members and senators that can override their membership, 
 but let me say this: politics is not as easy as that; people are not fooled as easily as the Democrat senators might submit. Their membership may be taken as fools by them, but they are not fools, and the retribution will come down the line.</para><para>We have another senator from Queensland here tonight—Senator Andrew Bartlett, who, I am glad to see, is taking notes. I suspect if Senator Allison does not have the gumption to get up, he may be the one. But if any of the Democrat senators think that the next five or six days in this place is going to be the time where they assert a new-found power in politics, let me tell them that they are going to come under very intense scrutiny and criticism on the road to trying to establish that. You do not sell out on your constituency and expect that, in this or any other place, it is going to come as easy as you might think it will.</para><para>As Senator Allison laughs yet again, I say: let her get up and tell her constituency—and tell the media so that they can tell her constituency—what is going on behind closed doors as far as the environmental parameters in both the GST bill and the so-called environment protection bill are concerned. Can Senator Allison tell this chamber that the Democrats have not been negotiating with the government on that legislation? Can the Democrats tell this chamber that they are not negotiating amendments to that legislation with the government as we sit in this chamber tonight? Can the Democrats tell this chamber that that legislation will not be dropped on this chamber tomorrow or the next day or Friday without their constituency or any other constituency having an opportunity to look at it and give them feedback? What is the situation? If I am making these charges with no foundation, let them get up and say so. They are not responding to anybody else; let them respond to this chamber.</para><para>I join the Labor Party in saying to the Democrats that, when you start down this process, you have to know where you are going. You cannot just drift, because if you are drifting—and they are drifting—you leave yourselves, your direction and your ultimate goal in the hands of other more experienced 
 players. If the Democrats want that to happen, want to allow the coalition to be the dictators of their future political fortunes, they are going the right way about it.

One and a half hours before the Senate actually began its deliberations today, the Manager of Government Business had already indicated his view that this Senate was not going to use time appropriately and effectively. What we have established throughout the course of this discussion, both in terms of the previous motion and this one here tonight, is that the propositions that I advanced were completely correct.

What we are being asked to consider tonight is the proposition of 100 per cent privatisation. The proposition to go up only 16 per cent to 49 per cent or any other proposition that has been advanced in the media has yet to be moved in this chamber. There are some 39 other sets of amendments. That goes to probably a couple of hundred amendments in total, I am advised, yet to be considered by this chamber. Yet we are expected to rule off this matter by 11 o'clock tonight.</para><para>We were also told in the previous arrangements about the standing orders in regard to the sitting hours for tonight—that there was to be an adjournment at 10.30.

We were told that these were social bonuses, but they were quite clearly to 
 purchase the votes of certain senators in this chamber. I think we are entitled to ask: what is the nature of those arrangements? We are entitled to consider the implications for the rest of Australia of the special arrangements entered into for one particular region.</para><para>We heard that there are concerns within the Liberal coalition in this country. I heard the Deputy Premier of Western Australia this morning indicating his concern about the implications of this proposal for the good people of Western Australia. I can tell you, in the case of Victoria, similar concerns emerge. I know as a result of the last deal you did there was a disproportionate level of pain and suffering inflicted upon the working people of Victoria, because that is where the job losses were greatest as you transferred resources from Victoria to Tasmania. I think as senators we are entitled to consider the implications of those measures. But that is not being allowed under this proposal. That is not being considered within any matters we see before us tonight.</para><para>We were also told in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning that the Senate will agree to this proposition tonight. We understand how these things get in the papers. It is quite clear that the government were confident that they could secure these arrangements. I am of the view that that was an intrinsic part of the arrangements made with Senator Harradine to get the guillotine in place. That is not what you say, of course, but that is what you do. It is quite apparent from the reports in the paper this morning that the Telstra share sale that the Senate is expected to approve today is a $17 billion end of millennium blockbuster for the government and for the firms conducting the auction. According to the paper this morning, the process is already being shaped by plans for the biggest sale of all—that of the remaining 50 per cent of Telstra.</para><para>I think we have to understand the context in which these arrangements have been made, because this is not just a question that goes to a 16 per cent sale of Telstra; it goes to a whole range of other matters which I think Senator Bishop has drawn to our attention in a very competent manner. What we have actually seen is the impact that such proposals 
 are having on the people of this country. We are entitled to ask: what is the government doing about these measures? We are entitled to consider properly and appropriately the measures that are under consideration in the Senate at the moment. What this motion does is prevent that from occurring. What it does not do is in any way hinder the proposition that there would be a $200 million-plus float feeding frenzy of the various firms seeking to advance their share of the arrangements they wish to secure as a result of the privatisation of another tranche of Telstra.</para><para>We have already considered the total effect of this measure with regard to various people in this country. We have seen the loss of services. We have seen rural and regional Australians severely disadvantaged. We have seen the effect in terms of the public finances arrangement. We have seen the quite devastating impact that it has had in terms of employment. These are important matters that ought to be properly considered.</para><para>These measures do not just go to the privatisation of Telstra, they go to the whole regulatory regime. As I said, there are 39 sets of amendments which have yet to be considered by the Senate. We are expecting that they will be put without debate. We have been told that, under this measure, these will be presented in such a manner that there will not be a proper discussion. There are eight pages on the running sheet of further amendments to be considered. You do not want the scrutiny. You do not want to be held publicly accountable. What you do want is to put this package through in a manner that avoids public discussion of the nature of the deal that you have undertaken with various senators in this chamber to secure their support in the dying stages of this parliament. That is clearly what we are going to do.</para><para>Senator Ray has indicated some of the consequences of these measures as far as the Labor opposition is concerned. Senator Faulkner, in his contribution, indicated the responsibilities of the Democrats in this regard. They do have an opportunity which they cannot walk away from. They have the capacity to say to the government, `These sorts of measures are not appropriate.' We are 
 told that the Democrats are not interested in a guillotine on Telstra. Why don't they use the strength of their bargaining position with regard to the GST to ensure that this guillotine is not moved? We are not going to see that, are we? What we are going to see is the Democrats cravenly caving in, yet again, to the pressures that are being mounted by this government because of a proposition in terms of the GST, the detail of which is being kept from this parliament.</para><para>As I understand it, we are seeing a proposition that is being kept from the Democrats themselves. Fifteen amendments have yet to be seen on the GST package. But we have to race through this Telstra debate. We have to race through consideration of these measures so that we can get onto discussion of the GST. Of course, we have not seen the detail and we have not heard whether or not the Democrats are actually committed to all the fine print, because as far as they are concerned those sorts of matters are not questions that should be properly considered in this context.</para><para>There are two extra bills being proposed in this GST package, yet again we are being told that we have to race forward to examine these matters without proper regard to the due process within this chamber. Senator Ian Campbell indicates that we have spent a fair bit of time on these measures so far. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5789</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been involved in debates on gagging mercifully few times since I came to the Senate in 1993. Native title in 1993 was one of them. There have been, I am glad to say, very few in recent times. Part of the issue with gagging is that, in the past, there was a double whammy due to the fact that there were bills that as a Senate we did not get a chance to see much of at all. Fortunately that was before my time as well. It was as a result of work by my colleague former Senator Christabel Chamarette, who required that the Senate have a chance to look at legislation, that that changed. There was very good reason for that.</para></talk.start><para>Funnily enough, people in the community—our constituents, the people we are supposed 
 to be representing—want to be able to see and comment on the legislation upon which we are being asked to vote. That includes, I believe, the details of major legislative changes that occur as a result of negotiations between parties—governments and whichever parties will allow a certain piece of legislation, which may be highly controversial, to get through the Senate. The general principle of all of this legislation is that, as far as possible, if there are major changes within legislation, we should all have the chance to see what those changes are and what the implications are.</para><para>Senator Campbell has said that the difference between the current government and previous governments is that they are going to allow us to see the amendments before we get the bill. That is going to be really interesting because, if the rumours are correct, we are going to have the environment legislation shoved on us tomorrow and most, if not all, of the environment movement do not have a clue about what is now being proposed in the bill. If Senator Campbell is correct, we will have a chance before we vote—before we go to the second reading—to have a look at what the government are proposing.</para><para>The problem is that in the last eight days of sitting—theoretically seven days—we are being asked to deal with a program which is far too great for the time allocated. Perhaps if all waking hours were to be included—and that is just about what we have at the moment—we would still have a program far too great to be properly considered in the time. Does that mean that we then have a process in the Senate such that whoever agrees to a bill—one would assume the reason people agree is that they think the legislation and the deal they have struck is supportable and able to be defended—has to apparently sign on the dotted line, saying, `By the way, I not only agree to this bill, I agree to it not being debated. I agree that the issues not be brought out, I agree that the questions not be properly asked and I agree with the implications of these amendments and this legislation not being debated.'</para><para>We are well used to this situation when we see it in the House of Representatives. That 
 is what happens when there is a lack of democracy in either chamber of this parliament. I would like to think that at some stage in the future, if and when we get proportional representation in the House of Representatives, that monstrous undemocratic process will cease. However, what we do see, sometimes from both sides of the chamber—the government and the opposition—is that they often think the Senate has far too much say; that is, that the community, via the Senate that is meant to be representing it, has far too much say in the process of debate and review and that they would all like to have a go at weakening the rights of the Senate, to reduce the Senate to simply a rubber stamp for whoever happens to scrape over the line in an election.</para><para>Tonight not only have we had a debate about whether we are going to gag the debate on the bill in relation to the sale of Telstra, but also it has been rightly pointed out that the government have been on again, off again, on again, off again in relation to this bill and others simply because they had not stitched up the numbers at that stage. I had the embarrassment this morning of standing up to deal with the services bill and Telstra and finding out that in fact the government had brought on another bill instead. So there you are, on again, off again this morning. I had to deal with a piece of legislation that the government had not had the courtesy to even let me know was on and on which I had the first amendment. We were particularly pleased about that, but not for the dummy spit right now where the government are saying, `How dare the Senate not behave?' As I say, it was the government that basically brought on and changed the program without telling us this morning.</para><para>Then we had a situation just before the dinner break—it was not recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>—where Senator Campbell was very cross that we should have any debate about the sitting hours. We know now why Senator Campbell was very cross—not just that there was any debate on the sitting hours but that anybody should still be in this chamber after dinner to hear the end of the debate. Why was he cross about that? Because he knew what 
 was coming up. He also knew that the rest of the chamber had not been advised about what was coming up. In the normal way of things there would have been just those people in the chamber to deal with the Telstra sale bill—those people in each of the parties who were dealing with it. Of course, unprepared, there may not have even been this debate because it would have gone through quite quickly—so quickly that we may not have even got our 10 minutes.</para><para>Can I indicate that I was actually standing to speak even as Senator Alston moved his motion on the suspension of standing orders. Everybody was in such a hurry to push this through and to gag debate in the Senate that I was not even recognised in the chamber. Maybe I should have yelled out louder, but basically it was a rush to gag and to stop the rights of the Senate to debate and to find out what is actually in the deals—first of all, the deal in relation to the sale of Telstra. Of course, as we go on this week we all know that the only way to get that big a legislation pile into that time is going to be to squash the democratic process.</para><para>I know Senator Ray said he was quite proud of guillotining 62 bills in the parliament. I would like to have thought that that is not the way the Senate operates now, considering it has other people who can stop that process going on. But no, in the last days before 30 June everyone seems to be wanting to get on the bandwagon to see which bit of the bill they can sell out as quickly as possible with the least possible debate. What do you think the rest of the community in Australia thinks about this process? Think about what it is going to do to the environment, to rural and regional Australia and to our economy and employment. And this is what the government says is the right way to deal with it.</para><para>Like other people who have spoken on this side of the chamber, I am going to vote against this gag. I would like to think that if the process is wrong for this gag the process is also wrong for any potential gags in relation to the GST package or any potential bill in the environmental protection package. I am sorry the Democrats have not yet spoken. 
 Maybe there is still time. I would like to see them answer not just my concerns and not just the concerns of members of this side of the chamber but also the concerns of the constituents in Australia whom we are all meant to represent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5791</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You would not believe it, based on what other people have been saying for the last three-quarters of an hour, but the Democrats are actually going to vote against this guillotine motion.

Of course, that would obviously be difficult to prove.

Unfortunately, the other speakers would not realise that the more they have been going on in relation to this particular guillotine motion, the less time has been available to consider the actual Telstra legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

We would like to see a proper plan in place, a systematic program of upgrading services governed by a well planned strategy to, as closely as possible, reach the equality of services between rural Australia and the cities. 
 Consequently, we do not think that the social bonus program is an ideal program, but again it is a start, which is better than nothing.

To date, something in the order of $671 million has been allocated or promised by the government should the Telstra sale bill go through, that is, if the next tranche—the 16 per cent shareholding—of Telstra should be sold, the government will gross proceeds somewhere in the order of $16 billion to $17 billion. After costs are deducted, the net gain to government will be something in the order of $15 billion to $16 billion.</para></talk.start><para>Out of those net proceeds the government has allocated two tranches, if you like, of social bonus: the $671 million already allocated, $200 million for the Natural Heritage Trust, $70 million over five years for the rural transaction centres, $150 million over three years to allow or improve untimed local call access, $81 million over five years for regional communication needs and $120 million over five years for the television fund. So the first tranche is $671 million of taxpayers' money, to be achieved via the sale of 16 per cent of Telstra and distributed in a rather uneven fashion to certain groups within the community. The opposition takes the view that there is nothing wrong, in principle, with the allocation of those funds to those particular causes, but that allocation should have come out of the normal, routine, day-to-day 
 government operation concerning funds and disbursements. It should have been part of the routine planning processes involved in the telecommunications portfolio. Similarly, the latest tranche of something in the order of $300 million, making a total of $1 billion over the next two to five years, should again be categorised as normal, routine government planning and allocation of funds.</para><para>The social bonus in total is something in the order of almost $200 million a year for five years. When you break it down it is about $10 per week for five years for every Australian. We compare that with the huge amount of fees and costs that is to be paid to a range of interests involved in the privatisation of the next 16 per cent of Telstra. If we look at the facts of this issue—and these were discussed in the Senate hearing in February of this year and referred to in the minority report by opposition senators—bankers and brokers received over $260 million in fees from the sale of the first one-third of Telstra, more than the government allocated to its $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The Auditor-General drew attention to a range of improper practices in the disbursement of those funds, slack accounting records, poor internal controls on disbursement of funds and a range of abuses that occurred in many cities of the world as the roadshow went around selling off Telstra.</para><para>It is fact that, of the $671 million so-called social bonus, only $351 million over five years is to be spent directly on telecommunications infrastructure. The rest is to be used to boost the Natural Heritage Trust and create the rural transaction centres. As a result of negotiations between the government, Senator Harradine and a range of interests over the last three weeks since we last met, an additional $300 million has been allocated in the form of a social bonus. As I indicated earlier, it is remarkable that of that total of almost $1 billion, something in the order of $150 million is going to be allocated to Tasmania.</para><para>Minister Alston indicated earlier, in response to a series of questions, that the government has not gone through any particular planning or processes or commissioned 
 any research in respect of the range of programs it has identified; it simply struck the government as a good idea that the range of programs suggested in negotiations should be implemented. That strikes the opposition as a remarkable way to be running public policy in the allocation of some hundreds of millions of dollars. I think it is fair to categorise the social bonus, particularly the latter part, as a bribe. The way those funds are going to be dispersed raises questions of integrity in public policy.</para><para>We recently had an election in New South Wales where the opposition parties went to the people with a proposition to privatise the entire power network in that state. It was suggested that something in the order of $20 billion would be raised through the privatisation of the New South Wales power system. Serious incentives, if you like, or serious bribes, were offered to the electorate in New South Wales. From memory, something in the order of $1,000 plus was offered to every electricity user in New South Wales if they voted for the actual privatisation of the New South Wales power distribution system. The community poured scorn on that idea.</para><para>Two or three days after the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales announced her position, the opinion polls and newspapers reflected community opinion—that is, that votes were not up for sale, were not up for grabs. The opposition continued on a downward spiral throughout that election campaign and remains in opposition to this day. The proposition that every voter, every electricity user, in New South Wales could somehow or other receive a bonus of $1,000 by voting for the then opposition, voting for the privatisation of the power network in New South Wales, was rejected by the people.</para><para>In terms of some of the programs that are part and parcel of the second tranche, as I said earlier, there is nothing particularly wrong with those programs in isolation. If they were part of on an ongoing plan, an ongoing development of particular states or regions, they would probably have worth on their own. But we find that the allocation of funds simply reflects the perceived needs of 
 the government to privatise the Telstra Corporation.</para><para>One program on its own, worth $15 million—connecting Tasmanian schools to the Internet and providing extra capital to provide computers to school students—is, on its own, not an unworthwhile idea. I am sure every state and territory in Australia that runs a public education system would like to have access to a similar amount of funds to provide computers and software to all of their students. But Tasmania, as we all know, is a state where there is a serious and real population decline. The schools have fewer and fewer children every year. That suggests that there is no demand for an allocation of a huge amount of money for computers in the school system because parents are not having children and children are not attending the schools. When children turn 16, 17, or 18, there is no longer employment and they leave Tasmania to go elsewhere seeking employment.</para><para>It is similar with the mobile phone coverage. The black spots program to extend mobile phone reception on Australia's major highways is in itself a good idea—no-one quarrels with that. But it should be part of normal government planning, normal government processes, to attend to problems that emerge as new technology emerges and fix them up for all road users and for all mobile phone users. But the government allocate $1 million for mobile phone coverage to Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. They allocate that $1 million as part of this program on the basis that those three states did not qualify for the other grants. They did not qualify for the other grants, because the black spots problem did not exist in those states. So to keep those states quiet they are all slung an extra $1 million for each of these programs.</para><para>So the opposition is not particularly opposed to these programs. They may well have merit. They may well bring benefit in terms of the distribution of the social bonus. But we make the point, as I close my remarks, that the social bonus distribution should be spread all around Australia; it should be spread equally to all of the states and it should be 
 allocated to areas of need on a basis that has been identified by proper planning and allocation of resources. The allocation in total of $150 million to Tasmania out of a social bonus distribution of almost $1,000 million is a misallocation of resources. It is a wrong set of priorities and it just repeats the mistake that was made by the current opposition in New South Wales with respect to the privatisation of the power system. It is nothing less than a gentle bribe. It is something the opposition is not comfortable with. We place on record our opposition to it, and we will continue to maintain that position.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>5796</page.no><name role="metadata">Colston, Sen Malcolm</name><name role="display">Senator COLSTON</name><name.id>PF4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the last occasion the Senate considered the sale of Telstra, I had a number of concerns about any further sale of Telstra. In brief, these concerns related to: the corporate culture of labour and customer relations within Telstra; possible deleterious employment effects within rural and regional communities; the provision of telecommunication services to those communities; competition policy; the universal service obligation; and the Commonwealth's proposed use of further sale proceeds.</para></talk.start><para>On that previous occasion, there was insufficient time to negotiate and debate the ramifications of the full sale of Telstra. Indeed, at that time, it could be argued that the government held no mandate relating to those proposals. On this occasion, the government clearly has a mandate to proceed with plans for the full sale of Telstra. It has become apparent, however, that it intends to proceed only with a partial sale, including a further 16.6 percent of the Commonwealth's Telstra asset. Some observers would have noticed that the government fudged its mandate a little. In the election campaign last year, the government said it would first move to increase the public holding of Telstra to 49 per cent. We find that this bill would increase the public holding to 49.9 per cent.</para><para>Since the last occasion on which the sale of Telstra was debated, there has been considerable time to negotiate and debate the government's proposals with many stakeholders. Those parties have included the government, Telstra, the CEPU and Telstra's cus 
 tomers, shareholders, employees and competitors. In the course of those negotiations, it has been established that the concerns I raised previously remain as the core issues relevant to this debate. There is evidence that the proceeds of the sale will provide important benefits to Australia, both in terms of debt reduction and the various projects involved in the enhanced social bonus package, an expansion of which has been announced. Those benefits will be shared by my constituents in Queensland, just as they will be by all Australians.</para><para>In addition, the competition regime associated with this legislation appears to balance the interests of all communications carriers and provide benefits for consumers. Furthermore, there is a commitment on the part of the government to continue serving the interests of consumers through the universal service obligation with the intention to review and enhance the USO on a regular basis.</para><para>The last year has also seen a change in personnel at the highest levels within Telstra. That change has brought a welcome shift in Telstra's corporate approach in a number of areas. For example, I have received assurances from the highest levels within Telstra that the corporation intends to be at the forefront of halting the drift from small rural communities to the capital and regional cities. The indications are that Telstra's approach on this matter includes a commitment to continued provision of new-generation telecommunication products in those regions, in addition to the maintenance and extension of Telstra's existing infrastructure.</para><para>Telstra's rural and remote trainee program—in which young Australians from rural and remote communities are trained to become communications technicians—has been provided as another example of Telstra's commitment to employment and skill infrastructure within those communities. One may cite numerous examples of the remarkable change in corporate culture that have been associated with the personnel change to which I have made reference. Two further examples, however, are worthy of note.</para><para>The casualties of Telstra issue has been, to some degree, a watershed in terms of custom 
 er relations. Telstra's recent approach to the settlement of the CoT cases is most welcome. So, too, is Telstra's commitment to pursue a multifaceted approach to restructuring. While recognising that change in the telecommunications industry is inevitable, it is clear that better approaches than those used previously are available. Telstra's recent adoption of a culture of consultation and proactive involvement of staff affected by possible changes are beneficial for both the staff and Telstra's financial performance. Further, when restructuring is necessary, Telstra's commitment to offering redeployment, redundancy, or reskilling, retraining and job placement is a productive and welcome approach to labour relations.</para><para>Once more, I acknowledge the assistance of the minister, his staff, Telstra officials, the CEPU, Telstra's competitors, shareholders and customers, as well as my own staff, in assisting with my deliberations on this matter. Those deliberations, on balance, indicate that an important and beneficial revision of Telstra's customer and labour relations has occurred and that a further partial sale of Telstra will have lasting benefits for all Australians. Thus I will be supporting the sale proposed by the government, which still leaves the government as a majority shareholder in Telstra.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>5797</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I certainly welcome the commitment given by Senator Colston to the sale of the remaining 16.6 per cent of the shareholding.

Queensland has the most digital radio concentrators, and the users who stand to benefit from them will get a $150 million network upgrade. We also have many local governments in regional areas. New initiatives that bring the total funding up to $1 billion include $158 million for the Building Information Technology Strengths program; $70 million for the Building Additional Rural Networks, or BARN, program; $45 million to help local governments to get online; an extra $3 million on top of the already announced $25 million to expand mobile phone coverage; and $3 million to fund a network to promote safe Internet content.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have already announced $686 million, $150 million for untimed local calls and a new preferential call rate of 25c for 12 minutes. Together with the $160 rebate, that gives rural Australians the equivalent of 2.4 hours of local calls per week if their service centre is outside their zone. That is a huge initiative for rural Australia. $36 million will go to installing points of presence in each zone so that all Australians will be able to have access for local calls. Time and time again we have heard, at various points when we have gone around rural Australia, that what is required to ring their neighbour—or sometimes, on their own property, to ring down to the cottage—results in a timed called.</para><para>There is $70 million for Rural Transaction Centres to restore services to the bush, like Medicare, banking, post, fax and phone. A $120 million TV fund extends SBS to another one million Australians for the first time and eliminates TV reception black spots for others. Of this, $10 million goes to small self-help towns to subsidise the cost of equipment necessary to receive the second commercial broadcaster. The government has also boosted 
 the universal service obligation to ensure that 64 kilobytes of data downlink speeds will be available on demand to all Australians. Regional Australia also benefit significantly from the $250 million boost to the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>The package for the bush is historic in size and it follows intensive negotiations by National Party senators with the minister, Senator Alston, and also the Prime Minister. The final package delivers much more than the Queensland National Party asked for in its Bundaberg resolution as a prerequisite to supporting the full sale of Telstra.</para><para>I was going to move amendment ER249, which reduces the government's holding in Telstra by 16 per cent down to 50.1 per cent. If that is not in front of the chair at the moment, I will say that if it gets to be the question before the chair, then I will take the advantage of moving it. At the moment it is doubtful whether we will get to it because of the guillotine, but I want to signal that it is my intention to move that amendment when it comes before the chair.

I listened closely to Senator Boswell's comments. As he was making them and outlining the perceived benefits, from his perspective, that would flow to rural Australia and the state of Queensland, I was looking through the media release put out by Senator Alston late yesterday afternoon where he outlined in detail the $314 million involved in the second tranche social bonus. As I listened to Senator Boswell and looked at Senator Alston's press release, there was no correlation at all between the two.</para></talk.start><para>Going through each element of the package one by one, I draw to rural Australia and Senator Boswell's constituency the facts of 
 the matter. They are these: the Building IT Strengths—the BITS—program is going to be allocated $158 million, and $40 million of that will be allocated to Tasmania for development of the intelligent island. That leaves $118 million for distribution in the remainder of Australia. Senator Alston, prior to dinner, was kind enough to tell the chamber that that $118 million outstanding from the BITS program is not going to be allocated on a proportionate basis to each or any of the states but will be broken up into three internal programs and that applications will be solicited and it is anticipated that the bulk of that $158 million will go to the two states, Victoria and New South Wales, that already have active ongoing and developed IT industries and multimedia programs. So that is $158 million out of the $314 million that will not be going to rural and regional Australia and will not be going to Queensland.</para><para>In terms of the Building Additional Rural Networks program, the BARN program, $70 million has been allocated. But, again, those funds are going to be distributed proportionately—each of the states will get $10 million. So indeed Senator Boswell is correct in respect of that program—Queensland will get $10 million, but so will each of the others states. For Networking the Nation—the local government fund—$45 million has been allocated but, again, as with the BARN program, it is going to be allocated proportionately to each of the states, and Queensland will get $6 million only—the same as each other state.</para><para>The expanded mobile phone coverage program—$3 million goes solely to Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. The NetWatch program—$3 million is simply going to be allocated to the state of Tasmania. The Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Services—the TIGERS program—$10 million will be allocated, again only to Tasmania. Additional environment spending of $9.4 million will be allocated only to Tasmania. Connecting Tasmanian schools, which I referred to earlier—$15 million will be allocated, only to Tasmania. Other infrastructure initiatives—$800,000 will 
 be allocated, only to rebuilding an athletics track in Tasmania.</para><para>This new tranche will have application around Australia, but Queensland's share—rural and regional Australia's share—is the same for New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and any other states and territories: $10 million and $16 million respectively. So congratulations are in order to some senators in this chamber because they have achieved a great and bounteous result for their particular states. Tasmania will receive $150 million out of the total of $1 billion. Fifteen per cent of the social bonus will be spent in Tasmania, but in Queensland there will be additional funds provided of only $10 million for the BARN program and $6 million for Networking the Nation.</para><para>If Senator Alston's media release is correct—and I have no reason to doubt its veracity—and his earlier comments prior to dinner are correct, there has been little, if any, gain for rural and regional Australia outside of the $671 million that was allocated as the social bonus in the first tranche.

The potential of projects to promote development, competition or diversity in the telecommunications (and related services) industries or the acceptance of innovative communications solutions may also be considered.</para><para>Minister, I draw your attention to those criteria because I want to ask you quite specifically if Telstra is at all involved in the process of the selection criteria with respect 
 to RTIF projects. If so, what is the extent and nature of that involvement?</para><para>The reason I ask this question is that several of the projects, if your rhetoric is to be believed, have the potential—again I can quote from the very same document—to maximise competition, to ensure a level playing field. If what you are saying is in fact correct—and I actually doubt the sincerity of the government in this matter, for reasons that have been put on the public record for quite some time—perhaps you can explain the nature and role of Telstra's involvement in the selection criteria and whether or not they at any point have the opportunity to peruse funding applications.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>5801</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The short answer is that the decision making processes of the board are matters for the board, not for Telstra or for the government. It is at arm's length. It does, however, consult with a number of interested parties, including state governments and probably carriers, to explore options, just as it consults very carefully with applicants and advises them on the likelihood of their particular project being supported, even suggesting ways in which it might be better presented. So it does engage in extensive consultation, but at the end of the day it makes the decisions on its own. It certainly does not have Telstra participating in the decision making processes.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>5801</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just to follow up on that, Minister, can you get some advice from the board and ask them specifically if Telstra have been asked to directly comment on or peruse applications through the RTIF? The issue is this: right through this debate Labor has said that there is an appropriate place for Telstra in our community in supporting telecommunications and information infrastructure. The government has chosen to attach to the process of the partial or full sale of Telstra the creation of infrastructure of this type through the RTIF. It is contingent on the sale. To make that RTIF funding available contingent on the sale relates back to the ability of these communities to actually 
 enhance their opportunity to participate in the information society. It is the types of projects that this government is seeking to fund through this contingency of the sale of Telstra that presupposes the introduction of further RTIF funding.</para></talk.start><para>If indeed Telstra have any role at all in assessing or vetting RTIF applications in the context of the guidelines I described, is that fair? Surely the RTIF is there to actually break down some of the cost inhibitors that confront rural and regional users of telecommunications particularly and information services like the Internet. Surely that is what it is there for. This is a very important question for the minister to answer and for the RTIF board to answer, because if Telstra do have a say then this whole process and the government's rhetoric about the RTIF actually constituting a social bonus, implying that it will enhance the opportunities for rural and regional Internet telecommunications customers to actually be able to get online and to participate more, are an absolute farce.</para><para>It has been completely analysed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by other studies and by the government's own work demonstrating what the barriers to online participation are in rural and regional Australia. They relate primarily to cost and secondarily to the quality of the services. Both of these issues are almost completely dominated with respect to the services Telstra provide in rural and regional areas. Many of the RTIF grant applications that have come forward from those communities seek to redress the shortfalls of these services in rural and regional areas by virtue of cost and by virtue of quality of service, being applications seeking to implement new technology and to build new infrastructure. Yet here we find in the selection criteria some sort of test that a project cannot mess up any existing services; it cannot play with the entrenched monopolies that are out there putting rural and regional families at what we know is a distinct socioeconomic disadvantage. It costs too much for so many of them to get online.</para><para>Surely, Minister, you can provide a decent and in-depth explanation, because we have not received answers to those questions on 
 notice from additional supplementary estimates. We have not seen those answers. I think you owe to this chamber, if not to rural and regional Internet users or indeed those who are hopeful to have that service affordable and available in the future, an explanation as to what exactly is going on in the decision making process of RTIF funding. If indeed we find that the RTIF funding system is able to be manipulated by the very corporation that you stand up and say you are trying to address in the social bonus, that you are trying to facilitate a competitive environment et cetera, you will be exposed not only as being completely hypocritical but also as grossly misleading the Senate and grossly misleading the Australian public. I look forward to your answers, Minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>5802</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The short answer is that the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund has been a screaming success.

We discussed this last time we met, some two or three weeks ago. The opposition has withdrawn its original amendment and substituted it with amendments Nos 1 to 18. When the Senate last met, I indicated the commitment that Labor has to the amendments we have said we will move with regard to this legislation. In the last few weeks we have received extensive representation from telecommunications service providers and their representative bodies. They have given a great deal of attention to the potential for collateral damage to these industries that might arise from the government's proposals. Today the opposition has circulated further amendments to this bill that we feel both reinforce the position taken by the Labor Party during the previous debate and extend greater certainty to the telecommunications service providers in this country who feel that the government proposal will cause inadvertent damage to their businesses.</para><para>Modelling by the industry has indicated that, at best, the entire 1900 telephone service industry may suffer from a decline in revenue of up to $75 million, which represents approximately $13.5 million in lost taxation revenue for the government, and, at worst, the revenue will tumble by $150 million, which would mean taxation revenue cuts of approximately $22.2 million. The damage that these revenue declines may cause to the rest of the 1900 industry could be catastrophic. Many agencies and organisations use 1900 services to inform the public and operate their businesses. These include major media outlets, state 
 and local government agencies and a range of small businesses and information providers. The opposition amendments to this bill will provide common ground between the objectives of preventing the misuse of these services by minors and unauthorised users and minimise damage to industry and loss of revenue and employment opportunities arising from such damage.</para><para>Firstly, we reiterate our belief that industry must be given 12 months to prepare for any changes to the access regime for these services in order to allow both carriers and information service providers an opportunity to implement appropriate access mechanisms and to fully inform staff and customers about these changes. The minister has tried to have us believe that Telstra has a different view on the time it will take to implement such changes, stating that it had said it could be done in six months. In fact, Telstra has not moved from its position that it will take it at least 12 months to develop appropriate access mechanisms.</para><para>Secondly, we seek to move further amendments which will serve to allow a certain portability of identity authentication in this industry. We will move to allow calls to these services to be made under specific access mechanisms agreed to by the telecommunications service industry and the Australian Communications Authority. For example, the ACA may approve a system where calls to these services may be made from any phone by customers using a unique personal identification number and a phonecard linked to a 1800 based identity verification system.</para><para>In conclusion, when we put forward the amendments on the last occasion we indicated that we wanted our amendments to be considered seriously. We circulated further amendments this morning. We have spoken to the background already and will explain it in more detail in a few moments. We indicate to the chamber that the imposition of the guillotine changes the whole situation and the opposition is reviewing its position on the issue of phone sex.</para><para>Just fleshing out the amendments Nos 1 to 18 which have been circulated, we have identified three major deficiencies in the 
 government proposal. The opt-in arrangements are inflexible and may unfairly impact on unrelated parts of the telephone information service industry. The opt-in can be undertaken only in writing and does not reflect current technology and accepted practices in terms of identification and services available by telephone, facsimile and email. Also, six months is an insufficient period of time for the carriers to implement the required PIN infrastructure.</para><para>The Labor amendments will: extend the period of time before the introduction of the measures in the bill from six months to 12 months to allow carriers and industry to develop authentication mechanisms and to inform the customers of adult telephone services of the change from the 1900 prefix to the 1901 prefix; broaden the method by which customers can opt in to these services by including applications made in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means; provide for a mechanism which allows secure authentication that is portable, which customers can use to access adult telephone information services from any telephone service by use of a unique phonecard and PIN system—this system will be known as an approved authentication means and must be approved by the Australian Communications Authority by way of a disallowable instrument; and, finally, require the Australian Communications Authority to consult with carriers, telephone service providers and information service providers with regard to the technical detail of such an approved authentication means.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5811</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens (WA) will not be supporting these amendments.

 Devonport, Tasmania, on 9 June. Aubrey Luck was an outstanding citizen of north-west Tasmania whose long life—indeed, he was 98 when he died—contributed greatly to the wellbeing of his fellow Tasmanians. I was indeed honoured to represent the Prime Minister at the funeral and commemoration for the creative life of the late Aubrey Luck.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Luck was a member of the House of Representatives from 1951 to 1958, representing the north-west Tasmanian seat of Darwin, and he was the member when the electorate changed its name to Braddon in 1955 during the process of redistribution. Aubrey Luck was elected as the Liberal member for Darwin following an eight-year term of that great lady, Dame Enid Lyons, the wife of the only Prime Minister to come from Tasmania. He also inherited the tradition of another famous MHR for Darwin, King O'Malley, who held the seat for 14 years between 1903 and 1917.</para><para>In 1955 it was the late Aubrey Luck who suggested to parliament that the name of the electorate should be changed from Darwin to Braddon to avoid confusion raised by the earlier name. During this time, the local MP, Aubrey Luck, was very active in a number of issues which were of particular importance to his north-west Tasmanian seat. One of the most important of these was the improvement to the Bass Strait shipping service by introduction of the first Bass Strait vehicular ferry, the <inline font-style="italic">Princess of Tasmania</inline>. Although a vastly smaller vessel than the current ferry, the <inline font-style="italic">Princess of Tasmania</inline> allowed visitors from the mainland to more readily visit Tasmania, accompanied by their cars. This saw the beginning of a steady growth of Tasmania's tourism industry, an industry which has grown into one of the state's main economic contributors.</para><para>The late Aubrey Luck was also to the fore in having the new ferry based at his home town of Devonport, beginning the long history of Devonport benefiting from its links with tourism and shipping. Aubrey Luck was also one of the first pioneers to create tree plantations to provide for the future needs of the building industry, another industry which is now to the fore in Tasmania's economy. He was also the prime mover in having the then 
 Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, visit the west coast mining town of Queenstown in the mid-1950s. The Copper Bounty Act was passed, which saved the Queenstown mine. During his period as an MP, Aubrey Luck conscientiously travelled around the electorate in his Chevrolet, which clocked up more than a quarter of a million miles in the days before sealed roads and travel allowances. His term in office also saw him put in much hard work to develop the Devonport airport and to promote the establishment of the Tootals textile factory, which provided many jobs for the people of Devonport.</para><para>Aubrey Luck was born in Launceston in 1900 and was an intelligent and enterprising lad as he progressed through his schooling, which was highlighted not only by his good academic achievement but also by his sporting prowess. He was a member of the strong Launceston High School rowing crew, which dominated schoolboy rowing during the years of the First World War.</para><para>Fortunately for Aubrey Luck, the war ended just before his 18th birthday, and he was not required to join his brothers in France, one of whom was killed. He had already showed early entrepreneurial skill when, as a mere 14-year-old, he grew vegetables in his family backyard and sold them to neighbours. After the war ended, he suffered from a lack of work at a time when returned soldiers were given preference.</para><para>Aubrey was sent to Devonport to work with his uncle, who was reopening a flour roller mill in the town. In 1924 he married, and was to have six children, two of the boys sadly dying in infancy. Following a fire in the roller mill and the subsequent rebuilding, Aubrey Luck had his first experience with the building trade. This work developed into Mr Luck's main lifelong business interest of provision of building supplies and involvement in the construction industry.</para><para>Although a successful businessman and strong family man, Aubrey Luck also found the time to pursue a wide range of sporting and community interests. He played football, rowed with the Mersey Club and became involved with the Devonport Racing Club. He was a foundation member of the Devonport 
 Athletics Club and was a volunteer fire brigade member for 21 years. In a fitting tribute, the Mersey Rowing Club formed a guard of honour, complete with oars, as the cortege moved slowly away from St John's Anglican Church in Devonport.</para><para>The late Aubrey Luck also contributed much to the community of Devonport—to the show society, the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and Parents and Friends. He held high office in the Masonic Order and was President of the local Master Builders Association. Aubrey Luck also served on the Devonport Council and was deputy warden for two years.</para><para>However, it was through his business that most people will remember Mr Luck. He spent his entire working life building up his business which provided employment for many people in north-west Tasmania. The present Luck and Haines company remains one of the north-west coast's icon businesses. In later years Aubrey Luck retired to enjoy the pleasures of seeing his grandchildren and his great grandchildren growing up around him.</para><para>Aubrey Luck lived a long and productive life. Those who knew him well will mourn his passing, and those of us who can now look back on his amazing contribution to this nation and his community can only give thanks for the life of an amazing man. To his surviving children, Barbara Payne, June Ingles and Mary Jarman, and his many grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other family members, I pass on my condolences. We must be grateful for such a good life.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Export Meat Inspection</title><page.no>5828</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>5828</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 9 June I placed on notice questions relating to the operations of a number of meatworks. Some of those questions refer to the operation of export establishment No. 517—the export works operated by Rockdale Meats Pty Ltd at Yanco near Leeton in New South Wales. In particular, I was seeking details on the implementation of the new meat inspection system, the Australian Meat Safety Enhancement Program, at that plant. The US authorities have finally agreed to the applica 
 tion of this system, but it is a system that is a mere shadow of its former self. In its original form, the inspection plan—then called Project 2—amounted to industry self-regulation gone mad.</para></talk.start><para>Senators will also recall the shambles this process became in the hands of the former primary industries minister, Mr Anderson. Mr Anderson, following a meeting with the US Secretary of Agriculture and members of the US House Agriculture Committee in July 1997, claimed that the United States authorities had accepted the new inspection arrangements in principle. Of course, this was not the case, and was strenuously denied by the United States. That false claim caused both Mr Anderson and the Howard government much embarrassment, and so it should have.</para><para>While I am yet to get answers to those questions, I rise tonight to speak on this matter because of an article that appeared on page 5 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper. The article was about the government's new inspection system and its implementation at Rockdale. It referred to an adverse report from a recent AQIS inspection of the Rockdale plant. The AQIS inspectors who undertook the audit were accompanied by officials from the United States Food and Drug Administration.</para><para>US inspectors have been regular visitors to Australian export meatworks. It is part of the deal with the United States: if we want to export meat to that massive market, we have to subject our plants to inspection by their officials from time to time. However, the usual process has been that AQIS inspectors make sure our house is in order before these visits take place. Better we find and fix problems in our export plants than have those problems pointed out by US inspection teams. This has generally been an effective discipline on the export plants and also the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported that, while the meat handling procedures at Rockdale plant passed scrutiny, the plant received only a marginal rating because of the problems with air control and condensation. I noted the reported comments by the Rockdale Managing Director, Paul Toja. He said the problem was one 
 of construction, not related to the new inspection arrangements. He said he was surprised at the marginal rating AQIS gave the plant because of the technical nature of the problem. Mr Toja said the Rockdale plant was a national leader.</para><para>The problems found by the AQIS inspectors, in the company of US officials, appeared to me to be more than just technical. The AQIS report on that plant inspection states under the subheading `Audit findings':</para><para>Marginal audit outcome principally caused by the failure to prevent and adequately control condensation in a number of places such as exit from the carcase decontamination unit, offal room, offal chiller and several carcase chillers.</para><para>The report continues:</para><para>This is regarded as a system failure which the company urgently needs to address in order to achieve long term effective prevention of the problem.</para><para>In fact, the weighted score for the activity `chilling/freezing/storage', which is classified as a critical activity, was zero. The company has been given until 16 July to fix the problem. As I said, this does not seem to be a simple technical problem.</para><para>The development of the meat inspection enhancement system has tested the tolerance levels of US and European authorities. I note that the European Union has not yet approved the system, and Brian McDonald, the relevant senior AQIS officer, is off to Europe to pressure the government's case next week. As I said, the original Project 2 plan—as it was known—had to be significantly watered down to gain US endorsement. It may have to be further refined if it is to attract EU support. If Rockdale is the model export plant through which these new arrangements are to be tested, then it must be exactly that: a model plant in every sense. But the recent AQIS inspection confirms that this is currently not the case.</para><para>The marginal audit report appears not to be the only problem at Rockdale meatworks. It has been alleged that the management at the plant has made a number of threats against AQIS inspectors in response to the condemnation of product. I understand that there has recently been rejection of product by AQIS 
 officers. In particular, a significant number of heads have been rejected due to their unhygienic presentation. I further understand a senior AQIS officer has warned his superiors that any claim that Rockdale management is intimidating AQIS inspectors who fail to deliver, in the company's view, satisfactory rates of offal recover might be sustainable. This second problem at the Rockdale plant adds to my concern about these new inspection arrangements and the government's application of them.</para><para>These two issues at Rockdale highlight the fine line the government is trying to tread in relation to export meat inspection procedures. Firstly, the system of audit of export works by AQIS is not operating correctly if it undertakes an inspection of a plant, with USA officials, that has major deficiencies. One would hope that our plant audit system would ensure that when AQIS visits occur everything is in order, and certainly everything is well and truly in order prior to any inspection by US Food and Drug Administration officials. The adverse Rockdale report suggests that that process has broken down at least on this occasion. I intend to pursue this point further to see how widespread this problem of adverse audit findings is.</para><para>Secondly, the shift of inspection functions from AQIS to the companies themselves might also prove to be a false economy if inspection regimes break down because of economic pressures. If reduced numbers of on-site AQIS inspectors create a climate of isolation and intimidation by plant managers in pursuit of economic throughput at the expense of adequate hygiene standards, the entire industry will be the loser. If substandard product then finds its way into the US market as a result, the whole industry will pay, not just the plant responsible. International market pressures will see to that.</para><para>I understand that the approval of the Meat Safety Enhancement Program for Rockdale is considered by the USA to be on a trial basis only. This contradicts government claims that these arrangements have been locked in with the United States. The reality is that Australia's meat export sector always operates on a trial basis, and we cannot afford to make 
 any mistakes. If we want to secure and grow our meat exports, to the USA and the EU in particular, we cannot afford to have adverse audits on key export plants such as Rockdale. We certainly cannot afford a meat inspection program driven by economic imperatives over the maintenance of proper standards. And there is certainly no place for a shift to 100 per cent self-regulation for the industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kosovo Safe Haven Program</title><page.no>5830</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>5830</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about the situation in the Kosovo Safe Haven Program in Australia. Particularly this week we have seen on the news the terrible situation these people have fled from. As NATO forces go in, it is safe for reporters to go back in, and they film the carnage and destruction that the Yugoslav forces have wrought upon Kosovo. The heart of the Australian people has gone out to the Kosovo refugees who have come into this country and into a number of safe havens. I think Australia is to be commended on its effort in this area. We are now undertaking a program of 4,000 refugee settlements during the time in which they have to stay away from Kosovo. Per capita, that is five times the effort of the United States.</para></talk.start><para>There has been an excellent combination of pulling together by various groups in the community, government, the Department of Defence, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and community groups and individuals who have given so generously to this program. I am the patron for the safe haven at Singleton, and the effort of the people in the Hunter Valley has been overwhelming in supporting the people in this safe haven. On an individual perspective, people like Betty Thompson, President of the Singleton Quilters Guild, and her team, and the CWA Association of Singleton, Branxton-Greta, Lower Belford and Jerrys Plains, led by Betty Irons, provided for the Singleton safe haven things like quilts, bikes, oil heaters, kids' slippery slides and trauma teddies, to make the comfort of those people as good as they possibly can. The government is spending resources at Singleton to rapidly upgrade the facilities. Heating has gone into what were basic army barracks, partitions are 
 going in and carpets are going in, and the whole place is being made quite comfortable.</para><para>The vast majority of refugees who are at the Singleton safe haven are incredibly grateful to the Australian people for the efforts that they have put into this program. Therefore it is unfortunate that there was an incident last week which initially involved 80 people but quickly came down to one family. The sad thing about the incident, I suppose, is that it has tended to have an effect on the attitude of the Australian people towards this program. But they should not judge the overall gratitude of the people who have come out from Kosovo by the actions of a few.</para><para>It started with six men on the bus trip from Sydney. They did stop off for lunch and they hatched this plan that the 80 would stay on the bus. We should understand that they are coming from a very patriarchal society, and what these six leading men said actually went and people did follow what they said. So we had a sit-in on the bus. But by the start of the second night, families, as they needed to leave the buses to go to the facilities in the camp, just did not come back. As the night went on, they all slowly melted away, got the keys and went to their rooms, except one family. This was the Salihu family, led by Sabit, the son. He stayed on the bus for yet another night.</para><para>The matter was resolved when the police read the doctor's report on his aged mother, which showed that she had suspected pneumonia in the left lung. On that basis, the police then drove the bus to Singleton District Hospital and the mother was examined by doctors. She was found not to have pneumonia but to have a number of conditions which in normal circumstances would mean that they would be treated from home. I really take my hat off to Singleton District Hospital for the generosity of their treatment of this family. They were prepared to admit the mother for treatment. They were prepared to put up the entire family in a private facility they had. They were prepared to give them an area that had a room leading off onto a verandah, en suite facilities and a kitchen—far better than anyone else had in the entire 
 program. This was the generosity of Singleton District Hospital.</para><para>After several hours of negotiation when this agreement was made at the hospital, I took Sabit to this facility and said to him, `Well, this is just what you wanted for your mother.' He said through an interpreter, `No, no—not it; don't want that.' He was absolutely determined to get back to East Hills initially, where he came in, and then eventually back to Europe.</para><para>What people must understand is that people in this program are here on open visas for three months. Just like tourists, they can move around. We have no power of restraint. When they wanted to leave the hospital, we had no power to restrain them from doing that, even though this might not have been wise in terms of the health of the mother. He did leave the hospital and went to the railway station, where he waited for a train. It was reported by the people who took the cab fare and the station fare that he had plenty of money with him. He bought his ticket and was on the station ready to go. Of course there was an enormous amount of press around at this point. Then, to our absolute amazement, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper turned up with a large taxi, a kombivan type taxi, loaded the family on board and took them to Sydney.</para><para>I have made some comment about the actions of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which I would like to put on the record here tonight because I feel that they acted unethically and that they crossed a very vital line. The role of newspapers and journalists is to report the news, to comment upon the news and to interpret the news, not to make the news. That is precisely what the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> did by that action. We have currently a Senate inquiry into codes of practice in the information industry. The Press Council is one of the things that we are examining. It is something that I am going to refer to the committee because I believe that the powers of the Press Council are probably inadequate to deal with those sorts of actions.</para><para>The family went back to East Hills. They are waiting there and we now have the clearances internationally for them to return to Europe. That will happen in the very near future. The minister, Philip Ruddock, came up 
 on Sunday and looked through the facilities. He spent several hours there. I went through with him. We went through several rooms and through the dining rooms, and we spoke to quite a number of the people. As we were walking around the camp I came across three of the six from the team they had on the bus who were leading negotiations on their behalf. I asked them yesterday, through an interpreter, how things were going. They were quite happy. When they had come into the camp and had been on the bus, they were right up one end of the camp and they had not really seen the camp. They had not experienced the facilities. After several days they were quite happy with their arrangements. We have now resolved that major incident that I mentioned.</para><para>I put this on the record tonight because I really do not want the Australian people to judge the program, which involves 4,000 people, by the actions of one man who may have soured the taste of some of the very generous people in Australia who have given great time, effort and resources to support people who have come from a terribly traumatic situation and conditions which we can only imagine. We have had, from the Australian people, enormous generosity. Tonight I would like to pay special tribute to that generosity.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Serbian Community in Australia</title><page.no>5832</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>5832</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Until the end of the 18th century, the Aboriginals were the only people in possession of our continent.

For this to be of the highest, our society must deal with each of us as entire members of it, as fully entitled to our place in it as are any of our fellow citizens and as in no way diminished because of our origins.

But allegations and innuendos can reach the point where they prejudice a fair and gracious society.

They have done so responsibly, and that fact ought to be publicly acknowledged. People can protest about what is happening to the country from which they or their forebears have sailed or flown in the past without in any way prejudicing their identity as Australians.

I rise to speak about that institution which, since its inception in 1897, has been at the forefront of the creation of Queensland's wealth and prosperity, has been the foundation of Queensland's agricultural industry and the source of agricultural education for many Queenslanders, other Australians and overseas agricultural graduates and that still has the same important role to play into the next century.</para></talk.start><para>This vital institution—now the Gatton College Campus of the University of Queensland—was amalgamated with the University 
 of Queensland in 1991 and as a consequence finds itself without a certain future. There have been seven University of Queensland reviews since the amalgamation and reallocation of the Faculty of Natural Resources, Agriculture and Veterinary Science to the Gatton Campus. They have all made favourable recommendations for the consolidation of the agriculture faculty at the Gatton Campus. Despite this and promises of new research facilities and yearly infrastructure investment, in recent years Gatton has been losing facilities, students and funding.</para><para>The time has come for action, not reviews. The University of Queensland, as the governing body of the Gatton Campus, must after eight years give Gatton a firm financial assurance that it has a guaranteed future as a leading agricultural training and learning facility. Gatton College has provided training from paddock to plate, but since amalgamation in 1991 has gone from a peak of 3,300 students down to a projected 2,150 students by the year 2000. A decision in 1997 that relocated part of the Department of Business Economics and Law and the Hospitality School from Gatton to the new Ipswich Campus and to South Bank TAFE has taken away 800 students and 20 teaching and support staff.</para><para>The establishment of the Ipswich Campus of the University of Queensland has had its effect on Gatton Campus. In 1996 there was an increased allocation of 425 undergraduate places, a further 340 in 1997 and 185 in 1998 to Queensland university. None of these went to Gatton—750 went to Ipswich, of which only 470 are presently being used. At the same time 800 went from Gatton with a further 689 to go next year. This is a huge loss for a campus and for a rural community, and is occurring in a situation where Ipswich could not take up its allocation. We were told at the estimates hearings last week that this reflected student demand—but it seems hard on Gatton when they are not given the infrastructure development or the courses to keep up their numbers.</para><para>An agricultural college in the lush agricultural area of the Lockyer Valley has been a major component of the Gatton region since 
 1897. Its magnificent surrounds provide a perfect setting for the teaching of agriculture. Gatton College generates 1,900 jobs and is the largest single employer in the region, providing a turnover in the region of $22 million a year. There has been a loss of farming facilities on campus and an economic loss to all the supporting businesses that have developed to serve the college in the area. A university in a regional centre is a great boost to an area and the Gatton region and the agricultural college have had a mutually supporting partnership over the past 102 years.</para><para>Leaving the Gatton Campus hanging, as Queensland University has over eight years of review, also affects the eight current industry research projects at Gatton College totalling $6.55 million with two other projects under consideration. This includes a $1.9 million wild flower genetic development project supported financially by the three local councils through the Australian waste water project to encourage Australian farmers to enter the $22 billion global cut wild flower industry. For further success the college must continue to have investment in essential infrastructure and to know it has a clear and unambiguous future. Queensland needs a premier agricultural tertiary institution. Agricultural research and education are still vitally needed in a predominantly resource led state like Queensland.</para><para>At a Senate estimates hearing last week the federal department could not give any assurances about Gatton. They told me at the estimates hearing that:</para><para>. . . broadly, in our preliminary discussions with the University of Queensland, they have indicated an intention that there will be some long term activity at Gatton. They have not decided the exact shape of that.</para><para>The University of Queensland has an annual budget of around $500 million a year. A vast proportion of this comes from federal funding. Out of this half a billion dollars, Gatton College needs around $10 million to upgrade its facilities and run an integrated agricultural faculty at its campus. In today's <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> , John Hay, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland, said:</para><para>My view is that the fundamental difference between Queensland in the past and Queensland in the future will be a shift from resources and tourist based activities to knowledge based activities.</para><para>He went on to say:</para><para>Traditional industries such as mining and agriculture will employ few people in the years ahead—and they will have a far greater dependence on adding value which thrived from knowledge based personnel.</para><para>Current statistics show increased employment growth in agriculture, and I am sure any agriculturalists can tell the Vice-Chancellor that for value adding we need clever and smart farmers and continued and cutting edge research into agriculture, contributions which have always been made by Gatton College.</para><para>Universities in recent years have been given significant autonomy over their actions. University educational profiles are the Commonwealth government's major mechanism for accountability. There is also a large taxpayer contribution to the universities, yet according to the department at the Senate estimates last week there are no allocations for any specific funds to the Gatton Campus in their long-term strategic plan for implementing the university's own recommendation to relocate a substantial agricultural faculty at Gatton.</para><para>Queensland agriculture will not accept this sort of downgrading of input into research and training in the industry. Similarly, Queenslanders will not accept a Gatton College that only offers skills training courses without an academic component. For the past 20 years Gatton has offered degree courses. Agriculture is and remains a major export earner for Queensland despite the state's future prospects in other areas, as noted by the Vice-Chancellor.</para><para>A student place at a tertiary institution is a valuable asset to a university, worth around $10,000 a student. When the University of Queensland removes student numbers from the Gatton Campus it creates a huge loss to the Gatton area and a huge loss to the agricultural future of the state. The university has been given autonomy with its funding; surely this involves a responsibility too. Queenslanders are concerned where their taxpayer funded $500 million to university education 
 goes. I am sure I speak for them when I say this must involve a specific commitment of funding for education and research into Queensland agriculture, especially when the state's leading agricultural institution is taken over by the state's largest and most diverse university. Maybe if the University of Queensland cannot find this commitment to the future of agriculture they should pass it on to a university that can. Queensland's priority must be that it has a top class agricultural teaching and research institution. Gatton College has provided this over the past 102 years and must continue to be allowed to do this by its new master, the University of Queensland.

It does not therefore preclude the Commonwealth from taking all legitimate steps in pursuing claims by it and testing or defending claims against it. The obligation not to pursue an appeal without reasonable prospects of success is not intended to prevent the Commonwealth from lodging a protective appeal to ensure that it has time to properly assess whether to pursue the matter.</para><para>The obligation applies to litigation involving Government Departments, agencies and other parties, such as Ministers and officers, where the Commonwealth indemnifies them against claims for action taken in the course of their duties. Lawyers engaged in such litigation must also act in accordance with t the obligation, whether AGS, in-house or private.</para><para>The obligation goes beyond requiring the Commonwealth and their lawyers to act honestly and in accordance with the law and court rules.

The Government has consistently underlined with the Indonesian Government the importance of ensuring that all efforts are made to create an environment in East Timor free of violence and intimidation, and that they and the security forces remain responsible for law and order and the protection of the people of East Timor.</para><para>(4) The Government recognises that the period leading to the 8 August vote will be a difficult one, and that genuine commitment by all parties to refrain from violence and intimidation will be critical. For its part, the Australian Government has 
 been focusing its efforts on ensuring that the civilian UN presence is established at the earliest opportunity, that all parties cooperate fully with the UN, and that the process is successful and free of intimidation. Ultimately, however, it is the UN's responsibility to decide if the requisite security situation exists for the ballot to proceed as scheduled, be postponed or be abandoned. Australia's response to a UN decision to abandon the ballot will be based on a consideration of the circumstances that may lead to such a decision being taken, and by the responses adopted by the parties principal to the dispute, namely the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal, the United Nations and the people of East Timor.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dementia: Residential Aged Care Services</title><page.no>5885</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 705)</subtitle><id.no>705</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5885</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 28 April 1999:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to residential aged care dementia specific services:</para><para>(1) How many places are available in each state/territory, both as a total and broken down into metropolitan and rural areas (the number of places should be provided as both an absolute figure and per 1000 people aged over 70 years).</para><para>(2) How many places are available in each state/territory, broken down into high-and low-care facilities.</para><para>(3) How many places are available in each state/territory, broken down into private and not-for-profit facilities.</para><para>(4) (a) What is the total number of places over the 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years; and (b) how many places are planned for the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 financial years.</para><para>(5) What is the occupancy rate of these places.</para><para>(6) What is the waiting times for these places in each state/territory.</para><para>(7) What information does the department have on the unmet demand for these places.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5885</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Under the Aged Care Act 1997, the Government does not approve or regulate dementia specific places or services, particularly as a very large proportion of aged care clients have dementia.

The delegation also attended a criminal trial in the New South Wales District Court and visited Long Bay Gaol.</para><para>(2) (a) The agenda for the meetings covered a wide range of domestic, regional and international human rights issues. These included: the human rights situation in Tibet and that affecting other ethnic and religious minorities within China; treatment of dissidents; legal reform; the use of the death penalty; and China's progress towards accession to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</para><para>(b) In 1997, we obtained acceptance from the Chinese side that national human rights situations were a legitimate subject for discussion between nations.

At the same time, Australia accepts that Tibet is part of China and we do not support those who campaign for Tibetan independence.</para><para>(b) The bilateral human rights dialogue is one part of a broadly-based effort to address our human rights concerns in Tibet. The Government's concern to address the problems of Tibet is also reflected in our current bilateral assistance there, in the form of a $3.4 million project near Xigaze (Shigatse) to improve primary health care and water supply which, on completion, will significantly improve the lives of ordinary Tibetans.
