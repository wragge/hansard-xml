Is the minister aware that the Reserve Bank confirmed in this month's statement on monetary policy that Japan's economy has been stagnating since April 1997—since the decision to increase the country's GST rate from three to five per cent? Isn't it a fact that Japan's series of income tax cuts in 1998 failed to kick-start the economy because consumers focused on the tax increase?

Senator, the Labor Party cannot teach this government anything at all about responsible management of the economy.

Senator, let me assure you that we wish to proceed at full speed with our tax reform programs, which include a GST and major tax cuts for individuals. We wish to proceed with our reform agenda as very well articulated by Senator Alston in telecommunications and by Peter Reith in industrial relations. This government is not afraid of reform.

I can assure the Senate that they will get more of the same 
 tonight: sound and responsible management. This has been recognised by others. The Australian Industry Group, in its May economic briefing, said:</para></talk.start><para>Australia is enjoying the fruits of a virtuous set of circumstances: strong economic growth, high productivity growth, low inflation, low interest rates, rising real incomes and a federal budget in surplus.</para><para>These indicators do not come around by chance. Just compare them with those under Labor for a moment. Since the recession Mr Keating gave this country—the one he said we had to have—Labor brought in a series of budget deficits: 1991-92, $13 billion deficit; 1992-93, $19 billion deficit; 1994-95, $14 billion deficit; 1995-96, $10 billion deficit. In the last two years Mr Beazley was finance minister $25 billion of deficit was his economic record, his legacy of debt to the Australian people that the Australian people have to pay for. The contrast we can be confident of tonight is that the budget will again be in surplus under this government.</para><para>As has been said by others, this economic achievement has been recognised around the world. I remind the Senate of what was said in the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal </inline>on Wednesday, 28 April:</para><para>Australia hasn't just avoided the Asian-Pacific downturn; it has roared ahead. While the economies of most of its Asian trading partners contracted last year, Australia's expanded 5.1 per cent, surpassing the US's 3.9 per cent pace and making it one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world.</para><para>Why was this? It was because we kept interest rates down, we took the hard decisions to reduce expenditure and we kept inflation down, giving incentive to Australian business to grow and to employ. This is being recognised by more employer organisations all the time. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry tells us, and I quote:</para><para>There is an increasingly optimistic outlook on the economy.</para><para>The chamber's latest survey of investor confidence shows that business confidence has reached its highest level since the survey commenced in 1991. Another survey from the Society of Certified Practising Accountants shows that 72 per cent of small business 
 owners felt optimistic about the business environment over the next six months, with 24 per cent planning to employ more staff. That is good news for unemployed Australians. The Morgan and Banks job index survey supports this outlook, showing that, for the third consecutive quarter, levels of optimism in relation to employment growth have continued to rise. The survey shows that more than one-third of the employers surveyed are planning to increase their permanent staffing levels. Yesterday the ANZ job vacancy figures provided further confirmation, with jobs advertisements at a post-recession high—that is, since Mr Keating's recession, jobs vacancies are now at a record high.</para><para>For this government, the job is not complete. The process of reform must continue if we are to build upon the sound foundation that we have put in place in this country. As the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants also said, the government now needs to move ahead with the GST and other business tax reforms to ensure that it does not impede the ability of small business to continue to employ more Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade Deficit</title><page.no>4715</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4715</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is also directed to Senator Hill, this time in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Trade.

 tee. What it does is take the path of Labor's failed economic record. Senator Cook stands for increased government expenditure. What does he say? He says, `Lift the cap on the EMDG Scheme'; in other words, spend more public money. That is what Labor did in all its years in government, which gave us that huge and continuing deficit that Australians had to pay for, which pushed up interest rates and put more Australians out of work. Senator Cook has not learnt a thing. It is not surprising that he was the senator who assured the Australian people, as we went into the election in 1996, that the Australian economy was not in deficit. That is how little he understood about it, as a manager of government policy with his hands on the lever. He said to the Australian people that the accounts were not in deficit when, in fact, they were $10 billion in deficit.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cook asks, `Why are imports continuing to grow?' The answer is simple. It is because the Australian economy is booming. People are buying. Why is it difficult to sell overseas? It is because Asia is struggling: a lot of Asian economies are struggling. What would you expect to happen? You would expect your markets to be more difficult and you would expect Australians to be buying more goods both internally and externally, and that is exactly what is happening. But the important point is that it is happening in an economic environment where we can afford for it to happen without getting into the awful mess of Labor in the run-up to the 1990 recession. Labor could not manage it because its deficits were so high. So Labor said that the only answer was to push up interest rates. It pushed up interest rates and sent small business to the wall. A million Australians become unemployed. Senator Cook, we do not need a lecture from you. Labor failed economically. That is why it was thrown out of government. This government has put in place economic management principles that can ensure ongoing prosperity and increasing employment and we are proud of it.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4715</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Madam President, the government living within its means, specifically in relation to the nation's finances, is something that should not be taken lightly, in our view. The Howard government respects 
 the fact that the dollars we collect come from Australian taxpayers and we believe they have a right to know where the money is being spent and that it is being spent wisely. Our record in government so far—such as implementation of the charter of budget honesty and the pre-election fiscal outlook, as opposed to Labor's two-page press release that was their mid-year review—underpins this. What this means is that before any election Australians will be told the true financial state of the nation.</para></talk.start><para>When we came to power, the coalition said that, despite the massive deficit left by the outgoing Labor government, we will commit ourselves to balancing the budget within our first term. We achieved a budget surplus within two years. Labor left a deficit of over $10 billion when, during the 1996 election, the then government was saying to Australians that the budget was in surplus.

Nine of them spent more than the government earned and they ran up some $80 billion in debt, the interest on which we have to repay. The Labor record is appalling because Labor was prepared to spend up big and let future generations of taxpayers pay for their big spending policies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leading up to tonight's budget, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, was swanning around today saying that Labor could have produced a larger surplus than the government because it would not be giving tax cuts to the rich. In response to this rubbish, let me quote Terry McCrann in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. He said:</para><para>Coming from the man who was deputy prime minister and/or finance minister in the Keating government that gave us $70 billion of budget deficits in just five years, that surplus claim has to be taken with a few trillion grains of salt.</para><para>McCrann also states correctly that at the last election Beazley Labor defined `rich' as people who earn $800 a week before tax. So if you earn around $600 per week after tax you are rich, according to the Labor Party, and not deserving of any tax cuts. The truth 
 is that Labor would not have delivered a budget surplus if it were in government. They would have tried to tell Australians that spending billions of dollars more than the nation earned was living within our means. Thankfully, the country has turned its back twice now in three years on the economic irresponsibility of Labor.

Certainly, the Innovation Investment Fund, which contributes on a matching basis about $150 million to new start-up ventures, is critically important. The software engineering centres, the test and conformance programs and the technology diffusion program, which is worth something like $108 million over four years, together with RD Start of in excess of $740 million, are critically important initiatives.</para><para>One would have thought that there would be a high level of agreement in the Australian community—and, therefore, across the political divide—that these are industries that are very well worth fostering. But what is the Labor Party's alternative approach? It is desperately disappointing. Not only, as we know, are they bound hand and foot to opposing the GST, so that in tax terms they stand for the current wholesale sales tax regime, which imposes a 22 per cent tax rate on 
 computers, printers, keyboards and other ITT equipment—in other words, the very necessary tools of trade for anyone who wants to maximise returns from the online environment—but, even worse than that, for about the past 15 years they have been trying to talk up the IT sector.</para><para> We had Barry Jones, for instance, saying that back in 1993 he tried to persuade the Hawke government to implement a national information policy approach. No luck! Lindsay Tanner, in his contribution to <inline font-style="italic">Out of the Rut</inline>, talks of the widespread acknowledgment of past failures in Labor's industry policy and says that, as far back as 1983, Labor promised support for sunrise high technology industries.

It is not just shadow boxing but basically irrelevant rhetoric, and that is no serious contribution to fostering the approach to sunrise industries such as IT. It is a very poor substitute.</para><para>It is tragic that Mr McMullan went out in January this year at the National Performance Conference, admitted that Labor had been off track and said that the debate needed to be refocused. So what did he do? He trotted out some words and said how important it all was, and then three months later did it again. Back in April, only last month, he was out there again talking about it as though somehow, if you identify an industry, you have got a policy. Mr Beazley did it last week. 	You think that talking about something makes it a policy approach. Of course, it does not. Not only will our tax proposals make all of these essential tools much cheaper and therefore much more attractive but our whole industry approach is one that very much recognises that this is a sector that will create jobs, that will not just bring vast standards of improvement in social access but will also very much 
 boost the national product. The contrast could not be starker.

I am aware of reports in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  that a Melbourne businessman has been charged with being an unlicensed prostitution provider, living off the earnings of prostitution, false imprisonment and possessing an unregistered firearm. Trafficking in people is a developing problem throughout the world. In the sex industry, trade in people essentially involves recruiting 
 people from one country and relocating them to another to work as prostitutes in servile or slave-like conditions for little, if any, reward. There are few countries today that are not in some way affected by the trade and, sadly, the indications are that Australia is becoming an important destination for the victims of this trade. The government is committed to modernising the law relating to slavery. We should not be relying on old imperial offences.</para></talk.start><para>The government is also committed to introducing new offences relating to sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting to protect persons who are employed as sex workers in servile conditions or deceived into working as sex workers when that was not their intention. It is interesting to note the penalties that would be incurred if someone is prosecuted under the current laws relating to prostitution. In Victoria, under the Prostitution Control Act, living on the earnings of a prostitute incurs a penalty of about four years in prison; forcing a person to provide financial support out of prostitution incurs seven years in prison. In New South Wales it is dealt with under the Summary Offences Act, but the penalty for living on the earnings of prostitution is 12 months in prison, and allowing premises to be used is also 12 months in prison. Penalties in other states are broadly similar.</para><para>However, it is important to note that the Commonwealth's  Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Bill 1999  provides for qualitatively different penalties. I urge members of the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens to publicly indicate their support for this bill. It is one we could get through with a minimum of fuss and demonstrate some goodwill all around, because this bill has qualitatively different penalties. It provides for penalties of up to 25 years for a person who intentionally possesses a slave and it provides for penalties of up to 15 years for the basic offence where a person causes another to enter into or remain in sexual servitude. It is an important bill.

One of the things we will not hear anything about is the abysmal performance of this government in terms of managing its trade account and the abysmal performance of this government in racking up levels of foreign debt that are now a record. Let us just go to three figures. Australia has the largest ever trade deficit in its history—over $10 billion of trade deficit in the year 1998. We have the largest ever 
 current account deficit. It was over $28 billion in 1998. And we have the highest foreign debt—defined as net foreign liabilities—of over $350 billion at the current level. That is to say, this government has brought in the trifecta: the largest ever trade deficit, the largest ever current account deficit, and the largest level of foreign debt in the history of this nation. We will not hear very much from Mr Costello tonight about answers to those problems, if the answer by Senator Hill in question time today is any guide.</para><para>We ought to consider this. Australia has been a sovereign nation for 98 years. In that time we have had 35 Treasurers. Peter Costello is the 35th Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has done what none of the other 34 could do. He has managed, as I say, the trifecta: record trade deficit, record current account deficit and record foreign debt. When we went to the election in 1996 honourable senators may remember the Liberal Party debt truck rolling through the hills and breaking down in the Blue Mountains, claiming that the Labor government at that time was making sure that foreign debt was out of control. Foreign debt is out of control and it has sky-rocketed since those days under the very government that promised it would break the back of foreign debt. It has done so. Foreign debt is reeling out of control and is now a major economic problem for the country.</para><para>When we asked the government today what they are going to do about it, what did they say? They blamed Asia as the cause of their problems. What do they otherwise say? They say that they will not spend any money to help Australian exporters develop new markets in other parts of the world to overcome the problems. We are buying more than we are selling on our external account. We are importing more than we are exporting. Imports are going up and exports are going down. The gap is widening. It cannot continue without bringing major economic problems to the domestic economy.</para><para>Let me go through the figures on the trade deficit. Not only did the trade deficit for 1998 top $10 billion but also the trade figures released last week paint a very bleak picture. 
 In trend terms, the deficit for March was $1.4 billion, the fifth successive record monthly trade deficit ever, and exports fell and imports rose. But it gets worse. In trend terms, Australia has had a trade deficit for the past 22 months, since the middle of 1997. We have had a trade deficit since—remember these people—Geoff Prosser, John Sharp and David Jull were ministers. That is how long it has been going.</para><para>Let me turn for a moment to the balance of payments deficit. Australia's current account deficit in 1998 was over $28 billion. This represents an increase over the previous year, 1997, of 67 per cent. It is ballooning out of control. It cannot be blamed on growth either. The rate of the current account deficit to GDP is now five per cent higher than when the coalition came to office. The ratio of the current account deficit to GDP is steadily increasing. It has grown every quarter since December last year.</para><para>On foreign debt, our net foreign liabilities are now $350 billion. That not only is an all-time record but also is up more than a fifth from when the coalition was first elected in 1996. If tonight Treasurer Costello pretends that he has won the gold medal for Australia, he has in fact won the wooden spoon on the trade deficit, on the current account deficit and on our net foreign debt. There will be no cry tonight of `Gold, gold, gold, Costello!' It is the wooden spoon all the way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4728</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is very sad when you have to get up and respond to a former failed minister, now a tired spokesman for an opposition that have no policies of their own to advance and that have a record, whilst in government, of 13 years of abysmal economic performance. The sheer audacity of them, I have to say, is absolutely astounding. The leader under which Senator Cook serves was the finance minister of this country. For the two years that he was finance minister, the federal budget deficit racked up $24 billion worth. In other words, 25 per cent of the federal government debt that had been incurred from 1901 through to 1996 was incurred in the two years that Mr Beazley was the finance minister. Indeed, 
 Senator Cook was a senior minister in that government, and he has the absolute audacity to come into this chamber and try to lecture and hector us about economic performance.</para></talk.start><para>The worst economic performance that any government could have is one million people unemployed. Senator Cook was the chief architect of government policy at that time under Labor. That is the worst social statistic that any country could have, and Senator Cook presided over that. Was there any mention of that today? No, because we have brought unemployment down, haven't we, to 7.4 per cent. That is the lowest it has been in the 1990s.</para><para>What about the budget deficit that Labor used to have? It is down; down to a surplus. The surplus is being used to pay off Labor's debts—the debts that people like Senator Cook racked up. They have the audacity to come into this chamber and try to tell us that somehow they have all of the economic answers. The reality is that, whilst Asia was booming, Labor was racking up budget deficit after budget deficit. Yet whilst we have been in government, Asia has been in crisis but we have been able to return budget surpluses. How have we done that? We have done that by sound economic management. As a result, interest rates have gone down, home loan affordability has gone up and small business loan affordability has gone up. As a result, employment opportunities have gone up and unemployment has come down. This is in stark contradistinction to all of those indicators whilst Labor was in government and especially while Senator Cook was parading as industry minister.</para><para>The Labor Party have a feeling that Australia is going to get another excellent Costello budget tonight so they are desperately trying to scratch around to find some sort of indicator that might take some of the gloss off the budget that will be delivered tonight. I am sure that the people who are currently in the budget lockup, from the media and elsewhere, going through the budget documentation will be more than satisfied that the budget being brought down tonight will deliver further economic recovery to this great country and will undo the damage done by Mr Beazley 
 and Senator Cook whilst they had charge of the economic management of this country.</para><para>It is the height of audacity and duplicity for Senator Cook—with the failed past economic performance over which he presided—to come into this place and try to hector and lecture us about economic performance. We were judged at the last election on economic performance and we were re-elected. In support of that mandate given to us, we will be delivering another excellent budget this evening.

Senator Abetz attempted to give us a lecture about budget deficits and not trade deficits. Trade deficit concerns imports and exports. Maybe Senator Abetz does not know what it is all about. That is the issue relating to trade deficits, not budget deficits. Senator Cook asked Senator Hill about a very serious issue which goes to the fundamental future of the economy of Australia: the trade deficit. We had the second highest trade deficit on record in March and an accumulated total to date of $35 billion, or approximately 6 per cent of the economy's output. This is at a time when the economy is growing strongly. It is interesting to note that on previous occasions when we have had significant trade deficits it has been as a consequence of a drought or at a time of recession. To have a trade deficit at this time, when the economy is growing strongly, is a problem. What is going to happen when the economy grows less strongly at some point in time?</para></talk.start></continue><para>This large deficit raises questions about the country's ability to repay debt. The Treasurer, 
 Mr Costello, continues to maintain that the best way of sustaining and underwriting our national debt is to have a surplus on the Commonwealth budget. To that extent Senator Abetz's comments were remotely relevant. The Treasurer asserts that he does not want to add to the blow-out of the budget deficit. I will return to that point a little later. What is interesting in the latest figures is that our exports were assisted by gold sales going up by $261 million to $9.3 billion. That is before the latest decline in gold sales. We all remember that the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, touched off a decline in gold sales. Since then I notice that the Swiss and now the British have been announcing a sell-off of gold, and we certainly will not see this improved export performance in gold in the near future. It is also interesting to note that imports rose by 9.3 per cent in the nine months to March but exports rose by just 0.2 per cent. We do not hear any more about the debt truck. Remember the debt truck that the Liberal Party in opposition used to drive around? It is in the garage, and I do not think we are going to see that truck for a long time.</para><para>What are the consequences of this massive trade deficit for Australia? The reality is that to sustain that debt we have to import capital. We have to import capital in ever increasing amounts because if we do not we cannot pay for our imports. The other particular problem we have is that we have a very low, and declining, national savings level. National savings is a relevant issue; not the budget surplus but national savings is the most important issue in relation to paying for imported capital. As we have to import so much capital to meet the trade deficit, there is only one way to do that: sell off Australian assets and transfer ownership of Australian assets overseas.</para><para>In the last few weeks the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned about the consequences of and all the hoopla concerning government budget surpluses. The big problem is that government surpluses and savings have been achieved at the cost of declining household savings. This government has transferred savings from the pockets of Australians to government savings. So you have a neutral 
 outcome in terms of total savings levels in this country, and in fact we have declining national savings. Interestingly, national savings are close to zero at the present time. For Australians to pay the ever increasing national debt, we will have to sell off our assets, increasing foreign ownership, as I have said. That is, of course, until Australian consumers run up to their debt limit, and I suspect that we are fast reaching that point. Add the impact of a GST and we will have a very unfortunate recipe for the economy when it slows. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>4730</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to redress in the time available to me those intellectually impecunious comments made by Senator Cook and Senator Sherry.

Why didn't they say that? Why didn't they also mention that Mr Beazley, now the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, in the two years that he was finance minister racked up $23 billion of debt? We are not talking about $6 billion; we are talking about $23 billion in two years, in the last year of which, when he said there was going to be a surplus in the economy, he produced a $10 billion deficit—the infamous $10 billion black hole of Mr Beazley.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition would also have you believe that we do not have the largest job vacancies on record in Australia right now, that we do not have low interest rates and that we do not have low inflation rates. Why weren't those things mentioned? The opposition want to destroy what is the fastest growing economy in the world, coupled to the lowest inflation. What other evidence do we have of the Labor Party wanting to destroy? No phoenix rises out of the Labor Party ashes; none at all. They want to destroy small business in the 
 same manner as they are trying to destroy this economy with their failure to pass the amendments to the unfair dismissal laws. They wanted to destroy the states, and they still do, by bypassing the states and having a plan to fund local government. They wanted to destroy the workplace by failing to pass workplace agreements. They wanted to destroy the mining industry in Australia, the backbone of Australia's economy, by failing to pass the Native Title Amendment Act and putting a lot of the people they purport to represent out of work. They want to destroy that. They want to destroy it in Western Australia by not passing complementary native title amendment bills.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>—You wanted to secede.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—I remind the Senate—over and above Senator George Campbell's raucous outburst—that in fact the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, comes from Western Australia.

But when it comes to raising issues and questions about the foreign debt that this country faces, what have they said since 1996? Very little indeed. This is an issue that they put squarely on the agenda prior to the last election. They made foreign debt the central economic argument in this country in 1996. They built the debt truck; they took it around this country, saying to Australians that their standard of living was going to be destroyed because they owed $10,000 per person to the rest of the world for Australia's foreign debt.</para><para>Let us compare what they said in 1996 with what has happened in fact over the past three years. Let us look at what the Prime Minister said, in response to a journalist, when he launched the debt truck on 20 September 1995. The journalist asked:</para><para>Can you promise that foreign debt will be lowered in the first year of the Howard Government?</para><para>The Prime Minister said:</para><para>I can promise you that we will follow policies which will, over a period of time, bring down the foreign debt.</para><para>He was asked:</para><para>Over what time frame?</para><para>He said:</para><para>I can't put figures on it in months, I can't.</para><para>In response to a further question by the journalist:</para><para>Will that be your first priority if you win Government?</para><para>he said:</para><para>Our first priority as Peter Costello and I have made repeatedly clear, our first priority in Government economically will be to tackle the current account deficit.</para><para>Haven't they done a wonderful job in carrying out their priority? What is the foreign debt? In March 1996, when they took power, net debt was $191 billion. In December last year it had risen to $236 billion, a growth of some $50 billion in a period of something like 2½ years—a wonderful carrying out of their commitment to reduce foreign debt; a wonderful performance on their priority. But what is the current account deficit? It has now risen from 4.7 per cent of GDP in March 1996 to five per cent in December last year, another significant performance on the priority commitments that they made to the Australian people.</para><para>What did the Prime Minister go on to say that day in respect of the foreign debt? He said:</para><para>. . . we've run up that $180 billion over the last decade because of bad economic policies—</para><para>so he judged our economic policies on the basis of the foreign debt that we had run up—</para><para>which have allowed us over a . . . period of time to import far more than we have exported, and because of our low savings we've borrowed the 
 difference, we've borrowed from foreigners in order to buy the surplus imports, and that's why we have an enormous foreign debt that's feeding into our interest rate bill to our daily bills. The fact that in the last decade, the household debt in this country has gone from 45 to 65 cents of disposable income—it's one of the reasons why Australians feel a lot worse off . . .</para><para>Let us have a look at what household debt is today. The Prime Minister said it was 65c of disposable income in September 1995. In December 1998 it is 90.45 per cent of disposable income—a significant jump over the 2½-year period of this government. I think a most telling point was an explanation of the Liberal Party in respect of that truck back in September 1995—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4732</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If we look at a Bible reference—they were wise and far-seeing people in those days—a prophet was always one except in his own country and was always acknowledged as such. I think that is very much true of the perspective of the Australian Labor Party when they view the performance of the Australian economy. They are blind to what is happening in their own country, and a lot of the rhetoric we hear today is reminiscent of that particular phobia or that past approach.</para></talk.start><para>Let us examine some of the articles appearing overseas that indicate how people overseas perceive Australia. I submit that they perceive Australia to be in a far healthier state, to be a more prosperous country, than what is portrayed here today. First of all, let us look at what the Singaporeans say, and I quote from the eminent <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> of Wednesday, 28 April 1999:</para><para>Australia hasn't just avoided the Asian-Pacific downturn, it has roared ahead. While the economies of most of its Asian trading partners contracted last year, Australia expanded 5.1 per cent, surpassing the US's 3.9 pace and making it one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world . . . 1999 is likely to be the eighth consecutive year of growth.</para><para>That is certainly good news; the sort of diatribe we heard a few minutes ago is not. After a decade of unflattering comparisons with Asia's once booming economies, Australia is now basking in praise from the most unlikely sources, including the proud 
 Singaporeans who had looked down on Australians as their poor cousins.</para><para>Let us look at the performance of exporters, because it used to be said that Australia rides on the sheep's back. No more. The variety of Australian exports is expanding. We are going into new markets with new products. I come back to the eminent <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> to see what it has to say:</para><para>Australian exporters, which deregulation and privatisation had forced to become more nimble, diverted their wares from sinking Asian economies to healthier ones elsewhere. When the South Korean market went sour, for example, Qantas Airways deployed aircraft on the more promising Indian routes. As Indonesia's economic crash hampered sales of live cattle there, Australian producers began wooing buyers in Mexico and Libya. All told, Australia's sales of goods to Asia including Japan slid six per cent last year in value terms from 1997 while exports to the US and Europe climbed 34 and 42 per cent respectively. The total exports of goods and services rose in 1998 by a modest two per cent.</para><para>We see there that overseas people view Australia in a very positive light.</para><para>Australia's propensity to save will increase quite significantly with the passage of a number of bills, hopefully this month or next month, when 80 per cent of Australians will have a tax rate of 30 per cent or less. With such a higher disposable income there is a greater propensity to save. Foreign debt is made up of a number of components. There is government debt, of which Commonwealth debt is a declining proportion.</para><para>I would like to draw the Senate's attention in this debate to an issue put forward by Jubilee 2000 which is asking some of the richer countries of the world to actually write off some of the debt of the Third World—those countries whose living standards are declining because of repatriation problems and the meeting of interest commitments. I commend that particular approach to all the wealthier countries around the world.</para><para>Undoubtedly, Australia's current account deficit has been affected by lower export prices. We are all aware of the pressure under which some of our exporters are placed. This has been reflected in share prices. There has been pressure from reduced prices for exports 
 of coal, iron ore and those sorts of things, but we have a strong domestic economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>4733</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Sexuality Discrimination</title><page.no>4733</page.no><no.signed>462</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Bartlett</name><name> Sen Andrew</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned shows:</para><para>That Australian citizens oppose social, legal and economic discrimination against people on the basis of their sexuality or transgender identity and that such discrimination is unacceptable in a democratic society.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id></talker><para>Senator Bartlett(from 462 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Timed Local Calls</title><page.no>4733</page.no><no.signed>20</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>FX5</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Murphy</name><name> Sen Shayne</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate the regressive decision by the Howard Government to allow small businesses to be charged for timed local calls on data services such as electronic mail, facsimile, the internet and other on-line services.

How will the Government ensure Tasmania is treated fairly in comparison to the more affluent and larger States? Tasmania, on a per capita basis, has the highest unemployment, lowest average weekly wage, the oldest population, the greatest number of people dependent on government income support and the most decentralised population of any State of Australia. The Government's model for estimating the cost of the GST does not allow for the different economic and social patterns between states.</para><para>2. How will the government ensure families can afford good food which will be relatively more expensive in respect to `junk' foods whose price will decrease after the removal of sales tax? Tasmanians pay the highest costs for food in Australia and are among the worst health status population in Australia.</para><para>3. How will the government ensure that organisations and charities can continue to provide the necessary community services and support to disadvantaged citizens? Community organisations and charities in Tasmania will face a double jeopardy from the implementation of the Tax Package. It is predicted that poverty in Tasmania will increase and more people will be seeking extra assistance. At the same time organisations will have a reduced capacity to meet those needs because of increased administrative costs associated with compliance and in many instances reduced revenue because of the application of the tax to such things as membership fees and fund raising.</para><para>4. How will government ensure that service quality and scope of education, child care and health services can be maintained without increasing the costs of these services? The Government proposes that essential services such as education, child care and health will be GST Free. However, community based organisations offering these services will have increased costs arising from the extra administration and accounting requirements of the tax package.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name><name.id>FX5</name.id></talker><para>Senator Murphy(from 89 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id></talker><para>Senator O'Brien(from 87 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Student Unionism</title><page.no>4733</page.no><no.signed>10</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>10000</name.id></name.ids><names><name>The PRESIDENT</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President of the Senate and Senators assembled in Parliament.

 Estimates funding had been sought. 1998-9 budget allocations were used to fund strategically important projects such as restructuring, computer replacements and enhancements to the ANAO's Financial Management and Human Resource Management Systems.</para><para>The Auditor General told the Committee that there were a number of significant changes to the environment in which the 1999-2000 Budget and forward estimates were constructed, the most important of these being the implementation of an accrual budgeting framework for the Commonwealth to take effect with the 1999-2000 Budget. The ANAO has for some years been costing its products on an accrual basis and is well placed to move to an accrual based budget. The ANAO has also implemented, with effect from 1 July 1998, a new Financial Management Information System to support the revised financial management framework.</para><para>The implementation of accrual budgeting is accompanied by the introduction of an Outcomes and Outputs structure which will replace the existing program structures. The new framework places a particular focus on the outputs, or goods and services produced by agencies, and the links between them and the desired outcomes of Government activity. The ANAO's outputs are defined as follows:</para><para>1.	 Performance Audit Services</para><para>2.	 Information Support Services</para><para>3.	 Assurance Audit Services.</para><para>The key elements of ANAO's business as summarised in the Auditor-General's submission are:</para><para>.	 Running costs account for the significant majority of ANAO resources;</para><para>.	 Property operating expenses, covered by a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Finance, are included in running costs;</para><para>.	 under the accrual budgeting environment, the previous system of annual appropriations for agencies will be replaced by appropriations for Departmental items and appropriations for Administered items;</para><para>.	 for the ANAO, future appropriations will, for the most part relate to Departmental items. The Auditor-General's salary and allowances will continue to be funded by the special appropriation under the Auditor-General Act.</para><para>The total budget allocation being sought for 1999-2000 is $53.6 million.</para><para>In terms of output groups, the Performance Audit Services Output Group estimates were for $18.7 million, the Information Support Services Output Group estimates were for $1.7 million and the Assurance Audit Services Output Group estimates 
 were for $26.6 million. Although the Auditor-General understands that carryovers will not form part of the budget parameters beyond 1999-2000, it is proposed, in line with existing practice, to maintain a strategic reserve fund which is needed to assist in the management of the ANAO's business.</para><para>The process by which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has begun to fulfil  its enhanced responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act, and the Financial  Management and Accountability Act has continued to evolve during this year. It is only by  the experience of deliberating on matters like the appointment of the Independent  Auditor, and the approval of ANAO's draft budget estimates that the practical extent of  the Committee's powers of scrutiny can be defined in a way which enhances the powers  of the Parliament to keep government accountable.</para><para>(signed)</para><para>Bob Charles MP</para><para>Chairman</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4738</page.no><id.no>r732</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (RECEIVER LICENCE TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r729</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (TRANSMITTER LICENCE TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r731</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title><page.no>4738</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>4738</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Eggleston, I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 and two related bills, together with submissions.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>—I advise the Senate that the report has only just been sent to the printer and copies are not expected to be available until late tonight.

However, an electronic copy of the report will be available on the Internet very shortly.</para><para>I present the report of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies entitled  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  which looks at legislation to regulate online services. Schedule 2 of the bill makes a consequential amendment to the Crimes Act 1914. The committee held four days of public hearings and took evidence from 33 witnesses, resulting in more than 320 pages of transcript. The committee also received 104 submissions on the legislation covering industry, interest groups and the community.</para><para>There was overwhelming support from witnesses that what is regulated offline should also have a regulatory framework online. The legislation will operate as a three-way partnership between parents, government and industry. This partnership was put very succinctly by a representative of Young Media Australia, Ms Toni Jupe, when she told the committee:</para><para>We agree that parents ought to take a greater degree of responsibility but, as with other forms of media, we also believe that there should be a triangular partnership on this matter between the Government, industry and the community.</para><para>The legislation extends the existing system of classifying material from film and broadcasting to the Internet. Such consistency will 
 ensure that community standards are protected as widely as possible. It provides a clear legislative framework for the protection of all Australians from illegal and highly offensive material.</para><para>The committee believes the government's approach accommodates emerging technologies and recognises the dynamic nature of the electronic industry, recognising that what is not possible today may in fact be possible tomorrow. The range of witnesses who appeared before the committee reflected the vigorous debate which has been taking place within the Internet community about this legislation and this has mainly covered three broad themes: that the legislation in some way restricts freedom of speech; that it is imposing technical restrictions on the Internet which will slow access speeds and destroy electronic commerce; and that it dismisses the fact that the responsibility for protecting children from harmful Internet content should rest with government, parents and the industry.</para><para>Evidence received from both industry and community representatives largely addressed these concerns. Firstly, the Australian media and broadcast mediums already operate in a regulated environment. There is no absolute freedom of speech. A large amount of printed material is also subject to classification. This legislation simply extends the existing system of classification from film and television to the Internet. It will ensure that the community will be protected in as broad a sense as possible.</para><para>There was no evidence presented to the committee that paedophilia or sexually explicit or violent material should be freely available on the Internet. In fact, Ms Fiona Patten from the Eros Foundation told the committee, `If material is restricted to adults in any other medium, it should be restricted to adults on the Net.'</para><para>Concerns that the legislation imposes technical restrictions on the Net which would slow access speeds and interfere with electronic commerce were also resolved by expert industry witnesses. Mr Alan Jones, Chief Executive Officer of Clairview Internet Pty Ltd, told the committee:</para><para>One issue that was brought up in the CSIRO report that I found interesting was the comments of how e-commerce could be hurt by such blocking. Whilst it is true that blocking will hurt e-commerce sites that co-host pornographic material with their sites, I think the worry of it will be almost negligible.</para><para>The committee heard from Dr Philip McCrea, one of the co-authors of the June 1998 CSIRO report, that filtering is technically possible. He said:</para><para>When done by backbone service providers possibly packet level filtering would be the most appropriate. When done at the ISP level, then probably filtering against `black lists' would be the most appropriate.</para><para>Dr McCrea told the committee:</para><para>The second approach recognises that it is possible to provide some sort of filtering by an ISP. Our conclusion was that this is probably the most effective form of filtering.</para><para>Young Media Australia pressed upon the committee the need for parents and guardians to understand that this media is unregulated and something needs to be done about it. They said:</para><para>We feel that we represent the broad parent community that feels that it is not really across the more technical aspects of some of these issues, yet they are being told on a daily basis that virtually all the responsibility for doing something about the protection of their children from any harmful effects of the technology is entirely their responsibility.</para><para>This legislation does not remove the responsibility of parents, guardians or individuals to manage their and their children's use of the Internet. In fact, the committee agrees with this and welcomes the government's approach to encourage parents to utilise the existing filtering software and suitable search engines.</para><para>America Online presented evidence to the committee that, of their 17 million members worldwide, 53 per cent are families and of that group 82 per cent already use the parental control systems which America Online offers. Dr Ritz, America Online's business affairs director said:</para><para>We think that there is a very strong argument that these parental controls, if they are made easy, do work and parents can use them.</para><para>The government's approach to the resolution of children gaining access to inappropriate online material does not rely just on this 
 legislation because there is a community consensus that wider community education is an important part of the framework to regulate online services. The committee took the view that this form of education was equally as important as the package of measures put forward by the government. Of course at the end of the day, extensive community education does not represent a total solution to the problem of inappropriate material being available online.</para><para>The committee welcomes the establishment of the proposed community advisory committee, which will be an important adjunct to the ABA and will, in the committee's opinion, give this important element of the government's package the level of priority it deserves. The committee recognised that emerging technologies will always entail people finding ways around technical restrictions but felt that the overall success of the measures should take into account general compliance rather than simply measure universal compliance.</para><para>The committee has recommended that several areas of the legislation be further investigated and commented upon. These include the lack of a specific reference to technical feasibility in the legislation; the practical difficulties of complying with `take down' orders, for example, on non-working days; further explanation of the differing roles of states and territories with the Commonwealth; and the need to clarify the responsibility of Internet content providers. However, the committee recommended that the legislation be supported.

The shadow minister for communications made 
 three key points in respect of the referral of this bill to the IT committee for investigation. Firstly, he said that the opposition supported a workable and feasible regulation of Internet content which placed realistic roadblocks in the way of children being exposed to content unacceptable by community standards. Secondly, he said that the government's announcement was duplicitous because it deliberately sought to create the impression that the government's announced measure would solve the problem of unacceptable content, when the reality is—backed by CSIRO advice and industry analysis—that it is not feasible to regulate such content as over 90 per cent of offensive content comes from offshore. Thirdly, he suggested in his press release that the sensible public policy approach to Internet content is to empower parents and schools, particularly by way of information about end use filter devices.</para></talk.start><para>The bill was referred to the select committee, public hearings have been conducted and the committee is reporting today. Debate on the bill is listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> to commence this Thursday in the Senate. A brief description of the legislation is appropriate so that we understand the matter that we are discussing. Firstly, the legislation seeks to regulate content on the Internet through amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act. Secondly, the legislation introduces a content rating regime for the Internet analogous to that in existence for broadcast and narrow cast technology and requires the industry to develop an industry code of conduct to address the issues. Thirdly, the legislation empowers the Australian Broadcasting Authority to oversee regulation and adherence to the code and to develop an ABA standard by 1 March 2000 if an industry code is not ratified by 1 January that year.</para><para>Fourthly, the legislation effects a process by which the ABA, on complaint about material, can require an Internet service provider to take down X or refuse classification rated material hosted onshore and to take all reasonable steps to prevent access to X or refuse classification rated material hosted offshore. In respect of R classified onshore content, the ABA must be satisfied that restricted access 
 arrangements—PIN, password or age—are in place and no proposal is made in respect of offshore classified R material. The bill specifies time frames for the take-down process and penalties for non-compliance. The bill does not apply to live Internet content such as news groups, chat channels or email.</para><para>Initial industry reactions to the legislation can only be described as hostile. Major criticisms have included the following: firstly, that content regulation is inappropriate for the Internet medium and, as a matter of principle, there should be no restrictions at all on Internet content; secondly, that the proposals in respect of offshore content regulation are unworkable; thirdly, that the proposals would place an onerous economic burden on Internet service providers; and, fourthly, that the proposals would reduce or destroy Australia's attractiveness as an Internet e-commerce jurisdiction.</para><para>Industry reaction to the detail of the legislation during the select committee hearings was hostile. In particular, detailed criticisms made at public hearings and via written submissions have included that a 24 hour take-down period for onshore content is far too short, that the penalty regime is excessive and punitive, and that the legislation does not expressly specify what `all reasonable steps' are required to be taken in respect of offshore content.</para><para>The opposition has considered a range of the submissions made to the committee, and we express publicly the following concerns. Firstly, the legislation is not being dealt with on its merits but is linked to a 1 July 1999 timetable which has caused indecent haste and inadequate and less than thorough consideration of the technical aspects and the merit of the bill. Secondly, we regard with sadness but with ongoing anger the duplicity of the government's presentation to the general public of the effectiveness of the regime to control offshore content. Thirdly, there is the unworkability of the proposals and the ease with which they can be bypassed by a range of individuals; and an acknowledgment, but not unthinking acceptance, of the narrow casting classification regime in respect of the Internet medium, together with an acknow 
 ledgment that this may well have to be revisited in the future, particularly in the light of whatever changes convergence of technology brings.</para><para>The Commonwealth needs to pursue international arrangements in respect of Internet content and regulation. We suggest that the real solution to the mischief at hand—being end use empowerment—is extensive education and information campaigns for parents and schools in respect of the Internet and end use filter devices.</para><para>When the bill comes before the Senate for consideration later this week or in the next fortnight, the opposition will be presenting a range of significant amendments. These amendments will provide, firstly, that the 24 hour take-down period be extended to 48 hours and apply only after a process of real and effective notification of a breach; secondly, that the proposed penalty regime be reduced; thirdly, that all reasonable steps be expressly defined to include end user empowerment, information provision and advice on culturally appropriate end use filter devices, and that such reasonable steps be technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective; that the Australian Broadcasting Authority take into account the public interest in not requiring steps which would reduce national Internet capacity; and that the ABA also take into account the public interest in ensuring that Australia remains an attractive Internet e-commerce investment jurisdiction by not requiring measures which would unreasonably degrade Internet capacity or utility.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>4741</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before discussing some of the important conclusions that are in the Democrats' minority report, I would like to briefly touch on the process leading up to the tabling of this report before the Senate and to put forward concerns that have been raised a number of times. Indeed, the last speaker pointed out some of the opposition's concerns about the haste with which this process has been pursued.</para></talk.start><para>Senators would be aware that the minister announced the government's proposals to regulate the Internet in mid-March, and it is still unclear as to whether or not the government intends this legislation to be its entire response to the recommendations of previous Senate committees which have addressed these issues. That is one area out of two where I agree with Senator Harradine's minority report—of what I have just read. He mentions that `privacy considerations are of utmost importance to our committee', and I would concur with that. Secondly, I think there are many outstanding recommendations from previous Senate committees which have not been addressed. I may not necessarily agree with some of those recommendations, but we are still waiting to find out if the government intends this as its entire response.</para><para>Turning now to the process, in mid-April the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 was introduced into the Senate. Two days later, on 23 April, the government moved that the bill be referred to the recently re-established Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. I reiterate the concern of the Democrats and many others about the timing and manner of the government's investigation into this bill—it was unnecessarily hurried. While I do not doubt the urgency or the importance of the issue of Internet content regulation, I am concerned that, because the process was so speedy, it was not able to comprehensively address many of the issues raised by the legislation.</para><para>The Democrats have said many times that we are concerned that the reference of that legislation to the Senate select committee has been used a mechanism for justifying the legislation. There has not been adequate time to develop or pursue some of the more intricate, technical and other issues that were raised in those committee hearings.</para><para>The Democrats have carefully examined the bill and have prepared a minority report which addresses, we think, some of the significant issues that the government has downplayed. We want to make it quite clear that we believe the regime envisaged by this 
 bill is both unworkable and undesirable. We have two broad areas of concern with this legislation as it has been presented to the Senate. The first of these relates to the significant technical and operational concerns with the proposal which could render the regime unworkable.</para><para>The second concern relates to undesirable aspects of the legislation. These include the failure to address civil liberties concerning privacy and the freedom of speech and expression, the creation of broad discretions and uncertain law enforcement provisions, the different treatment of material in different media, the almost certain adverse impact on the Internet industry in Australia, the likely impact on the growth of the information economy in Australia, and the failure to address concerns about the likelihood of inappropriate and inadvertent blocking of materials and related issues.</para><para>The bill envisages different systems for content hosted in Australia and content hosted overseas. The primary reason for this distinction is obviously jurisdictional, but the distinction is invisible to most Internet users. I will address the provisions dealing with Australian-hosted content shortly, but I wish to draw specific attention to the technical problems involved in blocking content hosted overseas. Firstly, I note that even some of the world's most restrictive governments have abandoned attempts to engage in wholesale blocking of Internet content. Most recently, the Malaysian government announced that they would cease Internet censorship. In that country one of the effects of Internet censorship was to prevent the distribution of materials concerning political opposition.</para><para>The committee heard evidence from Dr Philip McCrae about the technical issues involved in blocking Internet content. He presented a report on the technical feasibility of blocking technologies, originally commissioned by the National Office of Information Economy. That report raised many serious concerns about performance degradation and the possibility that blocking schemes can be easily circumvented. Neither of these concerns can be dismissed lightly, certainly not in light of the evidence presented to the committee.</para><para>The bill also contains a number of undesirable provisions. Some of the more significant issues fall under the general heading of civil liberties—in particular, I am referring to restrictions on the freedom to publish and to view materials which may be legal in other media. Witnesses referred to the general chilling effect on Australian content creators, who are obviously going to be fairly wary of creating content when it is not clear which materials may or may not be restricted. Concerns have been raised that this bill would be likely to have a significant impact on the creation of all types of content in Australia. The Democrats do not believe that the government has fulfilled the onus to justify further restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of expression in Australia.</para><para>Serious concerns also arise from the broad discretions and somewhat arbitrary enforcement provisions in the bill—in particular, the so-called anti-avoidance provisions, which refer to the prohibition of substantially similar content. They would appear to require Internet service providers to be involved in almost editorial decisions about the content being hosted on their servers. The two-year rule, which prevents reclassification of materials for two years, could be used in conjunction with the anti-avoidance provisions and generic descriptions of material to prevent or prohibit excessive amounts of content.</para><para>The government has not addressed either the direct costs or the likely economic impact of the proposed legislation, which we find absolutely extraordinary. We have heard repeatedly from the government that it is friendly towards electronic commerce, yet it has remained silent on the economic implications of the proposals before us. We think it is outrageous to suggest that these proposals would have no economic impact, and there was very little evidence before the committee of the possible costs of implementing such proposals. But many witnesses indicated that the direct costs and broader economic impact were likely to be detrimental to the rapid growth of both Internet use and the information economy.</para><para>While recommending the use of blocking technologies as a compulsory part of the 
 content control regime, the government has failed to address some significant concerns with the operation of filtering and blocking tools. As I have indicated to the Senate on previous occasions, the problems of inappropriate and inadvertent blocking of materials must be addressed, and submissions to the committee indicated significant concerns with the blocking of materials relating to the safe use of drugs, safe sex, gay and lesbian issues, feminism, anti-hate speech sites and many other types of material, including political material. I seek leave to incorporate the last four paragraphs of my comments so I do not take the time of the Senate.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Indeed, recent analysis of one of the blocking technologies presented to the committee has demonstrated the inadvertent blocking of very large numbers of web sites hosted on the same servers as some less appropriate materials, in one case blocking access to the National Party web site.</para><para>It is crucial that the operation of content control in a liberal democracy is open and accountable. We certainly need to ensure that the value systems and the decisions made in blocking content are explicit.</para><para>These concerns, and others, have been addressed in the Democrats' report.</para><para>The Democrats would prefer an approach to the regulation of Internet content based on the empowerment and education of users. We would also wish to encourage an understanding of the responsibility of adults supervising Internet use by young people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>4743</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be quite brief because the previous speakers have covered much of the terrain I would cover, except to say, however, that it is quite untoward that, once again, the Senate is fast-forward on moves to ban sexually explicit material available to Australians without proper consultation with the community and without proper time for deliberation in this place.</para></talk.start><para>It does not miss my notice that the government today is announcing a clampdown on so-called sex chat lines advertised in Australia and apparently under frequent use. What a coincidence that that is happening on budget day! I think that many Australians would want to have input on that as well. What we 
 are seeing here is a breakout of censorship, a rapid grab of the rights of Australians to see, hear or tune into material that they think is appropriate for themselves. Any society has to be concerned about the impact of material on young people, and I am second to none on that.</para><para>What I find particularly repugnant, however, is the increasing violence; in particular, the Americanisation of our culture—the bringing of the culture of violence into Australia without restriction. That is a far greater priority than what people may do, see or say about sexual explicitness, which is not of the same order. Here we have this move to be prurient about sexually explicit material and an outbreak of it at a time when we are moving to consider the GST and the sale of Telstra. I have no doubt that Senator Harradine will have more to say about this in a moment, but I think we have to call a spade a spade here. The government has this on the agenda because it is wanting to influence Senator Harradine's vote and Senator Colston's vote on the GST, on the sale of Telstra and on the general list of government priorities which we have before us before 1 July.</para><para>Whatever else one might think about this debate, that is not the right way to meet the priorities of Australians as a whole. There are very critical matters to be dealt with by the Senate which are being put aside to get through this censorship agenda. Very critical matters are being put aside by a government agenda to trade the restriction on what adult Australians might see or hear for its other agendas. As I said before, it is up to the government to be at least transparent about this. I again call for the government to release the minutes of the meetings which have been held between the Independents, the various ministers and, indeed, the Prime Minister in the preceding months so that we may see what the agenda has been. I doubt it is an agenda which has been overtly one of trading, although that is the result we are seeing in here.</para><para>I find it quite remarkable that there is such a licence for advertising sexual services and so on throughout the media in Australia— 
some of it illegal—to the gain of the big media empires in this country. There seems to be no crackdown under the law on those things, yet we have this move to censor what Australians might see or hear on the Internet or through other modalities.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—You want to clean up the Net, don't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—The problem is that there has not been proper consideration given to this.

That is why my priority is, for example, to get up an inquiry into the impact of gambling on the Internet, which is going to be far more injurious to many Australian families than whatever non-violent material—sexually explicit as it may be—is available on the Internet. The priorities, however, are not around that way. We are dealing here basically with sexually explicit material. It should be getting far greater analysis and input from the Australian people than it is getting in the truncated, politically expedient program that we are dealing with here today.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>4744</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, I will deal very briefly with the last contribution. I feel rather sorry for Senator Brown. He has missed the point completely. He is either following or leading some of the narrow-minded, unintelligent members of the media by constantly suggesting that certain interests are to get my vote on this, that or the other. I challenge him and any of those small-minded members of the media to point to one case where I have not dealt with a matter completely on its merits. I am getting sick and tired of that sort of approach. I ignore it now, but I do not ignore it when it comes from a colleague who should have more responsibility than some of the unintelligent—I was going to say `ratbag'—reporters around the place. Mind you, most of the media are not into that, but some of them are.</para></talk.start><para>If the government is trying to get my vote on this particular matter, it is really going about it the wrong way. I have for many years been interested in this particular subject, and I believe that other senators and other 
 members of parliament have also because it has been of concern to the people of Australia, particularly to parents. If enacted, this legislation will be an improvement on the current largely unregulated environment. Thus, I believe it does deserve the support of the parliament.</para><para>I do not stand here representing the commercial exploiters of the online industry—those who are trying to make a fast buck by the transmission of hardcore pornography and violence. That is what we are talking about here: those who are trying to exploit the online environment for their own purposes—that is, to make big bucks. I, and I believe others on the committee who are supporting this legislation, stand here for the ordinary people of Australia and, indeed, for the genuine online businesses.</para><para>The commercial online industry has for at least six years been aware of growing concerns within the community and in the parliament that an unregulated environment could be exploited by those transmitting extremely violent or pornographic material into Australian homes. It has done very little to address those concerns. However, the  Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  falls considerably short of recommendations made by the Senate committee and its predecessor. For example, the first recommendation of the committee in its November 1995 report was that it should be an offence to use a computer service to transmit, obtain possession of, demonstrate, advertise or request the transmission of material equivalent to RC, R and X categories. In essence, this was repeated in the committee's recommendation in June 1997.</para><para>The bill does not follow the recommendations with respect to either the content to be regulated or the method of regulation. The bill is designed to generally operate on the basis of industry codes or, in the absence thereof, standards, and on a complaints procedure to be supervised by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The question arises as to whether such a proven passive regulator as the ABA is the most appropriate institution to do this. Only time will tell.</para><para>An area which will need to come under close scrutiny is the ready accessibility of 
 graphically violent interactive online computer games. Available figures indicate their growing popularity amongst teenagers, children and young adults, and I believe that is a matter which is of considerable concern around the community. It cannot reasonably be denied that Internet service providers and Internet content hosts and creators have an obligation to the end users of their services. In my view, these obligations should include, amongst other priorities, the right of users to be properly informed as to content labelling and to the identification and removal of unsolicited mail. They are also entitled to expect technical standards of excellence and properly accredited filtering technologies, including within the carriage infrastructure. It may well be that Internet service providers should be licensed and that licence conditions should apply. That is not in this legislation, but surely, unless there is proper cooperation from the industry with this legislation, the only answer is to impose licence fees and sufficient fees which will enable the matter to be carried forward.</para><para>Issues of privacy are of very special interest to our committee, and last year the committee conducted a number of hearings on the issue of privacy. It was assisted by the views expressed and information provided by the industry and by users. The draft report from Senator Jeannie Ferris, our distinguished chairperson, is now being considered.</para><para>Finally, parents should not be lulled into a sense of false security by the passage of this bill. Clearly, parents and others responsible for children will need to exercise vigilance and be empowered to do so through a massive education campaign and free technological support. This, in conjunction with an effective regulatory environment when it comes, will ultimately ensure an environment in which computer use will grow and exploitation diminish.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4746</page.no><id.no>r703</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r667</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4746</page.no><id.no>r666</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r702</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r699</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX TRANSITION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r698</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS NUMBER) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r664</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS NUMBER CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r660</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (END OF SALES TAX) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r658</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (PERSONAL INCOME TAX CUTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r657</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r701</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r663</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r659</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (AGED CARE COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r700</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r661</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r754</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r761</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r765</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r763</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r764</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r757</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r760</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r758</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r759</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INDIRECT TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r756</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (WINE EQUALISATION TAX AND LUXURY CAR TAX TRANSITION) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r762</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>4746</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline ref="r703">A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</inline></para><para>Consideration resumed from 30 April and 21 April.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering amendments Nos 6 and 7 on sheet FA209, moved by Senator Kemp.

I have a question to the 
 minister. Minister, we were concerned with the issues of gambling and casinos. There has been a great deal of press and media coverage, as you know, of this issue. It will be helpful for us all if you re-explained some of the fundamental principles that you have been spelling out with the gambling and lottery amendments.</para></talk.start><para>The starting point for all of us is the document you have referred to several times: <inline font-style="italic">Tax reform: not a new tax, a new tax system</inline>, the ANTS document, on page 98. I will go through it all the way, so that you can understand our problem with it. In that document, you state:</para><para>Gambling and lottery activities will be included in the tax base.</para><para>That is very proper.</para><para>The GST will apply to the operator's margin of these activities, not to the prizes paid out.</para><para>The operator's margin, as I understand it, is the gross value or the gross margin of all transactions for the reporting period—in other words, not an individual transaction, as it would be at a supermarket checkout. In the case of the gambling casinos area, it is all the transactions for the reporting period. You then go on to say:</para><para>That is, the tax will apply to the difference between total `ticket sales' or bets taken by the operator of the gambling or lottery activity and the value of the prizes or winnings paid out.</para><para>That in retailing is often referred to as a net margin. It is gross take versus payouts, and you have net margin before costs. You then state:</para><para>However, operators cannot always adjust their prices because these are often set by the rules of the game or by State government legislation relating to levels of pay-out. As the States already tax gambling highly there may need to be corresponding reductions in State gambling taxes.</para><para>That is the next point. I think you have made it clear in your public announcements that it is the states which will individually and at their discretion take decisions in these matters. In other words, there is not a Commonwealth agreement with them on this issue, as there is in other areas. If I have misunderstood you, I would like you to come back on that one. You go on:</para><para>This will be possible because, under the proposed arrangements, the States will receive the proceeds of the GST, including the GST on gambling.</para><para>It is when we move to the issue at hand, which is the issue of high rollers and how their transactions will be dealt with, that we get into some difficulty. Returning to the first proposition—that is, that all transactions will be counted to arrive at the net margin—that means that, if you take 100 gamblers on the bottom floor of the casino and they are playing Keno, roulette, blackjack or whatever other gambling games there are, on each of those games there is a different margin. Minister, are you happy for me to continue?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4747</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could I made a brief comment in order to assist the debate? Thank you for your courtesy, Senator Murray. I have noted the questions that you have put down. The amendment before the chair is on no tax invoices for gambling supplies. Last week there was a great deal of public interest in this, but I think that what you are referring to actually refers to another amendment which has been moved in relation to gambling and which will come on later.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me that, in order to speed the journey—and I am not seeking to avoid the debate; in fact we have all had a lot of debate on this issue, and you have raised some points which I am happy to respond to—probably it is time to return to the amendment which is truly before the chair and discuss that particular amendment. When we get on to this issue on the margin and your concerns about high rollers, that is actually applicable to a different amendment. The amendment we are dealing with relates to tax invoices.</para><para>I would suggest to the chamber that it would probably help order the debate if we dealt with these matters in an appropriate sequence. Last week, because there was a degree of enthusiasm about it, I recognised that interest and the debate was allowed to continue. But now I would ask the Senate chamber, because we have a great journey to run with these amendments, and it seems more appropriate, Acting Deputy Chairman Watson, if we could essentially try to confine ourselves to the amendment before the chair. 
 The matters which you wish to explore can easily be raised under the appropriate amendment—which, as I said, comes later on down the running sheet.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4748</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What I am seeking to do here, Minister, is to affect the climate in which all the gambling amendments will be reviewed. I am really continuing from the previous debate. The reason I do that is that if we can clearly understand the government's thinking with respect to the way in which these transactions are dealt with, I think it therefore enables what you would probably describe as relatively technically amendments in 6 and 7 to be dealt with within an understanding of the overall framework. So with the discretion of the chair—and I have just one question to complete my introduction—I would look for the indulgence of the Senate and the committee in terms of what has already preceded us to settle down some of these issues. That is my motive. If the chair is content with that, I will continue on that basis.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>4748</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No-one questions your motive or goodwill in seeking to do this.

As I said, I think these are separate issues.</para></talk.start><para>We are dealing now with tax invoices. It is my preference that we deal with amendments in order. What I do not want to do is have a debate now on the so-called high-roller issue, which takes up another swag of time, then get to the amendment this actually applies to and then run the whole debate again. We have been in this chamber now for about 35 hours and we are rushing towards a record debate on a bill. It is pretty clear that we will exceed all other bills. I think we have to get a procedure in place. The public expects us to deal with this in a sensible fashion.</para><para>I am not resisting the questions, but my experience and your experience in this will always be that answers lead to further questions and suddenly we have absorbed another swag of time which does not relate specifical 
 ly to the somewhat technical amendment which is now before the chair. It was a courtesy that was extended last week. We all recognised that this was an issue that there was some public interest in, so the debate was allowed to run fairly free and wide. Having recognised that and then having gone into an estimates process where there was another very extensive debate, we should deal with this at the time when it is appropriate to deal with it under the appropriate amendment which has caused concern to you and some others.

It seems to me that the government is proposing dealing with customers of casinos differently according to the class of the customer. What I mean by that, in a straightforward approach to tax, is that the government—if I understand them correctly, which is why I asked the question—have grouped all the customers together as one class of transactions to arrive at the net margin. But when dealing with the high roller it seems to me that they are proposing dealing with each individual transaction.</para></talk.start><para>If I can draw the distinction with the supermarket, it would be equivalent to dealing with each person coming through the supermarket below $100 individually and then everybody above $100 you might be dealing with together. If I misunderstand the government, then I need to know so, because what I am seeking is that the same method by which customers of casinos are to be dealt with in tax terms applies regardless of the amount of money being bet. I think I fully understand the grouping provision of the ANTS proposal whereby you take, as I gave the example, 100 
 betting patrons together and you arrive at their net margin, regardless of the fact that that margin may differ because one is playing blackjack, one is playing keno and one is playing roulette. It is the overall take less the payout which means the net margin, but my understanding of the high-roller approach is that each individual transaction is to be dealt with so that this high-roller patron playing blackjack will be dealt with on his own and that high-roller patron playing some other game of chance will in turn be dealt with on their own. That is the straightforward taxation principle I want to be reassured on with respect to these and every other subsequent gambling amendment. That is why I bring it up now: because it is relevant, I think, to the way in which these amendments are to be judged.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>4749</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me make it clear that the government is not distinguishing between classes of gamblers. The rebates will be taken off the gross gambling margin and the casino will calculate only one gambling margin for its operations for a particular period. So I think your concern was that somehow this was going to treat high rollers in a different fashion. As I said, we need to work out what is the actual proper margin, and the proper margin is one which is less rebates which are paid. We can get into this in detail in the debate on the amendment which will be moved later.

I repeat what the state government said:</para><para>But in the balancing that takes place to make sure that the states have their revenues protected, we do not foresee any problems. 
</para><para>That would suggest that they will not make an adjustment—that there will be no diminution to state revenues. The point of view—I will not describe it as a principle; I think that is a terrible notion—that the federal government has accepted from the Casino Association, when it lobbied the government to include these amendments, is not shared at state level by the West Australian state government.</para><para>I understood you to say, and I would have to check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, that this was a matter of a federal-state agreement and that you assumed or you presumed that if it was not done at federal level it would be done at state level. I take this opportunity to draw your attention to it, Minister, because when we come to the high-roller amendments I will have a series of questions for you on that matter, and I do not want you to be caught unawares. They will be serious questions and we will be intent on pursuing serious answers to them when we get to that point.</para><para>I will proceed now to the amendments that are before the chair at the moment. One of those is government amendment No. 7—the seventh of 128 amendments to your own legislation, Minister, on the GST. Amendment No. 7 says:</para><para>. . . after clause 126-32, insert:</para><para>126-33 Tax invoices are not required for gambling supplies</para><para>(1) You are not required to issue a *tax invoice for a *taxable supply that you make that is solely a *gambling supply.</para><para>(2) This section has effect despite section 29-70 (which is about the requirement to issue tax invoices).</para><para>The government is proposing, should we assent, to insert those provisions into the bill at this stage. I understand how the government intends to apply a GST to gambling—that is, a GST is applied to the margin. The losses of the patrons of a casino are regarded as sales by the casino for that purpose, and you deduct the losses by the casino against the losses by the patrons to get the net advantage to the casino and then tax that.</para><para>Here we have a provision referring to tax invoices. If I am a $10 pokie player and I lose $10 on the pokies, an invoice will not be 
 issued to me. Under this law, it would be technically a sale worth $10 by the casino. I have lost it but, technically, it would be a sale by the casino of $10. How will you keep track of what the casinos are rebating high rollers under this provision for an invoice? Because the way it operates—I think this is a settled matter between us; it is not a disputed matter—is that a high roller, defined as someone who gambles $500,000 to $5 million a throw, gambles at whatever game of chance they choose. Where they win, they take their winnings and run. Where they lose, in order to keep their custom—presumably, so that they can win more—the casino rebates them part of their losses. Say they are flipping half a million dollars on a game of chance and they lose, that for tax purposes is regarded as a half-million-dollar sale for the casino and is taxed.</para><para>But where the casino then rebates them $300,000 to soften the blow and encourage them to keep coming back, that means the sale by the casino, the actual loss borne by the high roller, is $200,000, not $500,000 as was wagered. If you are not issuing each of those high rollers with an invoice, as in that case—it is a similar question now to Senator Murray's—how would you keep track of what the amount of rebate is that casinos are giving to high rollers and whether the government is in a position to make a social judgment about whether the level of the rebate is fair, given that it applies only to people in this category and not to anyone else?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Or whether it is true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I take that interjection from Senator Murray, because it is to the point: whether the level of rebate is reported accurately and truthfully.

To extend that question one step further, how will we in this parliament, and through us the people of Australia, know what amount of money could have been collected in tax because of the GST but was forgone by the government in recognising the practice of casinos to rebate high rollers in the manner in which they apparently do?</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4751</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, let me say that you have flagged a number of questions that you want to pursue with us when we get onto the so-called high-roller amendments.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—What would you call them?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—They are not high-roller amendments; they are not designed to give any concession to high rollers.

The point I would make, however, is that the states have signed on to an intergovernmental agreement by which, among other things, they are required to take into account, when setting their taxes, the amount of money which is raised by the GST. There is an intergovernmental agreement, to which Mr Court was a signatory, based on the assumption that there would be no revenue collected on gambling higher than the current arrangements so that, as the GST is imposed, there will be an adjustment in state taxes. I think that is now broadly accepted in this chamber. I will look at exactly what he said. You asked me for some background, and there is an intergovernmental agreement which Premier Court has signed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The next issue you raised was the issue that Senator Murray was concerned about: separate invoices. The point I make there is that the casino will calculate only one gambling margin for its operations in a particular period of time. I think you understood me to say that, and you were quite correct if that was your understanding. The purpose of an invoice is to allow the recipient of a service to get an input tax credit. That is the purpose of an invoice. There are no input tax credits for gambling, so you would be issuing a bit of paper which really has no particular purpose, because you cannot get an input tax credit for it. Because of the way this was drafted, we 
 need to bring that clarity in. I do not think you are seeking an input tax credit for gambling, and it follows from that that you would also support our position that you do not issue an invoice, because the fact of the matter is that there is not an input tax credit and the purpose of issuing an invoice is for someone to get one.</para><para>You asked me how we can verify this issue. The casino, of course, will need to have records of their net margin. Similar arrangements are required under income tax law. Their records must be proper records, and the tax office has various powers to check that appropriate records have been kept. In a sense, it is similar to the current state arrangements. There is a comparative element there to the current state arrangements on the sorts of records which must be kept. They are subject, above all, to the normal audit requirements. I do not think there is anything that we are proposing here that is without precedent, but it recognises how the Income Tax Act works, it recognises that people have got to keep proper records and it recognises that they can be subject to audit. This is not anything which is strikingly new, but it clearly builds on the current system. As I said, because all the taxes on gambling at present are state taxes, essentially there are procedures in place to make sure that proper records are kept.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>4751</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—So, as I understand that answer, to the extent that we will be able to see transparently through the paperwork to identify the level of high-roller rebate that is being paid by a casino, we will be able to see only the global amount; we will not be able to see particular casinos or particular players. We will not, for example, know whether a high roller who is a resident of Australia will get a lower rebate—because they are more likely to patronise that casino—than a high roller who is, say, a wealthy Asian business person who might be playing the casinos of Paris or London and whom the casinos want to attract to play in their high-roller room. We will not know whether that particular class of 
 high roller gets a bigger rebate; we will not be able to differentiate about this.</para></talk.start><para>My point is that, because there will be no invoice per high roller, we will not know whether the rebates are standard to all comers in the high-roller room, differentiated to particular customers or different between casinos. It seems to me you could not identify that without an invoice, so to what level of transparency will we be able to go? On your other remarks: of course this is a debate that we will be having later, but it seems to me that, if Premier Court does not proceed in the way in which he has now indicated, the proceeds from the GST that you are providing to the state will be less or you will be cutting special purpose grants. But that is a matter for later on.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>4752</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Also with regard to item 7: Minister, would you indicate whether your amendment means that a casino must not or may not provide an invoice?

The reason we do not want to issue an invoice is that there is no input tax credit for it. We are not proposing to provide individuals with an input tax credit on this issue so we would not issue them with a GST invoice. In other words, this would be inconsistent with all the other invoices where people can claim an input tax credit. This would not be a matter where we would want to issue one simply because there is no input tax credit available.</para></talk.start><para>I imagine that a casino could issue a receipt or anything else that it wanted to. If an individual wanted some records, I suppose that it is a matter for the casino to provide some records to the individual if he wanted them for his own purposes. But it would not be an invoice of the type which is defined in the legislation and would not have the same standing as an invoice which is defined in the legislation, because there is not an input tax credit for that person. So, if you are worried about whether the person has records, presum 
 ably he can negotiate with the casino as to what sort of receipt or anything else is appropriate.</para><para>In relation to your comments, Senator Cook, I have to say I am probably like you: I do not go to casinos, I do not gamble and I have no particular knowledge in detail of how casinos operate—but we can always seek information for you if it is germane to the argument that we are running here. The level of rebates at present is a matter for the casinos. You indicate that they may offer different rebates. I can always check that, but you have made that point. If you are correct, that is exactly what happens at present, and of course at present there is no wholesale sales tax on gambling or whatever. So the truth of the matter is that it is simply a matter for the commercial decision, I would have thought, of the casinos as to how they operate. They have to run their own business and they work out what rebates may be offered.</para><para>You suggested they may offer lower rebates to Australians and higher rebates to people from overseas. My point there is that this is essentially a matter for the casinos. It is a commercial decision, one which they make at present, presumably. To the extent that your argument applies in the future, it presumably applies right now. What we are going to be doing, as distinct from the current arrangements, will be to impose a GST on the gambling margin. I would have thought that would have given you some comfort.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>4752</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, yes, of course we understand that there are no input credits available from gambling.

It is relatively common practice for businesses to entertain visitors, customers or suppliers in casinos. You can picture the scenario of the sales manager of, say, an auto parts company being told by his boss to take three visiting suppliers to the casino.

 boss would expect him to come back with a receipt saying that he spent $1,000 on chips.

There may be other areas that are more regulated, but this would arguably be one of the most regulated sections of the economy. Subsection 126-10 of the bill makes it clear that a global GST amount is calculated for one tax period and rebates will be one element used to calculate the single global GST amount. I hope that provides some additional comfort.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Murray was worried whether the gambler could get some record. My answer to that is that it is a matter between the gambler and the casino, but he will not get, as a result of this amendment, an invoice of the type defined in this bill and on which an input tax credit would be available.</para><para>In relation to Senator Cook's concerns, much of what Senator Cook raises—if it is accurate, and I have no reason to argue that; I have no special knowledge on this—occurs right now without a GST on the gambling 
 margin. Where there are varying rebates offered, as Senator Cook has asserted—again I have no specific knowledge—then that presumably occurs now.</para><para>Then there is the issue of how you deal with proper records and I pointed out again that it is regulated. Proper records are required to be kept by the Australian Taxation Office, which has audit arrangements. I gave further comfort by suggesting that this was already a very highly regulated section of the economy, particularly where states are concerned and the taxes are imposed by state governments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>4753</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, you are getting there, but you have not quite satisfied me and it is for this reason: at no time and in no sense should an Australian ever have to negotiate with a supplier a receipt or an invoice. I mean it for this purpose: every customer is entitled to have a receipt for payment. We must not even imply in this debate that it is an option for a casino not to supply a receipt if asked for it. If, in the example I gave you, the sales manager was given $1,000 by his boss to buy gambling chips, his boss would want to know that those $1,000 were spent on gambling chips. In customer law it is the right of every customer, whether going into a garage, a supermarket or a chemist, to make whatever kind of transaction and to demand and get an invoice for their own record keeping purposes. I am not suggesting for the purposes of generating a tax exemption. It is not a negotiation, it is a right that attaches to the customer.	 I presume you do not gainsay that right and your use of the word `negotiation' was a loose explanation.

 As I said, I have no particular knowledge of that, but this does not alter that arrangement.

The division operates so that the GST is paid as the payments occur, not in one lump sum with the first payment. These amendments will improve the operation of the division, making it clear that supplies such as leases are subject to GST as the lease payments are received by the lessor.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4755</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before going to the amendment, you took the opportunity, Minister, to advise the chamber that you will be releasing further amendments to the luxury car set of bills which comes within this broad ANTS package and that you are doing so as a consequence of the Senate select committee report.

 Senator, I have not ruled out other amendments, as you would be aware.

So there is no change in intent and when you look at the amendments, they make sense. I know Senator Cook is opposed to a GST, but in the context of bringing in broad based tax reform, I think people will look closely at what the original intent was.

Frankly, I am at a loss to see that it advances understanding from a tax practitioner's point of view. It strikes me as almost unnecessary. But I assume it is not, so I do not have any objection. I clearly understand your example of how a lease is to be dealt with, but it has been brought to my attention, and probably to the government's, that some business people would like to be able to move between tax reporting periods within a 12-month cycle. This is the kind of flexibility that people such 
 as farmers want—when they are expending large lump sums they would rather be in a very short reporting period so they can get the input credit immediately and when they move to a normal operation they would like to change their reporting period, and so on.</para></talk.start><para>So my question relates to flexibility. Does the opportunity exist within the clauses dealing with progressive or periodic supplies and acquisitions for people such as farmers to move about within a 12-month period using different reporting periods and different reporting methods to suit their particular business needs? Or do you elect to operate within only one kind of reporting cycle every 12 months? That is my understanding of the legislation at present. I wonder whether this change you have put up signals a different approach or policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4757</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No, Senator.

The length of the tax periods that an individual or business may report on, and whether it be monthly, quarterly or whatever, is a different issue.

 input credit in a short time frame. We see a mixing of the two problems of periodic payments and the reporting period when a transaction is spaced over a period of years. The example you gave was of a one-time payment, say, by a farmer for a combined harvester, but it often does not happen like that.

But I do not think the case is one which is of relevance to Australia.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>4760</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish that was more comforting than it really ends up being. We realise that in recent times the states have come to agreements about such things as high-rolling gamblers without any real knowledge or without it having been part of the original agreement, and that seems to have covered the government in changing their GST package. Has the government done any research or studies attempting to quantify the compliance costs for recipients, the Australian Taxation 
 Office and government departments in subjecting certain grants to the GST system? Has any calculation been done of the cost of the administrative ping-pong of this system of working out whether a person is subject and sending it back if they were not or paying them more on a certain calculated amount and sending it back?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>4760</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Margetts, I think we are probably discussing your amendment now rather than mine.

Leaving aside that editorialising, this is an important program. If someone from that program gets a grant of, say, $100,000, they are then obliged to undertake the research and development that was in their proposal, but they will get a grant of $110,000 in order to meet the GST requirements on that grant. Where does the extra $10,000 come from? Does it come from the global allocation to that program or are all programs to be topped up by 10 per cent so that the real value of those programs remains constant?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>4760</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As economists used to say, on the assumption of ceteris paribus—all other things remaining the same—the cost to the government or the particular department is the same because the department gets a credit where there is a GST component.

As you know, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>  has been upgraded and rejigged.

The first issue it did not give a source for; the second issue is from the Parliamentary Library's paper of last week; and the third is a quite well-known legal expert.

 Minister. Through the chair, to assist the Minister, I am probably more interested in what the definition would exclude rather than include. I would like to know if it excluded ASIC or the ACCC—those kind of autonomous institutions—and how it would deal with Telstra, which is part owned and part not, government business enterprises and those sorts of things, if I could.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment before us, as Senator Margetts has outlined, does pick up issues concerning how community organisations, who fulfil what were government functions, will compare with this. As the minister would probably be aware, community groups like St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, Centacare and Unicare are all reporting big increases in demands for services, as funding to core government services is cut back. In other words, there has been a cost shifting from the government sector to the not-for-profit sector.</para><para>The issue, if I understood her correctly, that Senator Margetts was raising is that that is all very well but, if it also carries with it a further 10 per cent tax imposition, that gets even harder to deal with. I appreciate that, in the way that you have responded so far, you have sought to allay those fears and I think I have understood your responses in those regards.</para><para>But there are also other areas, such as Job Network—which we might deal with tomorrow when the debate resumes—where the Prime Minister has a stated policy objective of privatising much of those functions in turn, which might be considered welfare or government functions. How will they be affected by the policy and the amendment and the provisions of the bill that you have already covered? I flag that question mark to you.</para><para>I clearly understand from what you have said that, if a payment is made to a government agency for a service under an appropriation, it is GST free. That would seem to be eminently sensible. I cannot see why you would not want to do it. But, as Senator Margetts has picked out, if it is made to a community service organisation, an environmental organisation, a public health organisation or a not-for-profit employment provider, 
 it could in certain circumstances be subject to GST—and that would create major problems. If those problems are passable, I think we need to attend to how they could be avoided.</para><para>I should indicate that it is not our intention to oppose this amendment, but we will move our own amendment later on to make grant payments to charities GST free, so that it is absolutely clear that that is the situation.

Next year the government forecasts economic growth at 3 per cent—this is faster than most of the major economies of the world but a little slower than the very high growth of 4¼ per cent this year. Our current account deficit—widened by weak export prices and a strong consumer demand for imports—is forecast at 5¼ per cent of GDP. This is a little better than this year. But it means we cannot afford to be complacent.</para><para>The world economy is still a very uncertain place.</para><para>Just as the economic reform of three years ago gave us the strength to ride out the challenges of the last year, the reforms of today will determine how we ride out the challenges of tomorrow.

We cannot with certainty, 
 predict the work skills they will need for the jobs they will do—but we do know that the best possible way to prepare them is a strong education.</para><para>The Commonwealth, in this forthcoming year, will spend $4.8 billion on the education of primary and secondary children. The government is committed to ensure that all young people have access to a strong basic education and a quality pathway from school to further training, further education, and employment. A key government priority is to ensure that every Australian school child is able to read and write. This budget builds on previous initiatives by allocating $131 million over four years for literacy and numeracy programs in schools. For the first time, literacy and numeracy programs will extend to the middle years of schooling. Parents want their children to be able to read and write. We want to help schools do it. Funding of $78 million is being provided for a Quality Teacher Program to help teachers focus on professional development in literacy, numeracy, mathematics, science, information technology and vocational education.</para><para>Additional funding of $553 million over five years has been provided for Catholic systemic schools, implementing our election commitment made last October. This decision followed an independent assessment of the needs of this system conducted by the Non-Government Schools Funding Review Committee.</para><para>In this budget we are announcing a new formula for distributing recurrent funding to non-government schools. The new system will be based on the needs of the parents, taking into account the resources of the community that a school serves. It will provide a fairer and better treatment. It will boost funding for needy schools. The new system will be phased in to operate fully by 2004. Schools which could have been disadvantaged by the new arrangements will be protected. They will have their existing per capita grants adjusted in line with cost rises. This guarantee and the increased grants going to more needy schools will increase funding by around $561 million over the 2001-04 school quadrennium.</para><para>Madam President, if we are to educate our children for life, we must also educate them about the evils in our society.</para><para>The government rejects the inevitability of increasing damage to individuals and the community from illicit drugs. To date the government has committed to a range of new measures in the fight against drugs, as part of the National Illicit Drug Strategy. In this budget $80 million over four years is announced for interception, treatment and a National School Drug Education Strategy: to teach our children the dangers, and hopefully protect them from the scourge of illicit drugs. This budget also provides a further $221 million over four years to allow police to compulsorily divert illicit drug users from the criminal justice system to counselling and treatment. We do not accept that drug addiction cannot be treated. This budget provides funds to expand treatment services for drug users.</para><para>A Safer Community</para><para>The government will establish a National Crime Information System (Crimtrac) to build a National DNA Criminal Intelligence Database and a National Child Sex Offender Database. Crimtrac will provide access to the most up to date and efficient technology to store and retrieve information to help police stop crime and protect the public. The government will also be establishing a National Crime Prevention Program aimed at finding and promoting ways of preventing crime and violence in the community. To enhance an equitable and accessible system of federal law and justice, additional counselling and mediation dispute resolution services will be provided and access to justice for disadvantaged people in rural and regional areas will be extended. The Commonwealth will establish a new Federal Magistrates Service to deal with less complex Federal cases. A Commonwealth Law Courts building will be constructed in Adelaide.</para><para>Families</para><para>Madam President, the government has before the Parliament legislation to provide 
 around $2½ billion of extra family assistance each year.</para><para>Associated with the introduction of the new tax system from 1 July next year, over two million Australian families will qualify for additional assistance—at least $140 per child, and in a one income family with a dependent child under five, $490 per child.</para><para>This is in addition to income tax cuts now contained in legislation before the Senate. The government's legislation proposes to cut income tax for every Australian taxpayer.</para><para>In addition to the increased benefits provided to families as part of the government's tax reform—A New Tax System—from 1 July 2000, eligibility for Family Tax Benefit, Part A will be extended further than is contained in the legislation. The benefit will be payable for dependent young people up to the age of 21 years who are not receiving Youth Allowance, or if they are receiving part Youth Allowance, the benefit will be topped up for qualifying families to the maximum rate of $37.50 per fortnight.</para><para>The government's focus on helping families includes a range of specific initiatives including increased relationship support services, assistance to resolve family disputes, developing approaches to reduce domestic violence, expansion of children's contact services, a new suicide prevention strategy and support for carers of young people with disabilities. The government will implement a new youth homelessness early intervention program and provide increased funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program which provides transitional support and accommodation to help homeless people and those at risk from domestic violence.</para><para>The government's economic strategy is directed squarely at helping Australian families. The average Australian family with a mortgage is saving over $320 a month as a result of interest rate falls under this government. More young Australians can buy homes. More families can pay the mortgage to keep their home. Good economic policy is good family policy.</para><para>Health</para><para>The government is working to improve the health and medical care of all Australians. We are committed to a balanced health system with Medicare, a strong public hospital system and the opportunity for more Australians to take out private health insurance.</para><para>We are working with the States and Territories to ensure continued improvement in the efficiency and quality of services in public hospitals. To encourage private health insurance, from 1 January this year, every Australian taking out private health insurance is eligible to have 30 per cent of the premium paid by the Commonwealth.</para><para>To build on this initiative, and to further encourage people to take out health insurance, Lifetime Health Cover will be implemented from 1 July 1999. This system will allow registered health funds to charge different premiums, depending on the age at which a person first joined a health fund. People taking out cover early in life will pay lower premiums. The new system rewards early and continuous membership. The premium will be set at the age a person first joined, and once set, remains at a lower rate, relative to people entering at an older age. We want young people to make health insurance a habit. There will be a 12 month grace period from 1 July to allow those not yet insured to do so. If they do, they will be credited with the lowest possible joining age. In addition, special provisions will protect people aged 65 or more on 1 July 1999 by ensuring that they can take out hospital cover at any time and be credited with the minimum joining age.</para><para>In this, the International Year of the Older Person, the health care of older Australians is a particular priority. The budget provides funding of $228 million for an Enhanced Primary Care Package, targeted to older Australians and those with chronic conditions. The package is designed to better coordinate health services and to improve people's self-reliance and capacity to manage their own conditions. For example, the government will provide for voluntary annual health assessments for those Australians aged 75 and over. We will put in place a program to help prevent injuries to elderly people arising from 
 falls. Separately, $82 million has been provided to expand the provision of respite care for carers of people with dementia and other cognitive and behavioural problems. These measures are designed to support carers and by supporting them, to support those with disability.</para><para>The government will provide additional funding of $210 million over the next four years for hearing rehabilitation services, including the provision of hearing aids for eligible persons. The funding will enable a further 67,000 Australians to be assisted each year. While this will mainly benefit older Australians, a component of this funding will be directed towards the ongoing delivery of high quality hearing services to children and others with special needs.</para><para>The government will continue to work toward addressing the huge disparity in the health of our indigenous people. Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander primary health care funding is to be increased by $79 million over four years. The Army/ATSIC Community Assistance Program which provides environmental and health infrastructure delivered by defence personnel to indigenous communities will also be extended.</para><para>Rural and Regional Australia</para><para>The government is strongly committed to rural and regional Australia. We know the many challenges that country people face. So tonight, in this budget, there are a number of initiatives seeking to help strengthen the social and economic fabric of rural and regional areas.</para><para>We are working with Australia's primary industries to secure their profitability, sustainability and competitiveness. Part of this is the ongoing Supermarket to Asia Strategy to develop Australia as the food supplier to the region. To add to this, a new Food and Fibre Supply Chain Program will be established. These programs will open up markets for Australia's farmers. Resources are also being provided for the Northern Australian Quarantine Strategy and regional flood mitigation programs. The government will provide $32 million over five years to restore ground water pressure in the Great Artesian 
 Basin, a major water resource for the country, supporting pastoral and mining enterprises.</para><para>People living outside capital cities must have access to quality health care. During the 1998 election campaign, the government committed itself to a series of measures to improve rural health services in the short and longer term. This budget delivers on those promises. An additional 30 Regional Health Service Centres will be established in rural communities across Australia over the next four years. These centres will draw together health, aged care and other community services to a central location; based on community need, providing a mix of services to best meet local priorities.</para><para>And we know rural Australia needs more doctors. The government will spend $43 million over four years to pay retention money for long serving GPs as an incentive for them to continue practice in rural and remote areas. The government will establish a clinical school based in Wagga and a medical school at James Cook University in Queensland. We will establish a Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarships Scheme for rural students to train as doctors. Rural people trained as doctors are more likely to serve in rural Australia. We will establish a fly-in female general practitioner service for women in rural and remote areas who currently do not have access to a female GP.</para><para>To ensure that students from rural and regional areas have access to education, this budget provides a number of initiatives including increasing boarding allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme and extending eligibility for the student financial loan supplement.</para><para>Two new Centrelink call centres will be established, in Maryborough in Queensland and Port Augusta in South Australia. The new call centres will tailor services to customers in regional and rural Australia.</para><para>As part of the social bonus to be funded from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra, the government will fund the establishment of up to 500 rural transactions centres at a cost of $70 million over five years. This means small rural communities can establish centres 
 that provide access to services, such as banking, post, phone, fax and Medicare from the one centre. This goes a long way to defeating the distance that makes it hard for rural and regional Australians to access services.</para><para>An efficient and integrated transport sector is vital to underpinning economic growth, creating investment and providing services to people in both urban and regional Australia.</para><para>The government has allocated an additional $195 million over four years to upgrade the National Highway System and roads of national importance. Increased funding is also being provided for bridge upgrades to facilitate the introduction of increased mass limits for heavy vehicles. These programs will enhance the efficiency of our road transport system, with consequential national and regional economic benefits. The Black Spot Program is also being extended for a further two years in order to make our roads safer and reduce the social trauma and human costs of road crashes.</para><para>Training and Employment</para><para>Madam President, one of the most significant structural changes introduced by this government was the concept of mutual obligation—the obligation of the community to the individual, and the obligation of the individual, in return, to the community.</para><para>That is why the government introduced the Work for the Dole scheme. It has been immensely successful.</para><para>The government is pursuing a wide range of labour market reforms to achieve sustained reductions in the level of unemployment. As part of an integrated approach to employment, the scope of activities that satisfy the mutual obligations of unemployment beneficiary recipients will be increased. Work for the Dole will be extended to those aged between 25 and 34 years who have been in receipt of unemployment payments for twelve months or more. Work for the Dole will also be expanded to Year 12 school-leavers in receipt of unemployment payments for more than three months. In total, this will involve a doubling of Work for the Dole places from 25,000 in 1998-99 to 50,000 by 2000-01.</para><para>Employers in rural and regional areas will be provided with an additional incentive payment of $1000 to progress new apprentices to higher skill levels in trades and occupations experiencing skill shortages.</para><para>To combat the severe employment problems faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the government will introduce the Indigenous Employment Policy. The package of additional initiatives to address the severe employment situation faced by indigenous Australians will double the funding for indigenous program initiatives from $25 million to $50 million per annum.</para><para>Frontiers in Science and Research</para><para>Madam President, advances in health care and quality of life in the future will come from new knowledge and new scientific breakthroughs. Australia has a proud history of science and medical research. Australian pioneers—the Howard Floreys, the Macfarlane Burnets, the Victor Changs—led the world. We want to build a culture that will bring forth new pioneers in the new century, who will expand the frontiers of knowledge and advance just like their predecessors.</para><para>In an historic commitment, the government has decided to invest an additional $614 million over the next six years into health and medical research funded through the National Health and Medical Research Council. No previous Australian government has ever given health and medical research such a high priority.</para><para>This will more than double the Council's existing funding level by the year 2005. A significant part of this investment will be for the development of an enhanced national medical genomics capacity, which will have the potential to look for ways to cure major illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. This capacity, along with other research initiatives the Treasurer is announcing tonight, will ensure that Australia can maintain its place at the cutting edge of biotechnology. This is a new frontier for innovative, knowledge-based industries in health, agriculture and many other related areas. Most importantly, this funding will enable our best and brightest to pursue opportunities in 
 science and medicine, here in Australia. In addition, new funding of $20 million over the next two years will develop enhanced physical facilities in Australia's leading health and medical research institutes.</para><para>This significant boost in funding for health and medical research flows, in part, from the recommendations of the Wills Review, the most comprehensive report ever undertaken into medical research. These measures will consolidate Australia's position in the top 10 OECD countries in terms of health and medical research investment.</para><para>Biotechnology will have a major impact on many commercial activities and has the potential to improve the lives of Australians through new medical treatments, safer and more nutritious food, reductions in the use of chemicals and more sustainable land use practices. We are going to assist the biotechnology industry to maximise its contribution to the Australian economy. This will be done through a one-stop-shop named Biotechnology Australia, supported by a Council of Ministers, to advance developments and harness discoveries in this area. The government will also establish the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, operating with existing mechanisms to ensure Australia has a nationally consistent system to regulate food, agriculture and therapeutic goods to develop public confidence and ensure public safety in reaping benefits from this cutting edge area of science.</para><para>To help ensure that Australia maintains its strength in scientific and industrial research and innovation, the government will maintain higher baseline funding for the CSIRO. Research infrastructure funding for universities will be increased and new science lectureships will be established. This complements the Strategic Partnerships-Industry Research and Training program for which additional funding has previously been announced.</para><para>Leading Financial Services</para><para>Australia's system of financial regulation leads the world. The stability shown in the banking and corporate sector, notwithstanding the Asian financial crisis, is evidence of how well placed the regulatory reforms have 
 proved. To enhance Australia's capacity to participate fully in the strong global growth in the financial services industry, the government has allocated $3.5 million in each of 1999-2000 and 2000-01 for initiatives to promote Australia as a centre for global financial services.</para><para>Australia's public finances are reported and presented on a world class basis. Our Charter of budget Honesty is now advocated internationally as a model for other countries. This budget is presented on an accrual basis for the first time. It allows us to properly budget for future expenditures. This puts Australia at the forefront of transparency in the conduct of fiscal policy.</para><para>Economic Outlook</para><para>Madam President, after two years of economic growth in excess of 4 per cent, growth of around 3 per cent is expected in 1999-2000. Growth over the year to the June quarter 2000 is expected to be around 3½ per cent. This is a remarkable achievement given the crisis in Asia and the slowdown in world growth. Economic growth in Australia will remain stronger than all the G7 economies and the average of the OECD countries and more favourable than most countries in the region.</para><para>In 1999-2000 we are expecting stronger growth in both exports and investment in plant and equipment as the international economy gradually improves.</para><para>Employment growth is set to be strong enough to keep intact the very significant gains this government has made on reducing the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate should remain around its current level. The outlook is for inflation to remain low, averaging 2 per cent in 1999-2000.</para><para>As exports and commodity prices respond to a gradual strengthening in world growth, the current account deficit will ease in 1999-2000 to average around 5¼ per cent of GDP.</para><para>Concluding Comments</para><para>Within the space of four budgets the coalition has positioned Australia for the next century. We now have very sound fundamen 
 tals: strong growth, low inflation, the budget in surplus and the prospect of completely eliminating Commonwealth net debt.</para><para>Our next budget will begin the story of the 21st century. By then we should have a new tax system—A New Tax System for the new century. A new tax system will fund and sustain our hopes and aspirations in health care, in education, in care for the old, and care for the young.</para><para>The next decade could be a special one for Australia—a step up in growth, in jobs, in our community infrastructure, in our services, for those in need, in our living standards, leading the region and, in many respects, leading the world.</para><para>Good economic policy will determine our capacity to meet these important social objectives. This is a budget for those objectives. This is a budget right for these times.</para><para>I commend the budget to the Senate.

He suggests he may want to leave; that is fine. I rise tonight to discuss the issue of the labelling of genetically modified organisms. It is timely, and I congratulate the government for the idea in the budget that we will see the establishment of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, which is a positive move in terms of recognising the importance of genetic technology issues to Australians. However, I wish to address the developing issue of genetically modified organisms and their labelling. It is a pressing concern of the Australian and international communities and it must be addressed by this parliament. It has serious implications for health, environmental trade and consumer rights to information.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Recently, genetically modified organisms have been recognised internationally to possess unknown health effects. In February this year the government of the United Kingdom declared an open ended moratorium on commercial production of genetically modified crops until such time as the government can be assured that they do not damage the health of consumers and the environment. The food minister, Mr Jeff Rooker, also announced earlier this month the introduction of new regulations requiring restaurants and cafes to inform customers of foods which contain GMOs. This extends European rules requiring retailers to label all foods that are GMOs—beyond the supermarket shelves to the hospitality industry.</para><para>The UK announcement also follows moves by Marks and Spencer to cease sales of foods containing GM ingredients and the supermarket chain Sainsbury's plans to eliminate GM ingredients from its own brand products—at present all but 50 products contain GM soy protein or DNA and these are labelled. Such international initiatives demonstrate that it is possible and cost efficient to identify GM ingredients in food and further more that it is actually in the interests of the industry to do so.</para><para>Such moves are long overdue in this country. A national government study by the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology determined, as long ago as July 1995, that 89 per cent—a huge majority—of Australian consumers supported the labelling of genetically engineered tomatoes. Only four per cent said they were against labelling.</para><para>At present, the majority of processed foods in Australia contain soy beans imported from the US of which 15 per cent are genetically modified and unlabelled. This is a real concern. Without labelling, consumers are unable to avoid those foods which may cause allergic reactions or conflict with ethical or religious considerations. This is not going to be resolved under the current ANZFA proposed A18 standard. The authority only requires labelling of GMOs which are not substantially equivalent to its conventional counterpart. However, `substantially equivalent' is too broad and does not adequately ensure consumer health.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—This will make front-page headlines tomorrow.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Tests used to determine substantial equivalents do not detect unstable or multiple inserts of genes into an organism's genome, which could have unknown health and environmental effects. I am sorry that some senators opposite do not consider this kind of information important or exciting to them, but 89 per cent of consumers, when asked about genetically modified tomatoes, do think it is of concern. I am sorry that Senator Abetz is now on record as suggesting that it is not exactly front-page news.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Furthermore, tests for some kind of allergic reaction as stipulated by ANZFA cannot test for new proteins that may be produced through genetic manipulation processes, or new combinations of toxins that could cause allergic reactions. On this basis the A18 standard is deemed inadequate and, therefore, should be rejected. This was one of the findings of Australia's first consensus convention on the issue of genetic technologies.</para><para>The final report produced by the convention strongly recommended that all GM foods—not just those which are not `substantially equivalent'—should be labelled. The report overwhelmingly rejected the term `substantial equivalence' due to its narrow scientific application, and it promoted very strongly the idea of comprehensive labelling as the only way to ensure that individuals have full control of the health, religious, moral and ethical aspects of genetic engineering. I call on the Senate to recognise that and endorse the final report that the convention produced. I think it is one of the most comprehensive accounts to date of the Australian public's views on genetic technology and, in particular, GMOs.</para><para>Among its recommendations the report called for a new statutory authority with transparent procedures to hold responsibility for GMOs. That is why I sought to acknowledge the government's positive aspects in tonight's budget, despite the interjections by government members. I was actually commending them on something that they have done. I suggest that the people who were responsible for the report at the consensus convention will see that some of the ideas proposed in tonight's budget may go some way to alleviating concerns.</para><para>A further recommendation in the report was that environmental and health departments be integrally and proactively involved in developing strategies to address GMO applications. That is yet to happen. Another recommendation was that the regulation of GMO issues not be moved to the agricultural, fisheries and forestry portfolios or departments. We have heard whispers behind the scene that we could see a transfer of the responsibility for issues 
 such as this from health portfolios, where they belong, to agricultural portfolios.</para><para>If we are not mindful of environmental and health concerns and do not regulate comprehensively, we will lose consumer confidence and significant trade opportunities. According to a 1997 poll, 70 to 90 per cent of Japanese are in favour of comprehensive labelling of GM products. In light of this, we should be promoting ourselves as a clean and green exporter, rather than undermining our current trade advantage, as I believe the A18 standard will.</para><para>At present, Australia is the only country to guarantee non-GM canola. In January this year, the largest shipment of Australian canola to leave our shores was sold to oilseed crushing plants in Europe. Europe has become a major buyer of Australian canola due to our GMO-free canola supply. The 57,000 tonne shipment, valued at around $A26 million, is expected to lead a record shipping program for 1999 which is to total approximately 350,000 to 400,000 tonnes.</para><para>The importation of Australian GMO-free rapeseeds by the Japan Agriculture Co-op Association is another example of the potential trade benefits for a country such as ours if we are into comprehensive identification, preservation and tracking regulations. Australian trade with the association commenced in October last year and is expected to expand to 20,000 tonnes per year as consumer demand increases. By implementing a strong identity preservation regime in Australia, we can position ourselves as a clean, green exporter in the Australasian region and exploit our natural advantage as an isolated land mass, an ideal attribute to quarantine against genetic pollution.</para><para>At present, the Australasian health food company Sanitarium has installed a rigorous system which ensures that their soy milk is GMO free. This system guards against cross-contamination of, say, United States GM-free seeds through the export, production and manufacturing processes—to use the expression that ads use, from paddock to plate. The Sanitarium system demonstrates that identity tracking and preservation is actually possible and is advantageous to Australia's trade 
 position. We should be promoting our own clean, green soya in Australia, guaranteed by comprehensive identity tracking and preservation. These are things that most consumers involved in the genetic technology debate, certainly the consensus convention, have called for.</para><para>Australia needs clearly stated, compulsive guidelines. We need legislated rules regulating the use of GMOs and ensuring personal health, the health of our environment and our agricultural trade relations. We must reject ANZFA's standards for labelling and implement a real comprehensive and workable system, not a system like the A18 standard which pretends to label GMOs.</para><para>Finally, I would like to acknowledge the money that has been put forward tonight for some of the biotechnology advances, but warn that we still have no framework legislation in this country to guard against discrimination on the grounds of genetic information and nothing that actually protects genetic privacy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Why didn't you appear at the hearings?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I look forward to the day when the government introduces a legislative regime on a state or federal level, a bit like the US is debating right now.

Consultancies under $100,000 are not required to be subject to tender process. However, depending on the value, at least three 
 quotations are required from selected suppliers before the consultancies are decided. For further control the approval of consultancy expenditure is restricted to the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Managers as follows: Board  $250,000; Chief Executive Officer  $250,000; Executive and General Managers  $50,000.</para><para>No established list of preferred companies is used due to the diverse needs and wide scope of consultancies used. Where a confined enquiry is used, these have to be approved by the appropriate authority depending on the value of the consultancy as outlined above.</para><para>The details for Airservices tenders over $100,000 have been provided to the Table Office.</para><para>CASA: CASA's procurement policy requires all procurement of goods or services over $100,000 to be provided through a formal tender process.

There have been no material variations to contracted cost.</para><para>CASA: The practice of varying the cost of a consultancy is an exception rather than a rule and can occur for a number of reasons which may result in a net increase or decrease to the contracted cost of the services. Where such variations occur, an amendment to the consultancy agreement would be required. In considering a variation, CASA officers must have regard to the Authority's stated procurement policy including value for money open and effective competition. A list of consultancies for the period considered that includes the actual cost of each has been provided to the Table Office. 
</para><para>BASI: The contracted cost for the consultancy was 16,800 English Pounds. There was no variation to this cost.</para><para>DoTRS: The contracted cost was $32,200. The actual cost was $46,202. The variation was due to payment of allowances for travel, accommodation and other incidental costs.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Airspace Trials: Additional Fuel</title><page.no>4776</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 185)</subtitle><id.no>185</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4776</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 24 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Were notices to airmen (notams) issued in the early days of the trial of the Class G airspace arrangements requiring aircraft to carry holding fuel due to air traffic control (ATC) delays; if so: (a) when were these notams issued; and (b) why were they issued.</para><para>(2) Would this additional holding fuel apply to high flying aircraft in controlled airspace being controlled by controllers looking after the Class G trial airspace as well.</para><para>(3) Did this additional fuel load impose a penalty on these aircraft in terms of revenue payload uplifted.</para><para>(4) Would this requirement cost the airlines money even though their aircraft were not involved in the trial.</para><para>(5) Does the Government intend to compensate the airlines for these additional costs.</para><para>(6) What are the criteria against which the success or otherwise of the Class G airspace will be measured.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4776</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Yes.</para><para>(a) Thursday 22 October 1998.</para><para>(b) As a contingency against possible workload from the Class G demonstration, in accordance with the provisions in the Southern District Safety Case.</para><para>(2) Yes.</para><para>(3)-(4) This data is not available to the Transport and Regional Services portfolio.</para><para>(5) No.</para><para>(6) Had the Demonstration continued, its success would have been assessed against the objectives as stated in the Airspace 2000 Program Definition Plan.

 traffic movement rates to set the hours of operation; and (b) can details of these formula or criteria be provided.</para><para>(10) (a) Is it a fact that, in the case of Bankstown airport, Airservices Australia is considering a proposal to reduce the air traffic control tower operating hours to eight a day; (b) what is the reason for this proposed reduction; and (c) if it is costs versus income, then what is the cause of the reduction in Airservices Australia's income at Bankstown.</para><para>(11) Rather than looking at aircraft movements per hour as the criteria for establishing the proposed new tower operating hours, is it a fact that Airservices Australia determined that the income at Bankstown was only sufficient to pay for 8 hours a day, and that Airservices Australia then put this to the aircraft operators at Bankstown and advised that if they wanted more than 8 hours a day, they would have to pay the full costs for providing those additional hours.</para><para>(12) (a) Is it a fact that the safety case Airservices Australia prepared to justify that it is safe to reduce tower operating hours determined that any more than 50 movements an hour was less than safe in a mandatory broadcast zone than if the control tower was operating; and (b) how was the rate of 50 movements an hour determined.</para><para>(13) Is it a fact that outside the proposed new Bankstown tower operating hours, there were frequently more than 50 movements an hour, making the area around Bankstown less safe and that, despite this, Airservices Australia's management was prepared to accept the risk; if so, on what basis was this decision made.</para><para>(14) Has Airservices Australia given any consideration to the fact that movements at Bankstown may increase outside tower operating hours due to it being cheaper to operate when the tower is not operating.</para><para>(15) What consultation has Airservices Australia undertaken with local residents and councils in the area around Bankstown regarding the proposed reduced tower operating hours.</para><para>(16) What is Airservices Australia's position in regards to the provisions of air traffic control services at locations where the income is insufficient to cover the costs of providing air traffic control services, for example, will Airservices Australia be cross-subsidising the provision of services at low income producing locations from other high income producing activities, or will Airservices Australia be pursuing government funding as a community service obligation.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4782</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided

As part of the post implementation review of the changes at Moorabbin Airport, a flight monitoring program is being conducted by Airservices. This monitoring commenced on 13 March and will continue until 11 April 1999.</para><para>(d) Nil since the monitoring program commenced 13 March 1999.</para><para>(7) The pilot of the aircraft that caused the special procedure to be breached would be liable for that breach.</para><para>(8) (a) Airservices Australia advises that the reason for reducing the hours was to more closely align the hours during which an air traffic service is provided with current traffic demand.</para><para>(b) Airservices advises that it conducted a workshop on hazard identification and risk assessment relating to the proposed new air traffic arrangements. The recommendations arising from the workshop were addressed by Airservices 
 management and documented in the Airservices' safety case.</para><para>(c) Yes. Airservices has advised that it will make available the relevant safety documents to the Senator's office.</para><para>(d) As advised above, Airservices is currently monitoring aircraft movements outside the tower hours of operation, and is ready to make alterations to arrangements where experience shows safety or customers require such changes. Already since the new arrangements were introduced and as part of the ongoing monitoring processes, Airservices has modified the hours of operation to better serve the pattern of traffic demand.</para><para>(9) (a) No. I am advised by Airservices that changes to tower operating hours are only made after a detailed analytical process to ensure safety is not compromised.</para><para>(b) See (a) above.</para><para>(10) (a) No. However, in response to a proposal put to Airservices by users at Bankstown Airport, options for reducing tower hours were considered.</para><para>(b) See (a) above.</para><para>(c) See (a) above.</para><para>(11) No.</para><para>(12) (a) No. The Bankstown proposal for reduced hours of operations did not proceed.</para><para>(b) As part of the safety case prepared to assess the proposal put to Airservices by users at Bankstown Airport, the rate of 50 movements per hour was an initial input. However in the case of Moorabbin Airport, development of the safety case demonstrated that a rate of up to 100 movements per hour (that is, 50 circuits per hour) was consistent with long established procedures for aircraft operations at Moorabbin outside the current hours of air traffic control coverage.</para><para>(13) Airservices confirms that the rejected proposal for Bankstown Airport included consideration of tower hours that would have frequently resulted in more than 50 movements per hour outside the proposed tower hours.</para><para>(14) Yes.</para><para>(15) The proposal for reducing hours at Bankstown was not progressed to a stage where wide consultation was appropriate.</para><para>(16) In recognition of the potential impact of Airservices' move to location specific charges and the potential for this to adversely affect some businesses at locations with relatively low levels of traffic, the Government is providing $13m over two

The introduction of accrual accounting, along with other improvements in financial management, has been recognised as a priority of financial management units of the Department and will be met within existing work plans. 
</para><para>(3) (a) and (b) During 1997-98, the Department of Transport and Regional Services began implementation of a new, SAP R/3-based, financial management information system to facilitate the introduction of improved financial management information and processes.

The Department has not prepared any forecast of estimated expenditure during 1998-99 to prepare for the move to accrual accounting next financial year. This, along with other improvements in financial management, has been recognised as a priority of financial management units of the Department and will be met within existing work plans.</para><para>(b) The total costs of consultants employed, in both 1997-98 and 1998-99, for preparing to move to accrual accounting next financial year is outlined in the answer for question 4.</para><para>(6) See the answer to question 5(a) and (b) in relation to the cost of consultants engaged in relation to preparation for the introduction of

 Initiative is the most important recent initiative to reduce the external debt of HIPC countries to sustainable levels. Moreover, it is the most credible way of achieving long-term debt sustainability. The Government agrees that this, in turn, assists human and social development. Unsustainable debt has increasingly been recognised as a constraint on the ability of poor countries to pursue sustainable development and alleviate poverty.</para><para>(2) (a) The Government is a strong supporter of the HIPC Initiative which was introduced by the World Bank and IMF in 1996 to provide concerted and comprehensive debt relief to HIPC countries that have demonstrated a commitment to structural reform and sound economic policies. The HIPC Initiative reflects the view that debt relief without true adjustment would be wasted. To qualify for relief, a country must be eligible for concessional assistance from the IMF and World Bank, face an unsustainable debt burden beyond available debt-relief mechanisms such as the Paris Club, and establish a track-record of reform and sound policies through IMF and World bank-sponsored programs of up to six years. To date, the World Bank and IMF have agreed to extend assistance to seven countries and many more are expected to have relief packages in place by the year 2000. The Initiative has so far committed US$6.1 billion in debt relief. The Treasurer announced in June 1998 an Australian contribution of $30.5 million.</para><para>(2) (b) The Government's approach to poverty reduction and human development in our own region and worldwide was set out most recently in my Eighth Annual Statement to Parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program in December 1998 and, before that, in the seventh annual statement, Better Aid for a Better Future, tabled in parliament in November 1997. Those documents set out the framework for Australia's approach to development cooperation, including through an emphasis on the five sectors of health, agriculture and rural development, education, governance, and infrastructure. Australia's practical commitment was demonstrated through the allocation in 1998-99 of almost $1.5 billion in overseas aid to develop and implement development cooperation projects and programs in partnership with recipient countries.</para><para>(3) Of the 40 countries classified by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, three—Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Vietnam—have sovereign debts with Australia.</para><para>(4) The levels of debt owed to Australia as at 30 December 1998 from those countries classified as HIPCs are: Ethiopia ($15.3 million), Nicaragua ($5.7 million) and Vietnam ($67.6 million).</para><para>(5) The debt owed by Ethiopia is on an aid-related loan written in 1990-1991 under the former 
 Development Import Finance Facility for sugar cane milling equipment. The debt owed by Nicaragua is on a 1986 export credit loan for sugar cane harvesting equipment, provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). This debt was rescheduled in 1991. In negotiations at the Paris Club at that time, Australia extended the term to 25 years and agreed to a grace period of 14 years. As a result, the first instalment of principal on this debt is not due until 2007. Further, at a meeting of the Paris Club on 9 December 1998, all creditors agreed to defer all repayments of debt—including interest—owed by Nicaragua (and Honduras) until 2001, when there will be further discussion of the issue. The debt owed by Vietnam consists of 11 export credit loans provided by EFIC. The range of projects and products supported with these loans have included a fruit and vegetable processing plant, an abattoir, a coal processing plant, metallic telephone cabling, a sugar refining plant, sugar cane milling equipment and a digital automatic data processing machine.</para><para>(6) If Australia was to retire the bilateral sovereign debt of the three HIPC countries listed at (3) above, the extent to which debt was forgiven on a mutually agreed basis would impact on expected future Government revenues. The impact would occur over the debt amortisation period equivalent to the debt forgiven. The impact on the Australian economy would not be significant in overall macroeconomic terms.</para><para>The Government acknowledges the genuine motivation behind calls for debt cancellation by the Jubilee 2000 Coalition and others, but has reservations about Jubilee 2000 proposals for cancellation of all "unpayable" debts. Debt relief without the type of conditions imposed under the HIPC Initiative has the potential to shield governments from their responsibilities and may be seen as a reward for poor economic performance. In addition, relief such as that proposed by Jubilee 2000 could encourage further accumulation of unsustainable debt and discourage creditors. Debt in itself is not a "bad" thing as international flows of capital are essential for countries to grow; new loans are continually being taken out and thus there will never come a time when "the slate is wiped clean".</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Branfield, Mr Illych Marbuck</title><page.no>4795</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 605)</subtitle><id.no>605</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4795</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 22 March 1999.</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the recent suspected suicide death in London of an Aboriginal male, born in 1972 of Denis Walker and Cheryl Buchanan, and an interview given at the time by the paternal grandmother, Kath Walker (reprinted in various

Ms Buchanan maintains that she was contacted by Queensland's Children's Services Department immediately after her release but was refused details of Mr Branfield's location on the grounds that he had been adopted. However he was not actually adopted until 2 years later.</para><para>Ms Buchanan continued to approach the Childrens' Services Department and other government departments following the loss of her son seeking information on his whereabouts. She was assisted in her efforts by JIGSAW, a group who provided help to parents in tracing children that had been adopted.

He was finally located in 1996 in England by his maternal grandparents, Pondijyfljydu (Una Branfield) and Gnarnyarrhe Waitarie.</para><para>(5) ATSIC's decision was based on the claim by Ms Buchanan that her son was taken from her after his birth in 1972 and given away for adoption without her permission.

Two potential sites for the storage facilities were also identified during preliminary investigations. These sites are on State forest land, one off Hut Road and the other off Saltwater Creek Road. The optimum locations for the wharf and for the storage facility will be determined during the detailed technical investigations, including environmental assessment.

These planning guidelines have been applied during the concept design phase of the proposed wharf and land based storage facility at Twofold Bay.</para><para>Wharf: Location of the wharf such that the green line extends only over water means that, during transfer of ammunition at the wharf, the only incompatible activity is manned vessels anchoring within the green arc (transiting vessels are acceptable). Only personnel involved in the process would be permitted on the wharf when ammunition 
 transfers were in progress. There are no known current or planned incompatible activities within the wharf yellow and purple lines.</para><para>Storage Facility: Location of the storage facility within the state forest in areas not planned for future development would allow Defence to control (by lease or ownership) access and development out to the purple line. The main restriction would be within the green line, Defence would need to fence off land within the green line and no public access would be permitted within this area.</para><para>(7) The 30 tonne licence is sufficient for Navy's planned requirements without the need to raise a public risk waiver.</para><para>(8) The wharf would be available for commercial use when not required by Navy. If approved by Parliament, Defence's concept of operations for the wharf does not require Defence management of the facility providing that the management arrangements that are put in place with a commercial operator/port authority ensure Navy's operational priorities are met.</para><para>(a) Under such arrangements, Navy use would take priority within a forward planning framework that equitably provides for commercial users.</para><para>(b) Defence would not impose any specific constraints on commercial operations.</para><para>(c) Cost of construction of a wharf to meet Navy requirements will be fully funded from Defence appropriations; costs associated with infrastructure not required by Defence are the responsibility of commercial interests/State government.

Community consultation and public briefings were held on 17, 18 August 1998 and on 18, 19 February 1999. Community consultations were held with Bega Shire Council (August 1998 only) at shire chambers, Eden Aboriginal Land Council (both occasions) at its premises, and Harris Daishowa Australia (both occasions) at its premises. Public briefing sessions were held at the Eden Fisherman's Club on both occasions. Additionally, the then Minister for Defence, the Hon Ian MacLachlan AO, attended a public meeting on 16 September 1998 at the Eden Fisherman's Club. 
</para><para>(b)The PWC hearing was a public hearing with open invitation. The public briefings were also by open invitations.</para><para>(11) A open invitation was extended to the community. Information on attendees was not recorded; however, it is estimated that approximately 80 people attended the PWC hearing in April 1998, approximately 30 people attended the August 1998 and February 1999 briefings, and approximately 20 people attended the meeting in September 1998.</para><para>(12) The general public has been informed of the proposal through the PWC public hearing and the public briefings. There has also been considerable media coverage of the proposal: the local newspaper has given considerable coverage to the proposal and has run reports before and after the PWC hearing and the two public briefings; ABC radio also ran a number of interviews regarding the proposal. The proposal received considerable media coverage during the State election campaign.</para><para>(13) (a) Future public briefings would be held during the detailed development of the proposal.</para><para>(b) Meetings will be arranged in conjunction with the Bega Valley Shire Council and any proposed public meetings will be advised through the local press in advance of the meeting. Additionally, should the proposal proceed to the approval stage, the PWC will presumably conduct another public hearing.</para><para>(14) The assessment regime required for this proposal is not yet determined. Defence submitted a Notice of Intention to Environment Australia on 23 March 1999 in accordance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and expects that the Minister for the Environment will determine the environmental assessment regime required during April 1999.

In response the department stated that: `This expenditure was found to be outside the guidelines and has been repaid'. Given that this response not only failed to answer both the questions and answered a question that was not asked: (a) who was the ticket purchased for; (b) who authorised the ticket to be purchased; (c) what was the rationale for purchasing the ticket; (d) was the ticket purchased associated with embassy business or for private purposes; (e) in regard to (d), if for business, what was the nature of this business; (f) in regard to the repayment of the cost of the ticket, who made the repayment; (g) in regard to (f): (i) who requested that the repayment be made and (ii) why did that person request that the repayment be made; (h) (i) when did the Government first become aware of the repayment and (ii) who was made aware; (i) did the Minister seek any explanation for the repayment; if not, why not; and (j) what audit procedure exists to ensure that embassy expenditure is legitimate and not for private purposes. 
</para><para>(2) Various questions were placed on notice regarding Ambassador Peacock's membership of both the Washington City Club and the Maryland Jockey Club. The department was asked whether its decision to pay membership of both clubs fell within the guidelines set out in Administrative Circular 181/94. The department responded that membership of both clubs was `seen, in this case, as being reasonable'. Given that this did not address the question asked: (a) was the department's decision to pay membership of both clubs within the guidelines set out in Administrative Circular 181/94; and (b) in arriving at its decision that the membership of both clubs was `reasonable', what authority or guidelines did the department rely on.</para><para>(3) A question was placed on notice regarding Ambassador Spender's purchase of a `special dress shirt', and whether this contravened Administrative Circular 181/94, which states that "Morning dress tails and evening dress' are not admissible expenditure items. The department's response stated, in part, that: `The "evening dress" referred to in Administrative Circular 181/94, in fact refers to women's clothing; it does not preclude men's formal wear (other than dress tails) and would not preclude the purchase of a dress shirt.'; how does the Minister reconcile this statement with the Macquarie dictionary's definition of `evening dress' as `formal dress clothes'.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4800</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following response in answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) As advised in the Department's answers to Questions on Notice in Senate Estimates, it is not considered appropriate to release the names of private individuals; (b) The Australian Embassy Washington authorised the purchase of the ticket; (c) To be Guest of Honour at a luncheon at the Ambassador's residence for members of the Washington Press Corps; to co-host a dinner for guests at the residence, including a member of the Clinton Cabinet, a Chief White House correspondent and other prominent Americans; and to attend a major representational function at which the Ambassador was present; (d) Embassy business; (e) A function which raised funds for charitable causes; (f) Ambassador Peacock made the repayment; (g) (i) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; (ii) Because an examination of representation acquittals for Washington showed it to be an inappropriate claim; (h)(i) In the second week of February, 1999; (ii) Relevant officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; (i) The Minister was made aware of the repayment and was satisfied with the Department's decision on the matter; (j) All representation acquittals are subject to desk audit in Canberra during which process any

It had been accepted practice by posts, and the Department had agreed with this interpretation, that purchase of a certain amount of clothing for heads of mission was acceptable. It is accepted that there was a degree of ambiguity in the guidelines at the time, and for that reason they were amended in September 1998 at which time all provision for clothing was deleted.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Forest Management: Victoria</title><page.no>4800</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 623)</subtitle><id.no>623</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4800</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 March 1999:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 405 (Senate Hansard, 23 March 1999, p.2845), in which it was stated that, `The Victorian legislation underpinning the observance of sustained yield was central to the Commonwealth's accreditation of Victoria's systems and processes as providing for ecologically sustainable forest management (ESFM)' and that, `the Commonwealth and Victoria agree that Victorian systems and processes, including its legislation, policies, Codes, plans and management practices, provide for the sustainable management of forests':</para><para>(1) On what basis did the Commonwealth: (a) accredit Victoria's ESFM systems and processes as `satisfactory' when the Prime Minister has no information on the actual levels of sawlog removals compared with the legislated levels; and (b) consider illegal reclassification of sawlogs to be the responsibility of the Victorian Government.</para><para>(2) In accrediting Victoria's ESFM systems and processes, did the Commonwealth: (a) review the legislated levels of `sustainable' yield to ensure that they were in fact sustainable; (b) audit the actual level of logging to ensure that it was within the legislated sustainable yield; and (c) audit log classification procedures to ensure that downgrading from sawlogs to residual logs was not occurring.

In approaching these negotiations, the Government is not seeking to oppose any of the three technologies raised in the honourable senator's question.</para><para>Article 12 stipulates that the certification of emission reductions will be based on real, measurable and long term benefits related to the mitigation of climate change. Should projects involving any of these technologies be developed on this basis,</para><para></para><para>the Government considers that they should qualify for the allocation of emission credits under the CDM. To limit the generation of emission credits that might be derived from energy production sources to renewable energy—which is the upshot of opposing the three technologies raised in the question—would be quite unrealistic and would unnecessarily constrain the technology options available to developing countries in developing their energy sectors. Improving the efficiency with which fossil fuel based energy sources are used, for instance, can have definite climate change benefits and should be recognised as such.</para><para>The developmental aspirations of developing countries can not be realised by relying solely on currently available renewable energy technology. Even allowing for concerted global action to mitigate the effects of climate change, fossil fuels and nuclear energy will continue to play a major role in the global energy supply for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is no justification for excluding these energy sources from consideration under the CDM. Host countries will, of course, through their role in approving projects, be able to exercise discretionary control over which technology options they adopt.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Maritime Safety Authority: Search and Rescue Manual</title><page.no>4803</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 655)</subtitle><id.no>655</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4803</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 8 April 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Can a copy be provided of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) search and rescue manual that was in force on 1 December 1995.</para><para>(2) If there was no AMSA manual in force at that time did the authority work from the International Maritime Organisation search and rescue manual; if not: (a) what manual did AMSA work from or what procedures did AMSA follow as at 1 December 1995; and (b) can a copy be provided of that manual or those procedures.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4803</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) and (2) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's search and rescue operations are guided by the principles set out in the National Search and Rescue Manual.
