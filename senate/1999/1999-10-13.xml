</para><para>(2)	 That this resolution remain in force until either the document is tabled or until the last sitting day of 1999, whichever is earlier.</para><para>(3)	 That, as the first item of business on the Monday of each sitting week, the Minister be required to make a statement to the Senate outlining whether she is intending to comply with the order and, if not, outlining her reasons, and a motion may be moved without notice to take note of the Minister's statement.</para><para>This matter, as senators would be aware, relates to the failure of the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, to comply with an order of the Senate and table a discussion paper on welfare reform which was highlighted a number of times in the press prior to the minister's Press Club speech on 29 September as containing the government's blueprint for where they saw the future of welfare policy in this country. As senators would be aware, the minister changed her mind about providing the discussion paper at that time, allegedly under pressure from the Prime Minister. Instead, she proceeded with a speech which was a bit of a vision thing rather than an outline of concrete proposals. The only concrete proposal contained within it was to set up a reference group to develop a green paper for the government for consideration by cabinet, to see the light of day somewhere around the middle of next year.</para><para>The Senate supported the motion that I moved for that discussion paper to be tabled in this chamber and to be made public. From my point of view, and without speaking for the rationale of all other senators, I believed it was important that, if we were to have a public debate on the future of welfare policy in this countryâsomething that the Democrats certainly believe is importantâwe should do it from a fully informed position and should have a clear idea of what the government's thinking is. Obviously a discussion paper doesn't require the government to be locked into the proposals contained within it, but it gives clearer parameters for the public and the Senate to consider the future directions in which welfare policy may go in this country.</para><para>The minister has chosen not to table the paper. Her rationale in her statement yesterday was basically that she was still developing it and would provide it to the Senate when she provided it to the reference group at some time down the track. The minister may indicate in her contribution today as to when that may be. From the point of view of the Democrats that isn't adequate, for two reasons. The broader reasons I will go to in some detail. Firstly, there is the need to respect the powers and responsibility of the Senate when a return to order is made for a particular document to be tabled. It is a measure that the Senate uses from time to time to enable public scrutiny of documents that the Senate believes it is appropriate to be made public. It is not something that is done lightly and it is not something that should be ignored by ministers, except for extremely good reasons.</para><para>The second component in some ways gives me greater concern. The motion before the chamber today talks about the minister failing to comply with the return to order and proposals to censure the minister for that contempt of the Senate's return to order. The minister's statement yesterday gave an indication that she was still completing the paper, was still working on the paper, and therefore couldn't table it because it was not finished yet. That was the first time that I have ever heard an indication that somehow or other this paper was a work in progress rather than a finished document. The minister, I am sure, will elaborate on this in further detail. Certainly prior to the minister's Press Club speech at the end of September there was a widespread expectation that a discussion paper would be provided. She chose not to do that at the time, which is her choice and, one would suspect, a political choice. It was her choice not to proceed with it.</para><para>Certainly there was a widespread indication that the discussion paper had been finished and was ready to be provided then. It wasn't so much a matter of, `We cannot provide it at the Press Club because it is not finished', but `We have chosen not to go down that path and will now give it to the reference group instead.' To now suggest that it is a work in 
 progress is a disconcerting suggestionâif that is what is being suggested by the minister as one of the reasons why it can't be tabled. If a paper is finally provided to the Senate one would have to suspect that the original discussion paper is being rewritten and that what we may end up getting is not what the original return to order relates to but some other modified, sanitised version.</para><para>I hope the minister does not go down that path, firstly, because it would mean providing the Senate with a document that is not what is actually the subject of the return to order and, secondly, it would fail to end the speculation that the government has a hidden agenda. Obviously it is up to the government to decide their own strategyâI am sure they are not interested in gratuitous advice from meâbut I think it would be far better to have the full discussion paper on the table so that the government and the minister would not be subject to scare campaigns about what may or may not be in the discussion paper and about what the hidden agenda may or may not be. We could see what the agenda was and the government could justify it and debate it in a full and robust way, in the same way as all of us have to justify and debate our positions on all policy, including welfare policy, in a robust way. I certainly encourage the government to go down that path.</para><para>Moving away from the issue of welfare policy to the specific motion before the chamber to censure the minister and require her to table the document by 3 p.m. on 18 October and then going through some suggested actions if that is not done, to some extent it is worth going over the history of returns to order in this chamberâwhat the practice has been and what the views of the Senate have been. Obviously, each time a minister chooses not to comply with a return to order, it is a matter for the Senate to decide whether it accepts the reasons put forward by the minister. That is part of what this motion is about loosely. From my point of view and the Democrats' point of view, we do not accept the reasons put forward by the minister.</para><para>It is worth emphasising that it is not particularly common for ministers not to comply 
 with returns to order. According to statistics in the latest edition of <inline font-style="italic">Odgers Senate Practice</inline>âalways a good read, which I recommend all senators have a look atâin the last term of the previous government 53 returns to order were made and only four were not complied with. In the first term of the current government, from 1996 to 1998, 48 returns to order were made and only five were not complied with. Usually refusal to comply has been based on some variation of the argument that to produce the document would not be in the public interest. The most popular reasons put forward have been matters such as commercial-in-confidence, excessive and inappropriate use of departmental resources where a large number of documents have been requestedâthat is obviously not the case in this particular circumstanceâthat somehow the documents are sub judice or relate to legal professional privilege or they are a matter of cabinet confidentiality. Clearly, on all the evidence to date, none of those factors apply to this document. As I stated previously, the rationale put forward by the minister as to why it is not appropriate to table it seems to me to be incredibly flimsy.</para><para>In the past when returns to order have not been complied with the Senate has considered what action to take. Occasionally it has accepted the reasons put forward by the relevant minister or the government, if they were along the lines of the reasons I just outlined. Sometimes the Senate has not chosen to accept the reasons put forward by the minister. Without going through a full history of the Senate's responses to such circumstances, it is worth highlighting a few cases to put it in context. I see in the press this morning that a spokesperson for the minister has labelled this censure motion a stunt. I certainly do not see it as a stunt. I see it as an important matter of emphasising the rights of the Senate in the parliament for appropriate scrutiny of the executive in terms of what the executive is considering doing. It has a long history stretching right back to the origins of the Senate at the start of this century. It is an important power of the Senate which is not exercised lightly. When ministers choose not to comply with it, it is something that should be viewed seriously 
 and the reasons given considered in great detail.</para><para>To give a few examples of previous occasions when ministers have chosen not to comply with a return to order, back in 1982 there was a refusal by the government to produce documents connected with tax avoidance and evasion on the ground that to do so would be harmful to the administration of justice. That matter had not been resolved by the time the 1983 election came along and the government changed. In 1991, the Senate agreed to an order requiring the government to table a tape recording of conversations between a minister and representative conservation groups. The leader of the government subsequently tabled a letter stating that the government would not table the tape recording but attached an extract from a transcript of the recording. On that particular occasion, the Senate censured the government for its refusal to table that tape.</para><para>In 1992, the government refused to produce documents in response to an order for the production of a note on a Treasury file and indicated that producing it might damage Australia's relationships with other countries. I do not think that is something that applies in this case. In 1993, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, was ordered to produce a letter by a minister relating to woodchip export licences. Senator Evans declined to produce that on the grounds of confidentiality and the Senate chose to censure him at that time for this refusal. I would suggest again that cabinet confidentiality and commercial confidentiality are much more serious reasons for not tabling something than the one that has been put forward by the minister to date.</para><para>The Senate has constantly indicated its displeasure with failures to comply with returns to order except on serious grounds and a number of times has censured ministers for their failure to comply. This year, as senators would probably recall, the current Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, was censured for not responding properly to an order for documents relating to the Jabiluka uranium mine, where the minister tabled some documents and listed others which were 
 withheld on stated grounds but subsequently stated that he had only produced key documents rather than all documents. Again, the Senate deemed that that was not a satisfactory response and censured the minister.</para><para>So it is not just a matter of some stunt; it is a matter of ensuring that the Senate highlights the importance of returns to order. In a sense, it moves beyond what I believe is an important policy issue of welfare reform. I would hope to see us discussing that issue in detail rather than matters such as this, ideally, but it moves beyond that to the issue of the duties, responsibilities and powers of the Senate, as against the executive of the day, and the requirement of the executive to respect the role and the powers of the parliament.</para><para>The second component of the motion, beyond the censure and requiring the minister to table the document by 3 p.m. on 18 October, is to introduce some measures if the minister continues to fail to respect the order of the Senate. From the Democrats' point of view, this is, I believe, an important component. The measures that are contained in paragraph (b) of the motion, which basically seek to prevent a motion put by the minister from being voted on until the document has been tabled, are shamelessly plagiarised from a contingent notice of motion put forward by the then oppositionâI think by Senator Ian Campbellâin 1994 at a time when the then Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, refused to table documents relating to Casselden Place and the rental rates there. He gave a contingent notice of motion which would have had an identical effect to part of what is contained in the motion before us today, which was to prevent that minister being able to have any item of business voted on. I have gone to that as precedent, if you like. Whilst the coalition at that time gave a contingent notice of motion that it might move to prevent a motion by the minister being voted on, it never actually acted on that contingent notice of motion. What I seek to do with this motion is to put that in place, rather than leave the sword danglingâto actually wield the sword, in a gentle and non-violent way, of courseâby ensuring that there is some follow-on action by the Senate if the minister 
 fails to comply with the continuing order of the Senate.</para><para>I think this is particularly important because one of the unfortunate components of censure motions over time has beenâwhilst I personally believe they are important and I know the Democrats have always considered them seriously before we have decided to vote for them and have not always voted in favour of censure motions that have been put forwardâthat they have been portrayed, basically, as a slap on the wrist. That has certainly been suggested to me by the media that have spoken to me about this in the last 24 hours. I do not see it as a slap on the wrist: I see it as an important statement by the Senate, but I do acknowledge that unless there is some follow-up action it does not have any practical effect. What this motion also seeks to do is to ensure that there is some practical effect in relation to the censure motion and the minister's ongoing failure to comply with the return to order.</para><para>Senators would be aware that in recent times the New South Wales upper house has exercised its powers fairly strongly in relation to a minister that refused to table documents. In fact, on a number of occasions it has chosen to eject the Treasurer of the government of New South Wales from the chamber because of his refusal to comply. So in that sense I would see the proposal put forward in my motion as being rather more mild than what the state parliament in New South Wales has chosen to do. It appears clear to me that the Senate has the power to do this. As the New South Wales upper house has shown, it is important, when ministers refuse to comply with directions of a chamber, to follow through with some form of action to ensure that it is not just perceived as some slap on the wrist or indeed some badge of honour for a minister to be censured. What I have attempted to do in the second part of the motion is to ensure that there is follow-on actionâthat if the Senate believes that it is a serious issue that the minister has chosen not to comply with a return to order that we express that, not just by passing a motion of censure but by coupling it with concrete action which has some impact on the minister.</para><para>I have noted comments in the newspaper today by the opposition spokesperson in this area, Mr Wayne Swan, from the lower house indicating that, whilst the Labor Party may have some uncertainty about components of what is being proposed in the second part of the motion, they are not going to go soft on the minister: they are keen to ensure that she does not get off lightly, if you like, for this particular contempt of the Senate. I hope that the opposition, the Labor Party, in the Senate will follow through on the words of their spokesperson, Mr Swan, and ensure that there is some teeth to this censure motion. If they have some concerns about the specifics of what is being proposed, I am sure they will express those, but hopefully they will put forward some other alternatives which will at least have some impact in terms of ensuring that it is not just a motion without any practical effect but that it does have some follow-on impact as a way of ensuring that the displeasure of the Senate is clearly indicated.</para><para>Whilst there has been a long history of returns to order and a much shorter history, although not a totally uncommon history, of ministers refusing to comply with them, there have been censure motions that have been passed. As far as I am aware, there have not been other components coupled with those motions which have had practical effect. I believe it is time that the Senate moved to that stage on these issues. It seems fairly pointless passing returns to order and requiring ministers to table various documents unless we follow through with some sort of action in the event of a minister failing to comply without adequate reason. In this case, on the evidence available to date, I do not believe the minister has given an adequate reason, by any stretch of the imagination, and that is why I believe the motion is important. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>9529</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Newman's three-year record as Minister for Social Security and then as Minister for Family and Community Services is a very sorry record indeed. The implementation of Centrelink has been a shambolic mess. Last week's Ombudsman's report 
 underlines that. The Ombudsman found that Centrelink often failed to give clients enough information about their entitlements and then was prevented by law from backdating payments when mistakes were made. He correctly recommended social security laws be changed to allow Centrelink to backdate payments for up to 12 months when people had not received the amounts to which they were entitled. But this is years too late. The previous Ombudsman, Ms Philippa Smith, had similar criticisms in earlier reports. Senator Newman should have been managing all of this a lot better, a lot sooner and a lot earlier than she was.</para></talk.start><para>But ministerial mismanagement of Centrelink is just a very small part of the picture with Senator Newman. Senator Newman is the minister who in the first term of the Howard government allowed the destruction of the Commonwealth dental scheme, cuts to child care, the introduction of fees for home and community care programs such as Meals on Wheelsâin fact, cuts to almost a billion dollars of welfare assistance.</para><para>She, along with other ministers in the government, has slashed funds to those in the community who are dissenting voices, particularly in the community sector, including only last week the Girl Guidesâof all peopleâbecause they had the hide to criticise the GST during the Senate committee process. There was the defunding of the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, AYPAC, and National Shelter. All these decisions symbolise this minister's fear of criticism and the proactive approach this minister has to smothering dissent in her portfolio area.</para><para>On 1 October, Senator Newman removed funding from more community groupsâgroups which represent the interests of Australian women and their families. Groups caught up in the reprisals here were the Women's Electoral Lobby, which copped a $50,000 cut. The National Women's Justice Coalition, the National Women's Media Centre and the Women's Action Alliance all copped a $25,000 cut. That is the sort of thing that Senator Newman has been on about, as senators know.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âSenator Faulkner, I hesitate to interrupt, but I draw your attention to the motion.

These are the same groups that have raised concerns over the past 12 months about the harsh impacts of the GST and have challenged the direction of government policy for women. I am making the point that this is typical of Senator Newman; this is typical of this minister. To make things worse, Senator Newman now refuses to make public her blueprintâher earth-shattering position paperâfor national welfare reform, the blueprint on which her address to the National Press Club was supposed to be based. It is a pattern. She does it all the time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For example, the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 29 August received the good oil from Senator Newman's minders. Her position paper was `to focus on the mutual obligations that recipients have for payments'. It was going to outline Senator Newman's policy to arrest the increase in the number of disability pensioners. On 8 September, a media advisory was posted in the gallery which touted the forthcoming speech. It stated that it would launch `an agenda setting discussion paper on welfare'. The speech was to be given on 21 September. But Senator Newman came unstuck. Somewhere between 8 and 10 September the Prime Minister, John Howard, and his gatekeepers read the speech and discussion paper and they went ballistic. A correction was posted in the gallery. It read:</para><para>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the seminal address, The Future of Welfare in the 21st Century by Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Jocelyn Newman, will be delivered at the National Press Club on Wednesday, 29 September rather than Tuesday, 21 September.</para><para>The launch of the discussion paper was canned by John Howard and the government. The speech was delayed. There was a hasty 
 rewrite of the speech; all the ugly bits were taken out and we were left with a blancmange. I read the AAP report on 27 September. It was hilarious. It read:</para><para>The Federal Government today went into damage control over reports that it was preparing to slash its welfare program targeting sole parents and disabled pensioners . . . Measures reportedly being considered include forcing single parents to look for work when their children turn 12, extending work for the dole to over-35s and drastically tightening Disability Support Pension rules. But Mr Howard, anxious to underpin his family-friendly credentials, promised the speech would not contain specific measures regarding individual income support . . . Senator Newman appeared to backtrack, playing down the significance of the speech as opposition senators claimed she had been rolled by the prime minister amid fears of a voter backlash.</para><para>That is the truth of the matter. On 29 September, Senator Newman promised a blueprint. The blueprint became a meandering speech which outlined the social problems that everyone knows all post-industrial globalised economies face. She announced the formation of a reference group, announced the Chair, Mr McClure, announced a green paper and finally announced a timetable. This reference group was now tasked to set the agenda, not Senator Newman. What a humiliating backdown from Senator Newman.</para><para>Back in Senator Newman's office, there abandoned on the desk is the discussion paperâthe much publicised discussion paperâwith the i's dotted and the t's crossed. The press gallery and welfare groups were all salivating for the detail of this discussion paper, but what did we get? The last refuge of a cornered ministerânothing. There is a proposed green paper and a timetable. She did not even have the terms of reference organised, it was such a fiasco.</para><para>In the pitiful excuse we heard from Senator Newman in the Senate yesterday for the non-production of this `agenda setting' discussion paper, she said that she regretted she was not in a position to give any discussion paper. She said it was still being developed as the government submission to the reference group and it will be completed shortly. In other words, she now claims she is writing the discussion paper that was advertised. That is 
 apparently going to be part of this hastily organised green paper exercise. No-one would believe that.</para><para>The first question that begs an answer in this place is: if it was ready to be unveiled at the Press Club, how come you are still writing it? Staff were priming us all for the great vision for Australian welfare in the new millennium. Now the vision is being revised and revisited. What we got from Senator Newman again yesterday in the Senate was a smokescreenâa weak explanation, a deliberate mislead and a cover-up. We know that a humiliating gag was applied to Senator Newman by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, just before her so-called seminal speech. What was the reason? The proposal was so politically unpalatable that even the Prime Minister could not cop it and it required more careful management.</para><para>I think everyone understands that this is the way this government does business. We have come to expect this from the government. It is part and parcel of the way the Howard government operates: gagging everyone, silencing the critics, a lack of provision of information to the public, and the devious ways in which accountability and scrutiny in this parliament and in the public arena are ignored. I was pleased about that editorial earlier in the week in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, which pointed out, quite rightly:</para><para>. . . political opportunism perpetuates a damaging cycle of mistrust of politicians by the public. This mistrust is a cancer to our democracy.</para><para>The lack of accountability, the smothering of voices, the cover-ups, the defunding of potential critics of the government and the secrecy over policy measures are the modus operandi of Senator Newman and the Howard government.</para><para>We are going to stand up on this issue, as we have. We are going to ensure that we actually get answers to questions like why the Girl Guides have been defunded and why the Women's Electoral Lobby have been defunded. Why can't Senator Newman come clean over this seminal blueprint after delivering such a hollow speech that was laced with a couple of general observations and had a few motherhood statements thrown in for 
 good measure, culminating in a timetable? What a performance from this minister. It was a speech that ended up announcing a task force that had not been properly constructed and was without terms of reference. But, importantly, the promised blueprintâthe promised discussion paperâwas not provided or produced and is now being covered up deliberately by the government. Why can't this minister tell us what she plans for the poor and the needy in our community? What does she have to hide? What is the government hiding in this document that they will not produce?</para><para>Madam President, you have a situation where I think many in the community are entitled to be wary and worried about the contents of this discussion paper that the minister has gone to such extraordinary lengths to cover up. There is no doubt that Senator Newman deserves censure for failing to come clean on this issue. The Howard government needs desperately to clean up its act on accountability issues from the bottom up.</para><para>I know the Democrats put forward a proposal, but they have not been in government. They are wanting to punish Senator Newman now by applying a gag. I can understand the frustration that the Democrats feel. I heard Senator Murray on Monday night's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program saying that the difficulty with accountability is whether you can enforce it or not. He said:</para><para>Now we've tried before to enforce accountability and until Labor are prepared to actually make ministers not be heard, in fact until they're prepared to enforce the Senate's powers, there's a limit to how far the Senate can in fact push accountability.</para><para>You really do understand that no Australian Democrat senator has been a minister and no Australian Democrat has formed a government. You see, gagging a minister like Senator Newman and ensuring that she is not heard in this place is a John Howard technique. That is a Liberal Party technique. Why are the Australian Democrats hell-bent on gagging a minister? If she is gagged and if she is not heard, she has a holiday from accountability. We are not going to be part of that. It means she cannot take legislation 
 through the chamber and she cannot answer questions. It means that she can go off and plot and plan with her bureaucrats and her reference group without explaining herself at all. It is not on.</para><para>This is probably one of the worst ministers in a bad government. Everyone knows Senator Newman's performance here in question time. Everyone has seen her at Senate estimates. This is a minister who can just sit at the table and completely depend on bureaucrats to answer questions, who cannot answer a question in Senate question time and who is simply incapable of responding to serious questions asked of her about public policy in the forums of the Australian parliament. We are not going to gag her. We do not want to be any part of that.</para><para>I do not think the Democrats understand this issue. It was the Democrats who, behind closed doors, let the environment bill go through and did their GST deals. That all went through the Senate under a guillotine. The deal included arrangements for greenhouse, book compensation moneys and so forth. That was all done behind closed doors with John Howard. That might be the way the Democrats do business, but we are not going to have any part of that. The Democrats claim to be champions of accountabilityâI do not think that is the caseâbut they have to look seriously at a proposition which proposes a gag of Senator Newman, because a gag of Senator Newman means that she will evade scrutiny and will not be accountable to the parliament.</para><para>Such a proposal as moved by Senator Bartlett will not provide accountability; it will provide the reverse. Senator Newman would avoid questioning, avoid making parliamentary and ministerial statements and so on and so forth. Avoiding parliamentary scrutiny is not the way to provide a sanction for this minister's failure to comply with an order of the Senate. The Democrats really need now to start grappling with the real outcomes of some of these ideas. Gagging, we know, is a Howard government technique; Senator Newman is a past master of it. We need to ensure that parliament is more accountable, not less accountable. Senator Newman needs to 
 provide her policy paper to the parliament. She is required to do so. Of course, Senator Hill and Senator Alston ought to front up with the 16 Federation Fund projects while they are at it. Perhaps Mr Costello could outline the business tax compliance measures, and perhaps he could reveal the revenue modelling for his business tax proposals as well. I hope that the Democrats would support all those outcomes as well as this.</para><para>We support the censureâit is deservedâbut we oppose the gag. I invite Senator Bartlett and the Australian Democrats to discuss with Labor and other non-government senators some constructive sanctions that will widen accountability to the parliament. I have some suggestions, and I am happy to discuss them with the Democrats, but I do not want to let Senator Newman off the hook. Since Senator Newman became a minister she has consistently had a flawed approach to her ministerial responsibilities. Everyone knows that. Of course, she should not ignore such an order of the parliament. She deserves to be censured, and sanctions are warrantedânot gagging.</para><para>Let us have a look at some sanctions that might really hurt Senator Newman and the government. Why don't we look at a sanction which extends question time until a certain number of non-government questions have been asked and answered each day? Why don't we prevent government ministers and government senators from debate on motions to take note of answers to questions in question time? Why don't we prevent the government from moving extensions to the days and hours of sittings and changing the routine of business in the Senate until Senator Newman complies with this order? They are real sanctions, and the Australian Democrats should give them some serious consideration and talk to other senators and the opposition in the chamber about them. They are more constructive penalties and sanctions. They will cause the government real discomfort. They can be put in place until Senator Newman fronts up as she should with the original document she has so desperately attempted to cover up since her brave announcement of September this year.</para><para>To that effect, in relation to Senator Bartlett's motion, I move:</para><para>Omit subparagraphs (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) and paragraphs (2) and (3).</para><para>This amendment deletes that part of Senator Bartlett's motion in relation to sanctions. That is something we should revisit after we see whether Senator Newman is willing to purge her contempt of the Senate. If the amendment is not passed, Labor cannot support such a censure motion, even though this minister deserves to be roundly censured for what she has done. Let us amend the motion and talk about appropriate sanctions. Let us not put a gag on the minister, a gag on accountability and a gag on parliamentary scrutiny, but let us condemn this minister as she so roundly deserves. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>9533</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, I want to congratulate Senator Faulkner on that speech, because I think it covered the ground very well, in particular the failure of this minister to perform in one of the most important portfolios that a national government has. The minister had flagged at her Press Club speech that she was going to bring out a blueprint of her thinking for social justice in Australia as we go into the next century. Added to the billion dollars per annum taken away from the needy in this country, she was going to outline a list of punishments for single parents, the unemployed and disabled people in this country.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senator interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âIt is not a lie, Senator. You will have your opportunity in a moment. The fact that the minister has refused to follow through with the blueprint that she said she was going to produce herself shows the size of the cover-up in which she is involved. The active agent in the cover-up was not the minister herself; she is gung-ho about these very right wing moves that she wanted to make in her administration of this portfolio. The Prime Minister intervened, as Senator Faulkner has said. Even he could not stomach what the minister was planning. The minders knew that this would cause widespread revulsion amongst the Australian electorate in general. So a speech that Senator Newman was to make had to be sanitised, the process 
 was Kennettised and the doors to information were closed down. It is entirely reasonable, under the circumstances in which the minister has flouted her responsibility to the Senate and therefore to the Australian public to produce this document, that she be censured.</para></talk.start></continue><para>However, the process that the Democrats have brought forward is, as Senator Faulkner has cogently explained, not the right one. It is not helpful in a democracy which depends on information to censure a minister by requiring her to give less informationâby truncating her responsibilities to give further information to the Senate. You might remember, Madam President, the last time these words, that a member of this Senate `not be heard', were used. I remember former Senator O'Chee getting to his feet when I came into the Senate one day without my coat on. He asked that I not be heard until I went out and put my coat on. Here we have the Democrats following that up with the addled view that the minister not be heard until she produces information that she suppressed in the past, in other words, that she should suppress further information. It is not clear thinking and it is the wrong way to go. We are trying to get information out of this minister, not a complete close-down on her responsibility to be giving information to the Senate. There are alternative sanctions. They ought to apply to the government. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility that this minister is not performing in that she has clamped down on the important document that the Senate and the Australian people deserve to see. I would therefore support a future move by the opposition or the Democrats along the lines outlined by Senator Faulkner.</para><para>Let me say this to the Democrats, however. This is a very important matter which has gained national publicity overnight and today, but we have Senator Bartlett on his own in the Senate and a complete absence of the Leader or Deputy Leader of the Democrats, who ought to be prosecuting this very important matter in here right now. If you are going to pursue a matter as important as this, it is important that the whole party is here to prosecute the case. Senator Bartlett, I feel sorry for you that you are left totally aban 
 doned, with none of the other Democrats here to support you and, in particular, the leader missing altogether. I do not know where the leader isâmaybe out negotiating the next round of compromise with the Prime Minister or with other members of the government.</para><para>One is left to believe that the sincerity is not there, that this is a quid pro quo for the concessions that the Democrats are making in taxation and other matters to the very agenda that we want to see Senator Newman called to order on. After all, Madam President, the Democrats did put through the GST legislation, which hits many of the entities that Senator Newman wants to hit again. The Democrats did put through the environment legislation with its extraordinarily damaging flow-ons for the Australian environment, not least the forests of this country. The Democrats did negotiate with the government for the wind-back of century-old and honoured industrial relations provisions to protect people in this country from right-wing moves to disempower workers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âSenator Brown, I would draw your attention to the substance of the motion.

You will also notice that senators have to be able to defend themselves, particularly in my position, and not be cowed by the government and not be deprived of any right to speak or develop an argument if it is proper to do so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me get back to the substance of my argument, to which you are committed to listening, Madam President. It is that on the one hand the Democrats are moving to have the minister prevented from getting information to the Senate through this motion. On the other hand they are dealing with the government behind closed doors in ways which facilitate the very philosophy that this minister puts forward. That is a very important component of this argument. It concerns me greatly that that process is taking place in tandem with this motion today to have the minister's responsibilities to inform the Senate further wound back. Madam President, I think you will agree that that is a legitimate component of this argument.</para><para>That said, I will be supporting the censure of the minister. The minister deserves to be censured. It is totally improper, in a democracy which depends on information going to the electorate, that a paper which the minister herself flagged she was going to release at a Press Club function and therefore to the Australian populace was then suppressedâsuppressed, no doubt, by a prime ministerial review which said, `This is going to be bad news for the government. The Australian public is not going to wear it.' Therefore, the motion for censure is valid. However, the provisions that flow on from the move of the Democrats to have the minister excused from giving further information to the Senate are not valid. I do not think they were well thought out and they do need to be reviewed. The alternative put forward by the Labor Party is a much better way to go.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>9534</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am aston 
 ished actually at the contributions that I have just heard from Senators Brown and Faulkner: they have not contributed anything to the debate on what is an important issue. The hot air that has been generated here this morning is actually evidence of why I was so strong in my speech to the National Press Club for a mature consideration of the issues that I addressed.</para></talk.start><para>I do acknowledge that Senator Bartlett did accept my invitation to go to the Press Club and did sit through what was a very serious speech and, I would say quite properly, a seminal speech: it did reveal my thinking on these issues. For senators who did not go there to claim that there is some kind of hidden agenda or cover-up simply means that they have not done their homework and that it is a political stunt on their part. Can I just read out to senators the final two passages of my speech. I draw these to your attention because they refer to the salient points in the censure debate. This is what I said to the Press Club:</para><para>I particularly want to say to the members of the media here today, that they have an important role in ensuring the debate that our community must have, does not become a sterile exercise characterised by cheap political point scoring and sensational headlines. The job before us is an important one. It goes to the very essence of the way in which we structure our society, the way in which we face the future and the confidence with which we meet the challenges that lie ahead.</para><para>I say also to the many stakeholders in this debate that they must avoid the temptation to adopt a narrow self-interested approach to the debate. It is by working together that the community can develop a sustainable welfare system that provides an effective safety net for those in need, but does not encourage a dependence mentality which is debilitating for the individual, their families and for the community.</para><para>That is what this is all about. That is on the record, in great detail for half an hour to the National Press Club. The people of Australia heard that and I am just astonished that anybody could think that they could sustain a claim that there has been some kind of cover-up or hidden agenda.</para><para>I note that Senator Bartlett was at the Press Club. He did hear my speech and he would have been clearly aware of those comments. 
 They were in no way sanitised; it was an important and significant speech. But Senator Bartlett's censure motion falls directly into the trap which I highlighted in my speechâthat is, turning the much needed community debate on reform of our welfare system into a political exercise. That is a pity because I do believe that at heart Senator Bartlett does have concerns about policy. His effort to go and listen to this, and to the question time that followed, was something that I would also have expected and hopedâon such an important national issueâto have seen from senators on the other side of the chamber, apart from Senator Bartlett.</para><para>But Senator Bartlett's censure motion does not serve or enhance his role in representing the interests of the Democrats or those of the wider community, and I am disappointed in him, I must say. I would have expected better from the social security spokesperson from the Australian Democrats. I have usually found him interested in the issues and in talking through matters of reform. I would have expected it from Senator Faulkner, I would have expected it from Senator Brown but I would not have expected it from Senator Bartlett, and I am disappointed.</para><para>I made it clear in my statement to the Senate yesterday that I am not in a position to give any discussion paper to the Senate at this time. But I did not refuse to provide the Senate with the paper, and anybody who likes to can look at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and see that. I said that I will comply when I provide the completed paper to the reference group shortly. There is no disrespect to the Senate. I told Senator Bartlett, in answer to his question in the Senate two weeks ago, that it was an internal working document and therefore not for tabling. I stand by that; that is consistent.</para><para>The discussion paper is still being developed as the government's submission to the reference group, and it will be completed shortly. Is the Senate not able to wait a short time, as the reference group will be waiting, for it to be completed? As soon as it is completed, I shall give it to the reference group and I am happy to give it to the Senate at the same time. I want to make it absolutely clear that the government is not attempting to 
 hide anything. Both the discussion paperâonce it has been provided to the reference groupâand the final green paper will be public documents. Now what is hidden in that? The public has been invited to make submissions to the reference groupâthere is the involvement of the community in thatâand the final green paper, when it is produced, will also of course be a matter for discussion in the community.</para><para>I announced in my speech on 29 September at the Press Club that further social policy reform would be the next major reform priority of the Howard government. That speech was an agenda setting speech. There is no hidden agenda, as anybody who likes to go and read it will see. And I welcome the Prime Minister's support for making social policy the next major reform priority of the government, quite contrary to some of the slurs that have been produced in the chamber today about the Prime Minister and his involvement.</para><para>Also at that same time I announced that a high level reference group would guide the development of a comprehensive green paperâwhich would be taken to cabinet soon thereafter, but they are public documentsâand they will be involving the public. I have said that Mr Patrick McClure from Mission Australia will chair the reference group. His deputy chair will be Mr Wayne Jackson, the Deputy Secretary to my department, who is very well respected for his policy expertise and strong interest. Other members of the reference group will be announced very shortly.</para><para>I said the reference group was going to consider the broader application of mutual obligation; demographic changes; sustainability of the current system; and incentives for people to train, work and participate in the wider community. I would have thought that most of those would have been things that would have been encompassed by the principles which Senator Bartlett put out in his most recent press release on the subject. But I made it clear yesterday in the Senate that the reference group will draw on community input. It will provide me with a preliminary draft paper early next year, with the final 
 paper to be provided by 30 June. That is a proper and measured process which involves the community. It will obviously involve the parliament and members of the parliament but, very importantly, it will involve the public.</para><para>In answer to a question from the press at the Press Club, I pointed out that this is a discussion which has been held for some time in the wider communityâover the barbecues and in the lounge roomsâin Australia. People from all walks of life have views about our welfare system. They are concerned at the growing long-term welfare dependency of our people and what it does to them and their children. I would have thought that those contributors today who just simply contributed hot air on what is actually a very serious and important matter should be ashamed of themselves. What does the public think about Senators Faulkner and Brown, who are not even prepared to give this matter the serious attention that it deserves?</para><para>I believe no nation can afford to leave unchecked the wasteâthe economic and social isolationâthat is the consequence of welfare dependency. It is this commitment to social and economic participation and the need to best utilise our national resources which leads us to continued welfare reform. Let us get it clear: the social welfare system is not just about government payments; it has to be about all the players in our society working in partnership to develop a social coalition. The Prime Minister has shown great leadership in the need for a social coalition. But it is not just government payments; modernising our welfare system to go into the next century is an important part of our wider reform process. It is integral to a globalised economy and a cohesive society. It should be complementing other policies that promote a skilled, adaptable and productive work force. Appropriately designed, the welfare system is part of the solution, not just residual support for those out of work or in need.</para><para>I set out in my speech at the Press Club the six key principles outlining the approach that reform to the welfare system must take, and I will mention them briefly: maintaining equity, simplicity, transparency and sustaina 
 bility; establishing better incentives for people receiving social security payments, so that work, education and training are rewarded; creating greater opportunities for people to increase self-reliance and capacity-building, rather than merely providing a passive safety net; expecting people on income support to help themselves and contribute to society through increased social and economic participation in a framework of mutual obligation; providing choices and support for individuals and families with more tailored assistance that focuses on prevention and early intervention; and, at the same time, maintaining the government's disciplined approach to fiscal policy. They are proper principles on which reform must be based. They are principles which I think the Australian community believe we should be discussing in reforming our system.</para><para>Do not forget that this is not something which is done in isolation from the rest of the world.

I was actually about to sum up by saying that this is not just an issue for Australia. The Blair government in Britain, the governments of New Zealand and the United States and the OECD have all turned their attention to the waste of human lives that is brought about by welfare dependency and the need for action to do something about it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My seminal speech to the National Press Club set out the problems facing Australia's welfare system and the need for reform. A mature society will not play games on such an important issue. I fear that we have senators here today who are only playing games. We 
 need to work together and talk to each other to find better ways to provide support to those needing help. Long-term welfare dependency is not a kindness; it is simply a way of throwing money at a problem, thereby producing an even greater problem for future generations. I believe Australia can do better than that. I call on the Senate to join with the government in doing better.</para><para>I utterly reject that I am in contempt of the Senate. I told the Senate yesterday that I will provide the paper shortly, when it is completed and it goes to the reference group. In no way can that justify a censure motion. In my view, this motion devalues the use of censure motions, and it is a shame for the Senate to so devalue one of its own procedures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>9537</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is interesting that the Minister for Family and Community Services offered no real defence for her failure to table the discussion paper in compliance with the order of the Senate. I think the key issue here is that yesterday the minister relied on the defence that the paper `is still being developed'. Quite frankly, Minister, we do not believe you. It is not at all consistent with anything you have said for the last three weeks. You walked in yesterday with a new defenceâyour last line of defenceâwhich was that the paper is still being developed. Until then we had not heard that line of defence. There had been a series of defences offered previously, but that was not one of them. But that was the one you used yesterday. You have shifted and turned as this embarrassing episode has put you under a lot of pressureâinternally within the governmentâas the debate rages inside the government about the future of welfare policy.</para></talk.start><para>But the key issue here, Madam President, is that we do not believe the minister. It may well be that the discussion paper is being rewritten as we speak. I suspect it is, because clearly the Prime Minister did not like the tone or the direction of the original paper. But what the Senate is debating today is a censure of the minister for her failure to comply with the order that she release the discussion paper that she was preparing to release on 29 
 Septemberâthe paper that she told us she was going to release; the paper that her media advisers hyped up all around the Press Gallery, telling journalists that she was going to release it on 29 September. That is the paper we want to see, not the reworked, sanitised version she is working on now to present to a committee for which she still has not been able to get a membership together. What we want is the original paper. That is what the Senate asked for. The minister has failed to offer any reasonable defence for not providing that to us, because there is no defence. There is just severe embarrassment on her part that the Prime Minister does not want that paper released. The Prime Minister does not want that to be at the core of the debate. But we think the Australian people and the Australian parliament have a right to see it. The minister keeps describing it as `seminal'. If it is seminal, let us see it. Let us all have the ability to debate it.</para><para>I think it is important that we go through the arguments as to why we do not believe the minister, because that is at the core of this: we do not believe Senator Newman. In the days leading up to the Wednesday 29 September speech, the press was full of discussion about the speech. There was to be released an agenda setting discussion paper. It was hyped up in all the national papers that this was going to be a major speech with a major, agenda setting seminal discussion paper. Every leading newspaper in the country carried the story, describing it as an agenda setting paper. How did they all get it so wrong? How did the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> all get it so wrong? It is an answer that the minister has failed to give us.</para><para>What we do know is that sometime over the weekend leading up to that Press Club speech there was furore inside the government. The Prime Minister intervened and there was a serious dispute inside the government as to the direction of social welfare policy and/or the timing of the release of the discussion paper. That was what was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> but, even following that intervention, the minister was obviously fighting on. Her press people were still up in 
 the gallery selling the story, saying that the minister had not been nobbled and that reports of her being pulled into line by the Prime Minister were wrong. She was still going to release this agenda setting paper. I quote from an article by Aban Contractor in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 30 SeptemberâI think it is important that I read this into the record. The article states:</para><para>A spokesman for Senator Newman said the decision to pull the paper had been made within the past two weeks, but he told the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>  on Monday that copies would be available on the morning of the Minister's speech. Mr Howard had not vetoed publication, he said.</para><para>We have the minister first of all saying that there was not a paper and that it had not been vetoed, but we have her own spokesman quoted in the paper, outlining her fightback against the Prime Minister's intervention. The article goes on to say:</para><para>"It's not necessarily been pulled," the spokesman said. "It's been referred to the discussion group and it will be an important part of the group's resources."</para><para>So here he wasâthe minister's spokespersonâdescribing the paper, describing its purpose, describing its role, fighting back against the Prime Minister's intervention, saying that it would be still available, that the minister was going to win this battle with the Prime Minister and that it would be still available. Now the minister says it is still being developed; it has not been written. Was the spokesman lying? Has he been sacked? Or was the minister misleading the parliament today? We do not believe the minister because it is not consistent with anything said by her or her office in the weeks leading up to this debate. Every leading paper in the country, apparently, got it wrong because they misinterpreted what the minister and her office were saying to them.</para><para>On Wednesday, 29 September, Senator Bartlett asked the minister to table the discussion paper, and her reply was this:</para><para>No, I will not. It is an internal working document which will inform the work of the reference group.</para><para>There is no mention of it not being completed, no mention that it was still being written. She refused to table it because it was an internal working document. There was no 
 question about it not being completedâjust the mere assertion that in her view it was an internal working document that we should not see. That was her view and that was fine. We disagreed with her view, but her view was that this paper, which she had been going to release on Wednesday, 29 September, was an internal working document now and she would not release it to us.</para><para>When she was asked about it on the same day at the Press Club she said, `I am sending it to the committee.' Again, no mention that it was not completed. She only mentioned that she would be sending it to the committee. It was to form the basis of their considerations. On Friday, 1 October in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> there was a discussion which indicated that the minister wanted a comprehensive debateânot, she was quoted as saying, `just a five-minute flash of paper'. So her defence on that day in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> was just that she did not want the paper to be the sole focus of the debate. That was her reason for not releasing it on Friday the 1st.</para><para>The minister has shifted and turned throughout this episode, trying to find a way through. But what is clear is that the minister is not telling us the truth about this paper in her latest defence. There was a paper, it was to be released, she presold it to the press, but it was withdrawn at the last minute. The parliament has asked for it to be made available to it, and she now says there is no such paper or it is still in a stage of development. That is not true and it is misleading the Senate to claim that it is true.</para><para>On 30 September, the Senate adopted Senator Bartlett's motion. Thirteen days later, the minister wanders into Senate question time and, at 3 o'clock right on the knocker, Senator Lightfoot, of all people, gets up to provide the dorothy dixer for her to explain why she has failed to table the paper. Right on the knocker of the deadline of the order of the Senate, the dorothy dixer was asked. Her answer to Senator Lightfoot was, `It is still being developed.' In 13 days we had not heard this excuse. In 13 days this defence had not been offered, but, for the first time in 13 daysâand longer if you add the three or four days of hyping up the document to the press 
 prior to the Press Club luncheon speechâthe minister offered that defence. It was her excuse for not tabling the paper. It took her 13 days to come up with that excuse. Quite frankly, I think she should have done better because for 13 days work it was a pretty poor effort. It reminded me of a naughty schoolgirl trying to explain her excuses for failing to do her homework. It is like saying `The dog ate it' or `It fell in the fire'. That is the best she could do in terms of defending the fact that the Prime Minister stopped her from releasing it, and she does not want to release it now.</para><para>I just do not think it is good enough for the minister to try to rely on that defence. She has no reason for not releasing it other than that it will be politically damaging, she thinks, to the government. That is not a reasonable excuse. The paper was hyped up by her and her staff. They sold the importance of it. She created fear and uncertainty in the community by alluding to the sorts of changes in welfare policy that would be contained in it. But, having created that, she now seeks to blame Senator Bartlett or Mr Wayne Swan for the fear, uncertainty and concern about that debate. She created the debate and she created the fear and uncertainty by hyping up, in pre-publicity of the speech and the paper, what it contained. She mentioned that there would be an attack on sole parents' entitlements. She mentioned that there would be an extension of mutual obligation to disability support pensioners.</para><para>These people are worried because the minister's own office and the minister herself started this debate about their entitlements. They have a right to know now what she intends. They do not intend to be fobbed off by some suggestion that she will rework the paper and send it off to a committee. They have a right to know and the parliament has a right to know. This is a debate that she created. This is a debate that she intended starting, and it is no good trying to blame the Democrats or the Labor Party now that the debate has been commenced. We have a right to know what was considered so seminal. We have a right to know what was considered so important by the minister right up until the day of her speech.</para><para>Up until that time, she was describing her discussion paper as `seminal', as `significant', and as an `important agenda-setting paper'. She then went on to describe her speech as a `blasted good speech'. Admittedly, Senator Newman was the author of all those superlatives about her speech and the paper. I have not seen one other commentator describe them in such glowing terms, because there was nothing in the speech. By the time the Prime Minister got to her, there was nothing in the speech except the announcement of the establishment of a committee. She could not tell us what the terms of references were for that committee. She could not tell us who was to be on the committee, although Mr McClure got rung up the night before and agreed to chair it. This was a last minute fix-up to try to hide the fact that the discussion paper had been pulled. There is no question about that.</para><para>For the minister to try to continue to hype up her contribution at the Press Club, given that it was largely content free, is a nonsense. The content was in the discussion paperâshe knows it; we know itâthe completed discussion paper that was to be tabled and presented at the Press Club on that day. That paper is in existence. It was ready to go. The minister said it was ready to go. Her media adviser said it was ready to go. They talked it up all through the press gallery and all through the Australian communityâthis paper was going to be seminal. Now she says, `Oh, we're still working on it. It's not completed. You can have it when it's finished.' I do not believe you, Minister. It was going to be finished for Wednesday, 29 September. It was not presented, for reasons best known to the government. But we have a right to see it. The people who will be affected by the changes you propose have a right to see it. It is no good saying to us now, `Oh, well, we're still working on it. You can have it some time down the track when I find enough people to serve on the committee and when I sort out the process.' That is not an answer to the order of the Senate that says we want to get a copy of the discussion paper you were going to release then, not the reworked, rehashed, sanitised version. We want a copy of the paper that you said was to be so seminal, that you said was to be so important and that you said was 
 to be an agenda-setting paper. That is the one we want to see.</para><para>If there are now two papers, as I suspect there are, we are not interested in the second one. We will see that when you send it off to the committee. I think we are quite happy to wait for that one, Senator Bartlett. What we do want to see is the one that was to be released on Wednesday, 29 September. When the minister comes in here, as I say, like a naughty schoolgirl who has not done her homework and the best excuse she can give is, `We're still working on it,' we do not believe her. The Senate should not believe her and the Australian public should not believe her, because it is not consistent with anything she has said for the last two weeks. She dreams up this weak excuse 13 days later and comes in here and patronises Senator Bartlett and says, `I expected better of you, Senator Bartlett.' You should get used to it, Senator BartlettâI have been patronised by her a lot. You are joining a very large club.</para><para>The point is that the Senate made an order for that discussion paper to be tabled, and the minister has failed to comply with that order. The Senate has a right, an obligation and a duty to censure the minister for failing to comply with that. She has offered no good excuse as to why it should not be presented to the Senate. Her excuse was absolutely pathetic. To pretend that it is still being worked on when she had so hyped it up, so sold it to the Australian media and the Australian public that it would be released on Wednesday, 29 September and two weeks later come in and say `We're still working on it' is just incredulous. It is just not the truth. There may well be work going on on that paper now, but we do not want to see the sanitised, revised version. We want to see the original version that was to be presented on Wednesday, 29 September. The Australian community and those who rely on social security support in this country have a right to see that paper.</para><para>The minister now says that she wants a proper debate. I agree with her. We ought to have a proper debate, and the starting point for that debate is the government's discussion paper. If the minister wants a rational, con 
 sidered, intelligent debate I am happy to join in, but let us see the paper.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âThat would be the first time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âSenator Kemp, you may say that it is for the first time.

But it is not fair to come in here and sell the direction of the policy paper, sell the importance of the paper and talk about how important it is going to be to the government's agenda and then say, `We're not going to release it to the public.' The Senate quite rightly ordered that it be released. The Senate, I think, has to stand on its obligations to the Australian community and insist that the paper be released now. As I have said, and I want to make the point very clearly, we are not interested in what the minister is reworking now and what might go to the committee. We are interested in the discussion paper that she said would be released on Wednesday, 29 September. That is the one the order applied to and that is the one we want to see. I urge the Senate to support the censure motion.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>9541</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have witnessed some feeble censure motions in this place, but I regret to say that this one creates a new bottom line.

In actual fact, we were careful in relation to censure motions. We moved them rarely and we only moved them in relation to serious matters. What apparently is being called for here, and it was emphasised by Senator Chris Evans's contribution, are really the internal documents of Senator Newman in her responsibility as the Minister for Family and Community Services. Senator Newman is contributing to the development of policy which she will presumably, ultimately, take to cabinet and seek to have it endorsed and, if so, implemented through legislation or administration.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is an ongoing responsibility and process of government. Ministers are doing this every day, and all honourable senators are aware of this. To come in here and to attempt to censure the minister for failing to put on the table those internal workings is extraordinary and, as far as I know, unprecedented. We understood that what was being sought was an open and transparent process with this public reference group.</para><para>Let me recall the history of this matter. Senator Newman recently made a very important speech on social security reform at the press club. It builds upon her record as an innovative and reformist minister. She went further and said that, in the development of a new range of reforms, she wished to have a public process. She said that she would set up a reference group which would consult with the public on future reforms, and she would assist that reference group by providing it with a discussion paper. It is a process of achieving legislative and administrative reform that should be commended. She said that that discussion paper can be made a public document when it has been delivered to the reference group, so that everybody knows what the government has in mind in relation to the work of the reference groupâagain, something that I would have thought should be applauded.</para><para>The motion that was moved originally by Senator Bartlett said that that discussion 
 group should be made public. We accept that; that is fine. It should be made public, and Senator Newman has said that as soon as the discussion paper is delivered to the reference group, it will be tabled in this place and will therefore be on the public record. So what is she being censured for? Having indicated that she will make public the document that will be delivered to the reference group, Senator Bartlett stood up yesterday and said, `That's not good enough. What I was really talking about in my motion of demand'âthe motion that was passed in this placeâ`are preceding documents.'</para><para>Madam President, that is not what Senator Bartlett had in his motion at all. His motion, which was carried by the Senate, asked:</para><para>That the Senate</para><para>(a) notes that the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman) will be providing a discussion paper to her newly-established reference group developing a green paper on welfare reform;</para><para>(b) supports the notion of an open, public and wide-ranging community debate on the future of Australia's welfare system;â</para><para>I am pleased the Democrats support thatâ</para><para>and</para><para>(c) requires that the discussion paper mentioned in (a)â</para><para>that is, the discussion paper that she will be presenting to the reference groupâ</para><para>be laid on the table . . . </para><para>which is exactly what she has said she will do. But that is not good enough for Senator Bartlett. He said that his first clause really referred to preceding documents that are not going to be given to the discussion groupâworking documents in the development of the discussion paper. Senator Bartlett said that these are the papers that the motion really referred toâor should have referred toâand, because they are not being tabled, she should now be censured. There is no basis for a censure in those circumstances. She is going to comply with the order that the Senate made, but she cannot comply with it within the time frame because the document that is to be presented to the reference committee has still not been finalised. How could one sensibly and rationally censure a minister in those 
 circumstances? That is why I say that, regrettably, this censure motion achieves a new low and further devalues the currency. If we are concerned that censure motions are not taken seriously by the community now, this will not help.</para><para>There are two points. Firstly, the motion was incorrectly drawn. If Senator Bartlett wanted the Senate to adopt a motion requiring working documents, he should have said so in his motion. Secondly, because Senator Bartlett was seeking internal documentsâand as Senator Bartlett knows, it has been a long- standing practice that governments do not normally put on the table working documents; otherwise, the whole process of government would grind to a halt if every minute that Senator Kemp worked on had to be then tabledâthey would not be tabled in any event. For those reasons, this censure certainly should not succeed today and, if it does, it will not be taken seriously by the community.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to say a few things. Firstly, it is a privilege and a pleasure to work with Senator Newman. She has been an excellent Minister for Family and Community Services. She not only has been sensitive to her constituency but she has also has accepted the responsibility to ensure that public money is wisely spent. If you look through the reforms that she has been able to implement so far, you will see both trains of thought. Public money is targeted to where it is most needed.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>âYes, Senator, we do not apologise for that; we have always said that the best form of welfare is a job. We have an entirely different approach from the Australian Labor Party to these matters. Where money has not been wisely spent, and where it has been abused, Senator Newman has come down hard, and that angers the ALP as well. But it is something that is applauded by the community at large. As I said, it has been a privilege and a pleasure to work alongside such a successful minister. Long may she continue in her role, doing the good work that she is doing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second point I want to make is that being able to stand on a good record is not 
 enough for Senator Newman. She wants to move the agenda on to do even better for the future. For that, I commend her as well. In many ways, it is her determination to keep proceeding down a path that the community strongly supports and that the Labor Party condemns in here today. She has been a reformist minister. She would make no apology for that, and I appreciate it. She is prepared to continue down the reform path and I commend her for that.</para><para>Thirdly, I commend her willingness to engage in open and transparent process, to set up this reference group and to bring the community into the debate. These issues are complex and it is much better if the community can understand and be incorporated in the process. Her willingness to engage the community is something I applaud. Her willingness, therefore, to put this discussion paper on the public record as it is delivered to the reference group and therefore to facilitate the Senate as well as the community at large is something that the Senate should be acknowledging with appreciation, not condemning her for. I note that the other side are giggling.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>âThat demonstrates that the other side does not take this matter seriously. That is what we regretâthe devaluation of censure motions. They are not taken seriously by the Labor Party. They have therefore lost their serious aspect as far as the community is concerned. I do not think that is in the Senate's interest in the long term.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a minister who deserves to be applauded, not condemned. This is a censure motion that deserves to be thrown out, and I trust that it will be today. Even if it is carried, I regret to say that nobody will take it seriously because it has failed in the terms of the motion and it has failed in terms of seeking to meddle in the internal business of government. It is inconsistent with the willingness of the minister to put the discussion paper on the public record at the appropriate time. I urge senators to dismiss this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>9543</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâIn closing the debate on this motion, what has sunk to a new low in this 
 debate is not the worthwhileness of the censure motion but the feebleness of the arguments put forward by the government in relation to why they are not complying with the return to order. It is something I find breathtaking. The whole concept that the minister has always been keen to be open and willing and desirous of having a public debate on this seems like a very recent invention.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Hill tried to point out some alleged inconsistency in relation to this motion and the original return to order. The only reason there is any possibility of even being able to try to make that argument is that it wasn't until yesterday that somehow or other we now have two discussion papers around the placeâthe original discussion paper which has now been transformed into a `working document' and the discussion paper that is still being prepared. The suggestion that there was never any finalised discussion paper that was going to be released at the Press Club beggars belief. It is a new low in terms of excuses put forward by a minister and by a government as to why they refuse to comply with an order of the Senate.</para><para>It wasn't until yesterday that any suggestion had been put forward by the minister that there wasn't a complete discussion paper that was already in her possession. To now suggest that there was never any discussion paper, that it was always a work in progress, a working document, that it is inappropriate for the Senate to try to access is a highly dubious argument, to put it politely. The minister and the government are now suggesting that they have a work in progress and they will willingly and gladly table that when it is finished. I am glad the minister is now deciding that she is willing to table that. I would remind the Senate that, when I initially asked the minister during question time to table the discussion paper rather than just provide it in private to the reference group, she refused. At that time she said: `I am going to give it to the reference group, I am not going to table it and I am not going to make it public; bad luck.'</para><para>So I guess if there is one positive aspect of this debate and of the original return to order it is that it has obviously at least changed the 
 minister's mind about the appropriateness of making the document that she provides to the reference group a public document. Unfortunately, what we are now seeing is that that document will not be the discussion paper that she had prepared originally for the Press Club. She is rewriting it. One would find it difficult to do anything other than to assume that she is sanitising it in the process.</para><para>Let me quote from a couple of press reports today in relation to the existence of this discussion paper. As, I think, Senator Evans highlighted, Senator Newman's staff were strongly beating up throughout the press gallery in the lead-up to her Press Club speech the existence of the discussion paper, how groundbreaking it was going to be and when it was going to be provided. I refer to Kate Hannon's piece in today's <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Mercury</inline>, stating that Senator Newman had originally promised to release the 20-page discussion paper on ideas for welfare reform during a National Press Club speech. Only last night a spokesperson for the minister said that the minister had never claimed a discussion paper would be ready for release in time for the Press Club. I have yet to find a journalist who wasn't aware that it had been claimed quite frequently and with great pride that the discussion paper was going to be released. How everybody seemed to be of the view that it was a 20-page discussion paper, if it was a non-existent work in progress set of working documents, is beyond me. I quote from Aban Contractor's piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> today:</para><para>A spokesperson for Senator Newman said two weeks ago that the paper had already been referred to the committeeâ</para><para>that is the reference group, I presumeâ</para><para>and would form an important part of its resources.</para><para>So let us, for starters, highlight the hollowness of the government's claim that there is no complete discussion paper and it is a work in progress which is inappropriate for the government to table.</para><para>The Democrats certainly do take this censure motion and all censure motions seriously. Senator Hill was the subject of a censure by the Senate earlier this year. I do not think he took that one terribly seriously. That is more 
 an indication of an overall attitude of the government than any degradation of the seriousness that the Senate puts on these issues. Senator Faulkner, when he was in government, had been the subject of a censure motion, I think an unsuccessful one. It is interesting in that context to put that in line with the ALP's response to the second component of my motion to try to put some sort of ongoing sanction on the minister.</para><para>One would think, if the ALP were serious about censure motions, they would back measures to have constructive sanctions. One has to wonder about the seriousness of the ALP's approach to the motion when they themselves are not willing to back it up with any teeth. Nonetheless, the Democrats will reluctantly accept the ALP's amendments to ensure that at least a censure motion is passed. I am happy to talk to the ALP or to any other senator about measures other than those put forward but I am surprised today that they have not actually put any suggestions forward as amendments.</para><para>I am reminded again of the statement on this issue by Labor's shadow spokesperson, Mr Wayne Swan, who is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> today saying that he did have some problems with proposals I was putting forward but that `We agree on the objective. We are prepared to be very tough on her.' We have not seen any evidence of that here today unfortunately. It looks like a fairly weak response in the case of the Labor Party. I am pleased they are supporting the censure motion, but I do not see any evidence at all of any tough action in relation to following that through with concrete sanctions.</para><para>It was suggested and there were arguments put forward about why what amounts to a gag on the minister was inappropriate. I remind the Senate, as I said in my initial contribution, that in large part what is contained in here is actually a straight steal from what was put forward in the Senate in 1994 as a proposed course of action in relation to a minister who was in contempt of the Senate. It is a precedent which was already there, on which we are willing to build.</para><para>I also point again to the actions of the New South Wales upper house, which not only 
 gagged a minister but repeatedly threw him out altogether, which is obviously a much more serious action. I suggest again that is an established precedent and one of the few precedents in Australian parliaments for concrete sanctions against a minister who is in contempt of a house of parliament. It is in that spirit of trying to build on such precedents as exist that we put forward what is contained in the second part of this motion. Nonetheless, we are willing to consider other proposals, even though, unfortunately, none were put forward today. So the opportunity to implement them as part of this censure motion is lost.</para><para>Again, I would have to wonder whether or not Labor are keen not to get measures adopted by the Senate which set the precedent of concrete action against ministers who refuse to comply with orders of the Senate, obviously thinking about a time when they may be in government in the future and subject to such sanctions themselves. The Labor Party are obviously happy to frustrate and destabilise the entire government. They want to create a hostile Senate for the Howard government, but the Democrats are keen to ensure that the Senate does perform its role in an ongoing sense which will enable us to consider legislation. We would look at any proposals in that context. I find it difficult to believe that Labor is serious about the issue of following through a censure motion with concrete sanctions. Otherwise, they would have had amendments available, but I am quite happy to be proven wrong on that and am willing to consider concrete proposals that are put forward.</para><para>I was going to say that I should respond briefly to some of the comments by Senator Brown, but in some respects I probably should not bother. Perhaps I need to answer them. Probably only Senator Brown could somehow turn a censure motion on the social security minister into an attack on the Democrats's position on an environment bill. I guess that is par for the course in relation to his ongoing attempts to continue to provide misinformation about the Democrats' action on the environment bill. Somehow or other, it seems to concern Senator Brown that the 
 Democrats talk to the government, to the opposition and to other members of parliament. I suggest to him that it is actually not too bad an idea when you are in the parliament to talk to other parliamentarians if you want to get things through, but I guess he can go about things the way he chooses.</para><para>It is worth correcting the record in relation to his ongoing misinformation about the environment legislation. Rather than revisit that debate, perhaps I will just point him to a piece in today's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> highlighting views of the Local Government Association of Queensland that there has been a massive expansion of federal government powers in relation to environment legislation as a result of the amendments that the Democrats put forward. Now over 90 per cent of Queensland could theoretically fall within the federal government's jurisdiction for planning approval. I would also draw his attention to a speech by Mr Hugh Morganânot renowned as a tree huggerâabout the new piece of environment legislation and complaining about the fact that it has now put environment issues centre stage. I suggest he have a read of that speech, which is available on the Internet under the Business Council of Australia web site and complains about the fact that biodiversity conservation and ecological integrity have now become fundamental in decision makingâa good outcome from the Democrats' point of view; obviously a bad outcome from Hugh Morgan's point of view and apparently from Senator Brown's point of view as well.</para><para>We also had the new concept in Senate debate that somehow or other, unless I have my entire parliamentary party present in the chamber with me, the party is not serious about the measure that is put forward. I suppose it is easy for Senator Brown to have his entire party here with him each time he speaks, given that he is the only one here. It is not surprising that he often does not have other senators in the chamber supporting him when he follows that sort of logic, which is not to say that I am not happy to have my colleagues here when I am speaking. I am sure Senator Lees and Senator Stott Despoja would do a far better job than I would at 
 putting forward arguments, which is why they are leader and deputy. Nonetheless, I am pleased that they have sufficient confidence in me to actually put forward a motion on my own without having to sit here and keep an eye on me. It is a curious new benchmark that is being suggested in relation to motions put forward in this place. Perhaps when Senator Brown has an approach where you do not talk to anybody else while you are in this place, then maybe he does not have anything else to do with his time while he is here.</para><para>There were many comments in the debate about the adequacy or otherwise of Senator Newman's performance as Minister for Family and Community Services and in the social security area. I will not comment on those at the moment. I think that we have plenty of opportunities to debate such issues. As with many ministers, I could provide lots of criticism and also some compliments about varying actions of the minister. But what we are debating today is not the performance of the minister across her whole portfolio: we are debating the principal issue of a return to order which has not been complied with by the minister and the right of the Senate and the powers of the Senate to require a minister or a government to table particular documents. It is about that fundamental issue of the powers of the parliament as against the executive. It is that issue where the minister has completely failed to comply with the return to order. As I said at the start, she has put forward one of the more feeble excuses I have heard yet as to why she has not chosen to do that.</para><para>If this was just a bunch of working documents in progress, I could understand some of the comments that Senator Hill put forward. But clearly it was, and is, a concrete and specifically detailed discussion paper and it is completely appropriate for the Senate to seek to have it tabled, particularly in the context of the statements that the minister and her colleagues have made about the need for a public, open, ongoing and widespread comprehensive debate about welfare policy in this country. The difficulty of doing that, when the fundamental component of the government's plans is not made public, is pretty self- 
evident. It is no surprise that there are claims about hidden agendas of the government, secret agendas and concerns about harsh measures that may be contained in it, if it is not made public.</para><para>Again, I would urge the minister to reconsider her approach to this. She is concerned about beat-ups and scare campaigns being waged about what the government may or may not propose in this area. It is a sensitive area, but it is an important one. You are much more likely to be able to prevent scare campaigns and beat-ups if you have everything out in the open rather than refuse to table a document that we all know exists, which is a comprehensive document and obviously contains some concrete proposals or suggestions for the future of welfare reform in this country. It is much more appropriate to have that out in the open. You would prevent claims of scare campaigns and hidden agendas if you ceased to hide it. That is the concern that the Democrats have in this debate. We believe it is one that needs to be had but, unfortunately, we cannot have a comprehensive debate without the minister being open about what is being proposed.</para><para>Once again, I come back to the fundamental issue of this now newly redefined discussion paper which has suddenly been transformed into a `work in progress' and suggest that, if it is to be tabled at some later dateâobviously I have no objection to it being tabledâwith a suggestion that that is the document which the Senate is seeking to be tabled, not only would we have concerns about contempt of the Senate in relation to not complying with a return to order but also we would be looking seriously at a misleading of the Senate if a sanitised document is tabled and tried to be presented as the original discussion paper. That is a concern that I would have. Again, I hope that the minister does not go down that path.</para><para>In conclusion, the censure motion is an important one. It is one that the Democrats take seriously, even if the government does not. From its response to previous censure motions, it is not something which it takes seriously, unfortunately. That is why I sought to add on to it specific concrete sanctions to 
 highlight to the government how seriously we do take this issue. It is unfortunate that they will not be agreed to by the Senate and that no other concrete proposals are being put forward in their place. There is precedent now in Australian parliaments, via the New South Wales upper house, for actions such as those to be taken, and I hope that the Senate will consider alternative constructive sanctionsâin the words of Senator Faulknerâand not continue the precedent of not following through with any concrete sanctions linked to censure motions.</para><para>I would have a concern that Labor does not want to set a precedent in that regard for when it ends up back in government, but I am quite willing, and indeed hopeful, that it will prove me wrong in that regard. Nonetheless, I will have to accept the Labor Party amendment, reluctantly, to ensure that at least the initial basic censure motion does get through. Once again, I call on the minister to reconsider the issue and to comply with the other part of the motion which will remain, and which will be passed, which is for her to table the original discussion paper which we all know exists and which we all know was a finalised discussion paper at the time indicated in the motion.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett's</inline> )âas amendedâbe agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:25:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

The Australian Democrats support these amendments. In the process of developing them, I omitted yesterday to thank my adviser Lee Jones who has assisted me greatly in this process. He has interacted with the government on their amendments and, as I have said already, we do support them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These amendments are largely of a technical or corrective nature, but I do note that a number of them give effect to policy changes which the minister has made in response to the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I would make the point that this is how governments should behave. There is no point in having a joint committee which considers these matters on an objective and independent basis if the government do not respond positively to them where they can see their way to doing so. I thank the government for dealing positively with that report.</para><para>In dealing with a few of those amendments briefly, amendment No. 8 responds to a recommendation contained in my own supplementary report. That recommendation was that, regardless of the type of consideration being offered for shares in a takeover situation, the minimum consideration on offer 
 must at least equal the maximum paid during the four months before the date of the bid. The existing provision only imposed that requirement where one of the forms of consideration offered was cash. If cash was not being offered, the requirement did not apply. I am glad the government saw fit to accept that recommendation.</para><para>Amendment No. 19 establishes an internal revenue mechanism for decisions made by the Corporations and Securities Panel. The Democrats were concerned that, in its present form, the legislation had provided no redress whatsoever for a person aggrieved by a decision made by the panel. We are happy to see the provision for internal review of panel decisions, which will hopefully balance the need for an appeal mechanism against the desire to avoid lengthy court appeals during the takeover process.</para><para>In making those remarks, I should say in passing that the committee noted, in its interaction with the UK takeover panel by telephone conference, that that takeover panel had been free of court appeals and court processes because its own process of dealing with takeovers is so well accepted in the market. I hope that the new takeover panel will indeed have that same atmosphere and culture surrounding it.</para><para>Amendment No. 20, which we are also considering at this time, picks up another recommendation in our supplementary report to the joint committee's inquiry, namely, allowing an extended range of persons to obtain enforcement of the orders by the Corporations and Securities Panel rather than just ASIC. Orders of the panel will now be able to be enforced by any person to whom the order relates, any party to the proceedings or the president of the panel. It was the Australian Institute of Company Directors that expressed concern with the original limitation. It was suggested that limiting applications for enforcement to ASIC alone was consistent with the objective of curbing the litigious nature of takeover activity.</para><para>As I said in my supplementary report, I am of the view that allowing enforcement applications by persons other than ASIC will: firstly, not result in any substantial increase 
 in litigation given that there must first be an order on foot and a contravention of that order before an application can be made; and, secondly, relieve ASIC of the need to become involved in litigation which is essentially between private citizens. Once again I thank the government for including that in their own amendments. That is all I have to say on those government amendments and I repeat that we support them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>9561</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to indicate briefly that the opposition support the amendments. The <inline ref="r670">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Bill 1998</inline>  and these amendments seek to revamp the takeover panel based on the UK model. While we are supportive of the principle that a body can act in arbitration to settle takeover disputes as an alternative to the courts, we have some doubts about our ability to emulate the success of the UK's panel.</para></talk.start><para>Australia has a somewhat different business culture to that of Britain, based on evidence provided to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. British corporations are less adversarial and less inclined to pursue litigation compared to their Australian counterparts. It is because of these concerns that the opposition support the government's amendments to their own bill on the takeover panel. We hope that these changes will boost the relevance and authority of the takeover panel in considering debates arising during the takeover process.</para><para>I would, however, like to draw one interesting parallel. The government seem dead keen to have some sort of independent arbitrator outside of the courts when it comes to a battle between their corporate mates. But when it comes to industrial relations we have a situation where they want the courts involved. They want to take away the powers of the independent umpire. It seems to me that they are setting a double standard here. They are setting a standard which says it is all right for our corporate mates to have a chat and go through this independent process with lots of powers and no constant litigation or extra costs, but if you are a worker or a union you are going to lose under this government's ideological war. You are going to lose 
 protections and rights, and you are going to have the capacity to arbitrate taken away.</para><para>I find it interesting that there is such a staggering double standard. I am hoping that in later debates this can again be highlighted: there is one rule for the bosses and the companies, but if you are a worker or a union then you are going to have to be open to the influence of lawyers, courts and all sorts of actions to try to break and destroy you. I hope the Senate and the senators in this chamber are conscious of this double standard when it comes, in a few months time, to dealing with a number of issues revolving around the so-called second wave or third wave or fourth wave or whatever we are up to by the time it finally gets here. It is important to emphasise that double standard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>9561</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Temporary Chairman Sherry, I must apologise to you and my colleagues because I was not alert enough to the fact that I wanted one item in the government amendments being put to be considered later.

The government has argued that the common law has not provided the necessary degree of certainty with regard to the duties of directors, which has hampered them from doing their jobs effectively. Thus it argues that legislation is required to correct this and to encourage risk taking by directors. The opposition disagrees.</para><para>The common law has provided adequate consideration of directors' rights and has, in the main, restricted itself from second guessing directors' decisions. There already exists a so-called business judgment doctrine as a result of the case of Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v. Woodside 1968. A statutory business judgment rule is therefore unnecessary. It is also unnecessary because there has been scarce litigation regarding directors' decisions. Even when directors are brought to court they are rarely penalised or found at fault. The case of Vrisakis v. Australian Securities Commission 1995 underlines this point. For those unfamiliar with this case, the court found that it could not convict Vrisakis, a non-executive director, for statutory breach of care and diligence. The court agreed that, as he was in the situation of salvaging a sinking company, he needed to consider more risky proposals, otherwise the company would have definitely failed. Where is the concern?</para><para>The government assumes that the business judgment rule will be sufficient to encourage directors to take risky decisions that could prove profitable. This is ridiculous. Market mechanisms exist which give directors incentives to perform. If directors fail to perform, it will be reflected in the company's performance and in its stock prices. If the directors also own stocks in their company or are involved in schemes which tie their remuneration to the company's performance, then I have no doubt that those directors are doing all they can to improve the performance of their companies.</para><para>Directors have blamed the AWA Ltd v. Daniels 1992 and the Daniels v. Anderson 1995 cases for the uncertainty, but these cases in fact clarified directors' duties. What is made clear is that, so long as directors actively participated in the company's affairs and 
 based their decisions on an informed basis, they would not be penalised even if the company ultimately failed. The standards may have been raised, but these are appropriate to ensure directors take their fiduciary role of managing other people's assets seriously. Directors should not be excused if they fail in their duties, which usually means economic loss for other Australians. This is what the government's business judgment rule would do: it would effectively remove directors' exposure to negligence. Why should directors be treated differently from other professionals?</para><para>The government's proposed business judgment rule was inspired by a similar law in the US state of Delaware. It is quite interesting to note, however, that the business judgment rule did little to protect directors from litigation and thus did little to provide certainty or clarity. The case of Smith v. Gorkom of 1985, considered in the Delaware Supreme Court, found the directors wanting in their decision making process. This was in spite of the existence of a business judgment rule. The key issues that weighed against the directors in this case were that they were not fully informed and had not applied independent judgment when making their decision. Also, the court found that their decision was not made in good faith due to haste and lack of prudence in making the decision. The big question now is whether the Smith v. Gorkom case would receive the same judgment and lead to a similar outcome under the proposed new regime of the government. For that matter, is the government's codification in step with the judgment in the Daniels v. Anderson case? That is, does the government accept that directors need to `take reasonable steps to place themselves in a position to guide and monitor the management of the company'? Moreover, do you agree that directors cannot use ignorance and a failure to inquire in making their decision as a protection against liability for negligence?</para><para>I expect the government's response to be negative in all instances. The government has drafted a bill that would ensure negligent directors are not held accountable. Why propose a safe harbour when directors get 
 away with enough as it is? The Burns Philp episode shows that, no matter how bad you are as a director, you will not face any sort of sanction. As ASIC's chairman acknowledged, `incompetency is not a crime'. ASIC's assessment of the Burns Philp fiasco found that there was a lack of mix of independent and non-independent members on the board. Also, while outside expertise was sought in certain valuations, not all the relevant information was passed on to the valuer and the directors themselves did not apply independent judgment in considering the expert's valuations. I believe that it was important that certain Burns Philp directors should have faced some form of legal sanction but, as the chairman of ASIC concluded, as I have already said, incompetence is not a crime. ASIC should have at least moved to disqualify or ban these directors from holding office in the future. Alternatively, it could have pursued a civil lawsuit on behalf of aggrieved shareholders. Unfortunately, ASIC is loath to pursue civil litigation.</para><para>The class action being taken by GIO shareholders on botched advice from the GIO board about the merits of the AMP takeover bid should be another textbook case on why companies need to apply good corporate governance practices and on why directors need to be aware of fiduciary duties. In this instance, it is alleged that directors failed to take account of or failed to reveal to the market the significant risk of massive losses in one of their divisions. I welcome the class action in principleâadmittedly for its shock elementâbecause it is important for directors to understand their critical role not only in helping run the company but also in their fiduciary responsibility as representatives of shareholders of the company.</para><para>The board's responsibility, as well as the expert's opinion, becomes particularly critical for companies with a dominant proportion of so-called mum and dad shareholders. They tend not to have access to their own experts nor access to independent information. I would hate to be right on the dangers that might be realised from the government's proposal, because it would mean that the hard-earned savings of Australians could be 
 lost. No matter what sanction you put in place after such a catastrophe, when the money is gone it is gone. The government will not compensate those who would have lost their money. It is also unlikely that the company or its directors would be able to find the money when the company is bankrupt.</para><para>This is an issue which, despite the submissions, many people have got reservations on.

Rogers had effectively written a business judgment rule into the common law by letting directors off the hook over the shenanigans that went on in AWA's foreign exchange transactions, but the Court of Appeal threw it out and put the directors squarely back in the frame.</para><para>What we have here today is an attempt which is not, as is being described in the press release in nice, friendly language, just about making sure that directors are not constrained. Have a look at the words in the legislation: this is overturning the Court of Appeal and returning to Justice Andrew Rogers's position, which was clearly one that was tossed out on appeal. What we are doing is returning to that. That is what Alan Kohler said.</para><para>I would like to make mention of another of Alan Kohler's articles where he talks about what has actually been going on here. He describes it as follows:</para><para>Meanwhile, the company directors' lobby has got the business judgment rule for which it has been agitating for so long. It was felt by them, and agreed by Peter Costello, that the law should give directors a safe harbour from personal liability in the event of breaches of care and diligence if they made an `honest, informed and rational business judgment'âin other words, the old `it was a good idea at the time' defence.</para><para>This is not the Labor Party; this is a commentator who has credibility on these issues because he has studied case law and he has studied the issues. He has made those points.</para><para>I have always struggled to come to terms with the claims that were made before the companies and securities commission when we were told how constrained business had been by this lack of judgment rule. That is not evidenced in the economy at the moment: we have profits booming and the sharemarket increasing. We unfortunately have unemployment going up but all of the conditions are seeing corporate profitability at record highs, yet we are being told that company directors are burdened, weighed down. So you have a situation where, if you examine the rhetoric and what is really happening, you actually see that what is being proposed is a subterfuge to introduce the streaker's defence: it was a good idea at the time. By changing the emphasis and by putting the words in this way in this legislation, it will be nearly impossible to find a director incompetent and to deal with it.</para><para>You have a situation at the moment in GIO where there has been significant allegations of poor management by the board. A court will decide thisâas I have saidâbut, Senator Murray, you have to ask yourself this: if you pass this legislation, will you be helping those GIO shareholders in their class action against their board? Many commentatorsâand I could read you the comments of three, four or five others in this clippings setâhave indicated that in actual fact this is shifting the balance of power between shareholders and company directors. I would put to senators here today that, if you pass this rule, in the future another GIO situation could arise and the capacity of shareholders who have been severely disadvantaged by the conduct of their board will be such that they will not be able to get restitution.</para><para>That is the key test for voting for or against this particular piece of legislation: will you be assisting shareholdersâthe true owners of a companyâand not directors? The directors are appointed and are not the owners in most cases. The directors are there with the responsibility to maximise shareholder value, and in some cases we have directors behaving otherwise, as was proven in the eighties with the Skases and the Bonds. Would you be able to convict Christopher Skase or Alan Bond if you go ahead and vote for these proposals? 
 Would you be able to convict the GIO board? I put to you that you would struggle much harder and that the test would be much harder if you were to vote for this proposal.</para><para>Senator Murray, despite your comments yesterday about me always being on report, I have played contact sport and I have, can I say to you, never ever received a red card and never ever been put on report. I have had the odd yellow card but I have not actually ever been put on report in any circumstances and, despite the wish of some senators on the other side, I intend to keep it that way. But I am surprised at the Democrats' willingness to vote for this. I believe that, if you examine case law and the consequences that are likely to flow from this, you will actually see that you have worked against the interests of shareholders and that this is not something that you should be proud of simply because one groupâand it is a very powerful group, the Australian Institute of Company Directors is a very powerful organisationâhas lobbied extensively. It has pushed for this for years, as has been noted.

That is very useful. But the Labor Party is quite right in isolating this as an area which is deserving of proper debate on the record in this committee of the whole. If you look at the 469 pages of legislation, the nine schedules that we have here and the number of amendments which will enlarge it, you will see this is one of the 
 areas in which there is indeed some controversy. The effect of Senator Conroy's amendment is to abolish the business judgment rule, and we should go through what all that means and how that has been developed as a thought.</para></talk.start><para>Before I do so, I should indicate that the Australian Institute of Company Directors have indeed supported this and have indeed lobbied about it. But to imply that the Democrats were influenced by either their size or their lobbying would be mistaken; we have been influenced by their case. I would point out to you that they are on the record in writing as being very much not our friends. Their miserable and wrongheaded remarks about the Senate's and the Democrats' roles in both Corporations Law and taxation matters have been well noted by us. Frankly, if I were on their board of management, I would want to know why up to this date they have been so remarkably incompetent in interacting with political parties like ours.</para><para>Of course, in making those remarks, I refer to the leadership of the AICD, not company directors at large. I am, quite frankly, unimpressed by their view of the political process and the role of the Senate and of its various functioning parties. But that does not mean to say that I will not accord with their view when I think they have a legitimate case, and that is the role of political parties in this placeâthat is, to assess issues on their merits.</para><para>To return to the business judgment rule, the business judgment rule is a statutory formulation of the position at common law. The courts are loath to review the merits of a decision on a matter of business judgment. In a general sense, the business judgment rule will require the courts to review directors' behaviour in a much more precise manner, and that is one of its virtues. I noted that the shadow minister outlined some American case history. He quite correctly indicated that, where the business judgment rule exists there, more litigation has resulted, which I think may in fact be a useful consequence of thisâin other words, the greater precision of the law may in fact encourage a better focus.</para><para>But we should not escape from the view that the intention is that the proposed provi 
 sion will result in the Corporations Law not only setting out the duty of care and diligence of directors but also providing an explicit safe harbour for directors. If it is the view that every director and every business person has to be regarded with suspicion, obviously none of us in this place will accept thatâcertainly none of the people I know who are familiar with this. If it is the view that you will always find directors who behave appallingly, yes I agree with that. But now directors will know with some certainty that ifâand it is an `if'âthey fulfil the requirements of the new section 180 they will effectively be shielded from liability for any unclear breach, if you like, of their duty of care and diligence.</para><para>I understand that the Labor Party take the view that the business judgment rule will act as some sort of licence for delinquent directors to act in an even more irresponsible manner. I would like to briefly paraphrase the provisions of the new rule and let members of the Senate make up their own minds as to whether they agree that will be the case. The starting point is that a director must exercise his or her powers and discharge his or her duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would if that person was a director of a corporation in the corporations circumstances and occupied the same office and held the same responsibilities within the corporation. That is the primary obligation in relation to directors acting with care and diligence. They have to act with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in their circumstances would. How else would you deal with such a matter? The courts have always struggled with it because you cannot expect directors to go to the extremes of responsibility in every circumstance.</para><para>The business judgment rule says that if you comply with the four criteria that are set out in the rule you will be taken to have acted reasonably. Let us bear in mind that the criteria laid down have a framework and history in common law judgments. What are those criteria? Firstly, you must make the judgment in good faith and for a proper purpose. Secondly, you must not have a material personal interest in the subject matter 
 of the decisionâthat deals with the conflict of interest area. Thirdly, you must inform yourself about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that you reasonably believe to be appropriate. Finally, you must rationally believe that the judgment is in the best interest of the corporation.</para><para>Notwithstanding the comments of Senator Conroy earlier, the business judgment rule does not give directors a free reinâand you did not use these words, but I will paraphrase them in this wayâto act like idiots and squander the resources of companies to the detriment of shareholders. It is the view of the Democrats that it is a subjective judgment as to whether you believe that the obligation of care and diligence, combined with the criteria contained in the business judgment rule, is a satisfactory level of obligation on company directors. The Australian Democrats take the view that the rule strikes an appropriate balance between demanding a reasonable standard of diligence from directors for the protection of shareholders and not imposing such a high standard as to make directors averse to taking any decision which may involve even a hint of risk.</para><para>Senator Conroy quoted the words, I think it was, of Alan Cameron, the head of ASIC, who said that incompetency is not a crime. I laughed when Senator Conroy said that because I just wondered about the 76 of us. There would be a few in here who might now and again be guilty of that themselves. And, frankly, it is not a crime. I have long believedâand people who are attuned to debate in this area of the law would know of my strong feelings on thisâthat in fact the real problem with directors as a class is the nature of their election and how they get to be appointed to their boards. We have heard evidence in the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities about the astonishing difference in the standards of information and presentation even under existing company law in existing company constitutions as to how directors are presented to their shareholders to be elected. Frankly, it is often a gerrymandered and manipulated system.</para><para>If we are going to improve the performance of boards, we really have to as a community 
 of legislators attend to that election issue and fix it up. I have strong feelings on that, as I am sure others in the Senate do. We have to make it more democratic. It is what I call a campaign for the democratisation of companies, that will have the result of making directors more responsible to their shareholders.</para><para>The second leg of enforcing accountability and greater competency on boards is a campaign to get rid of the concept of the unitary board. You cannot allow the unitary board system to continue in this country as long as unitary boards themselves manage issues in which they have clear conflicts of interest. How can boards determine their own remuneration, including share options? By giving people share options you deprive other shareholders of value which might accord to them. I do not have any problem with share options, but I do have a problem with people voting their own share options and their own remunerationâwhich, as we know with certain directors in this country, has resulted in them getting tens of millions of dollars worth of benefits. That is a clear conflict of interest and it arises because it is a unitary board. If you had a binary board structure, as I have previously proposed to the Senate, you could address that issue.</para><para>The other area of concern is the appointment of auditors, valuers, independent experts and so on. The board has a conflict of interest in doing that because they want a certain outcome. There are related party transactions and numerous other areas which I have dwelt on before, and I raise these issues because I think, when we are discussing the issue of directors' standards, Senator Conroy is quite right: this is what this is about and this is why it is controversial. We also have to pay attention to the bigger picture.</para><para>Returning to the amendment before us and to the provisions of the bill, the Democrats have come to the view that this provision, as put in the bill, will actually tighten up and improve accountability in this area, whilst giving appropriate protection for people who must take risks and who must be allowed to exercise a degree of responsible judgment to pursue the interests of their companies. We 
 will oppose your amendmentâwe will find out later whether our judgment is wrong. I do not think the Labor Party is at all wrong to bring up the issue and to seek to expose it and pursue it in the manner they have. I do not disagree with that view. We have, however, taken a different view, and we will support the government on this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>9567</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I respond to some of Senator Murray's comments, I draw to the committee's attention that this has been considered in the other chamber and the minister, Mr Hockey, made the following point:</para></talk.start><para>The fundamental purpose of the business judgment rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their duties, not to insulate the directors from liability.</para><para>Yet what this bill actually does is insulate. It does allow a protectionâan increased protection from what has been there previously. He goes on to say:</para><para>Whilst it is correct that the courts rarely review bona fide business decisions . . . </para><para>So the minister is accepting that the courts have not sought to overstep their mark in this area. I contrast that with a contribution by Senator Campbell of last night. As is sometimes his way, he likes to wax lyrical and exaggerate a situation. He suggests the exact opposite of what the minister has suggested. He said:</para><para>One of the problems with directors, clearly identified by both shareholders and directors, is that they become incredibly risk averse because of court decisions and litigation that try to second guess directors' decisions years, and potentially decades or more, after those decisions have been taken.</para><para>I can only describe Senator Campbell's contribution of last night as an utter furphy and an utter scare campaign designed to influence members of the Senate in our deliberations on this. I repeat: Mr Hockey, the minister, accepts that `Whilst it is correct that the courts rarely review bona fide business decisions'. And that is the case here. Why are we making this change? On the one hand we have the minister, who quite responsibly supports the propositions that I have put forwardâthat courts have very rarely second guessed and have acted prudently and sensib 
 ly in this area. But in his contribution, which I can only describe as inflammatory and scaremongering, he seeks to suggest that in actual fact the courts are running around the whole time second guessing business decisions. This is clearly nothing more than an attempt to influence Senator Brown or perhaps Senator Harradine or perhaps even Senator Murray and the Democrats. I would urge you to ignore the inflammatory suggestions but to go to the heart of what he also said, which was:</para><para>The fundamental purpose of the business judgment rule is to protect the authority of directors in the exercise of their duties, not to insulate the directors from liability.</para><para>That is what they say they are about; that is what the press release is about. But the bill does not do that. The bill does the opposite to what the press release says. The stated intention is not what happens in the actual words of the legislation. Senator Murray, I am sure you were not suggestingâand I am happy for you to clarify thisâthat we take a suspicious view of directors. This is untrue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âNo, I am not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âI accept that. I was sure you would not reflect on the intent and purpose of the debate, because I would be disappointed if you believed that I and members of the Labor Party took the point of view that the starting point is suspicion of directors. I do not think that is the case. What we want to do is not, as you perhaps suggested, to encourage reckless behaviour or to suggest that this will encourage reckless behaviour. What we want to do is make directors accountable for their behaviour. It is not about saying, `This will lead to further reckless behaviour' although many people suggest it will. What I am arguing is the question of accountability. I am arguing that we must be prepared to make the managers of other people's assets and money accountable to the people they are managing it on behalf of.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You raised the point that incompetence is not a crime. Incompetence should not be rewarded. The point I made in the Burns Philp case is that, to this day, the directors who perpetrated the collapse in shareholder value in Burns Philp  have not been brought 
 to account. They can quite easily take up positions on other boards, running other companies and managing other people's money. I have strongly put to ASIC that I believe they failed when they did not seek to at least ban the directors, even if it were for just a year, from holding office. While incompetence may not be a crime, it should not be rewarded. The Burns Philp case is the most dramatic recent case. There are othersâNational Mutual, which no longer exists, had a shareholder value of $6 billion. Within a five- to seven-year period, the shareholder value was reduced to $1 billion. No-one has ever made the directors accountable for that sort of collapse. If you were a BHP shareholder right now, you would want to be asking questions in relation to what has happened to the share price of BHP. Maybe Robert Holmes a Court was right. Maybe what happened in the 1980s, when the Melbourne club got togetherâand the Melbourne club includes some people whom I have spoken about many times hereâto fend off and to protect BHP, and the shareholders were manipulated in the way they were, has come home to roost. They are now starting to close down divisions and sell-off divisions, et cetera.</para><para>So this is not about wanting to encourage reckless behaviour. And even though the government are proposing this legislation, I do not believe they are seeking to encourage reckless behaviour. I simply make the point that it has been stated as a concern that it could encourage reckless behaviour. This is about the accountability of management to owner and not, as some seem to think, that the directors are the owners. They are not. They are in trust to the owners to manage the funds. I am disappointed if the imputation you are making is that what we are seeking to do is to make directors less accountable. What we are seeking to do is to make directors accountable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>9568</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a specific question to ask of the government, and of the people who are contributing to this debate, in relation to a particular interest of mineâthat is, the matter of donations to political parties. I would like 
 to know whether the legislation, as brought to the Senate by the government, is going to increase the obligation of directors making a decision to make a payment to a political party to ensure that it is in the interests of the shareholders. Basic commonsense is that corporations, business entities, do not make donations to political parties without the expectation of a quid pro quo. In fact, it would be against the overall requirements of directors that they act always in the interests of the shareholders if they were to make such a donation without expecting that it was to enhance the return to the shareholders; in other words, without expecting to effect a political influence that was in the interests of the shareholders.</para></talk.start><para>We know that tens of millions of dollars from the corporate sector go into the electoral coffers of political parties in the run-up to every election. It seems to me that we have to face the question: is this money simply a loss to the shareholders? In other words, it is a loss from their returns at the end of the year. Or, alternatively, is it influencing the body politic to get a result? We suspend debate on that sort of matter because there are clear implications for the functioning of a democracy and the so-called independence of political parties in making decisions in the interests of the wider community.</para><para>I think there is clearly an argument that a director who is involved in a donation to a political party where there is not an ostensible or clear return to the shareholders from that donation is not acting in the interests of either the corporation involved or those shareholders and is therefore committing an act against their interests. My belief is that not only should such donations be publicly accountable, as they are, but that the shareholders ought to be consulted and that the directors, when they are making donations to political parties, ought to explain to shareholders in clear and precise terms what the return is going to beâthat is, why it is to the benefit of those shareholders and that corporate entity.</para><para>So the question I pose as far as these provisions are concerned is: will they, or do they, place a requirement on directors that 
 when it comes to political donations there be consultation with the shareholders or, indeed, that there be any clear exposition from the directors involved that this is going to be in the interests of the company they represent?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>9569</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is that the provisions being debated here today make no change whatsoever to directors' responsibilities in relation to that matter.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>9569</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to again emphasise, particularly to the Democrats but also to the government, that both sides of politics have been party to an enormous increase in the number of shareholders in ordinary Australia. Both sides agree that that is a good thing. There are Telstra shareholders, AMP shareholders, Qantas shareholders and Commonwealth Bank shareholders.</para></talk.start><para>Arising out of the AWA and Daniels case, directors are considered fiduciaries as they hold and control other people's money and they are therefore in a position of trust; they do not owe any fiduciary duty to an individual shareholder but rather to the general body of corporates in the form of a company. The courts' directions reflect community concerns that higher standards of vigilance and honesty are required in dealing with other people's money. Kirby P., in Darvall v. North Sydney Brick and Tile Co. Limited (1989), is a classic example of that.</para><para>Commercial judges require higher standards because the community expects this from directors, especially executive directors, when dealing with significant matters. They should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear on the various matters that come before them. The key here is that the independent judgment is not reflected in the business judgment rule. This is the nub of the issue. When the government say they are codifyingâthat they are just seeking to clarifyâthey are removing from case law the critical question of independent judgment, and that is why the Labor Party is so concerned 
 about this issue. The role of directors is to manage other people's money; it is not to manage their own. They are given a trust. Whether the government's press release is right or whether the government's legislation is right, the key test is the test of independent judgment, and it is not in the business judgment rule.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>9570</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn response to my earlier submission about political donations being made on behalf of corporations by directors, Senator Campbell said on behalf of the government that this legislation will not alter the responsibility of directors in relation to that matter.

What we are dealing with is the director or other officer of a corporation making a business judgmentâand that of course involves the finances of any corporationâin good faith, that they do not have a personal material interest, and so on. Quite clearly, if a corporation is handing across $1 million to a political party, that is a major business decision. I ask Senator Campbell to address himself to these provisions. Is he saying that they will not affect the decision of a director of a corporation, when that director does make a donation on behalf of the corporation which can involve millions of dollars? Of course it does.</para></talk.start><para>Yes, there are other pieces of legislation dealing with political donations, but that is not the point I am making. The point I am making is that the decision on those donations is made by directors, and it has to be in the interests of the shareholders. I ask the minister: in this specific matter, what obligations will there be on directors, if these 
 provisions are to be satisfactory, to ensure that when donations are made to political parties they are in the best interests of the shareholders? I would think it would require consultation with the shareholders. Is there provision here for such consultation? If not, why not? Can the minister say how any director acting in the interests of a corporation could make a political donation without weighing up the pros and cons of the effect of that political donation and the bearing it will have on the fortunes of the corporation and therefore the shareholders' interests?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>9570</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am wondering whether Senator Campbell is going to respond.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âI've already answered the question.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âYou've had your answer, Senator Brown; I didn't notice it, but you have had it!

I was hoping for a lengthier answer. I am sure Senator Brown has noticed that there are some proposals on the table at the moment to make trade unions more accountable for how they make political donations. I have always been open-minded about it, as many are, in terms of accountability to their membership. I am surprised that Senator Campbell does not want to respond in any greater detail to Senator Brown. The government try to pretend that they have a balance in their current proposals between donations from a union and a peak employer group, as if they are the same. I would have thought the more direct comparison is a company and a trade union, not a peak employer group.</para></talk.start><para>I am not familiar with many peak employer groups that make direct donationsâperhaps in kind by doing some intellectual work for them, and they need a lot of that. Perhaps that happens. But to try and fudge the question as blatantly as the government has regarding a trade union making donations but not deal with the question of corporate donations is a valid concern. I am disappointed that Senator 
 Campbell is not prepared to enter into discussion with you on that, Senator Brown. I support you in your pursuit of this issue because the hypocrisy and double standard that I have already alluded to earlier today in relation to the takeover panel and independent umpires when it suits the government for its mates but not in the industrial system is again evident in what it is seeking to do and in regard to the points that you are making today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>9571</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the point which Senator Brown has raised, I indicate for the record that the Australian Democrats in the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters, in its report on the 1996 election, recommended that if disclosure by companies and by unions were to be increased that should be common to all organisations, whether trusts, partnerships, unions or corporations in terms of political donations. The point is made that if you make donations on behalf of others, whether they be members of a union, a trust or a partnership or owners of a company, you should do so on the basis of a policy and on the basis of approval. That is essentially the point: those who own or participate in or belong to organisations, companies, trusts or partnerships should have a say in making sure that the policy is worth their approval.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown, if you have an interest in this matter, you should go back over some of the debates and the 1996 report. There is a tax bill that will be dealing with political donations, and all disclosure provisions are covered in the Electoral Act. I am not sure that this necessarily is the right act to deal with it. But we have previously indicated that far better policies need to prevail in all organisations, unions or otherwise, and that the question of disclosure and improvement in disclosure levels should be dealt with through the 1918 Commonwealth Electoral ActâI cannot find the right terminology for that act, but you know the one I am referring toârather than through general devices such as the Corporations Law. On the tax law side it relates to the size and nature of donations. But disclosure should be specifically dealt with. Senator Brown, I sit on the electoral

That is a constructive contribution. I will be making my submission to the parliament, but it is awesome that the government goes silent on this matter. I will tell you why. It is indefensible that corporations are making donations of hundreds of thousands, and over the years millions and tens of millions, of dollars to the big political parties with no reference at all to the shareholders. You do not have to be a mathematician to work out that that money which goes to the political parties does not go to the profit line and therefore is taken from the interests of the shareholders, unless you can show a greater interest accruing to the shareholders through the political influence which the donation system levies. In my view, that system is corrupt. It therefore needs to be brought to order.</para></talk.start><para>The government has flagged legislation which will make unions and peak employer groupsâpresumably like the National Association of Forest Industries, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and so onâaccountable to their membership when they make political donations. But these are not the big political donors. The big political donors are the corporations themselves. So we have double standards where the government is saying, `We want to shelter the corporations, which make millions of dollars of donations into our coffers, from having to explain themselves to shareholders.' The point I make is that this legislation is a proper place to be debating this matter. I will move amendments when the government legislation comes into 
 this place to make unions accountable and to ensure that corporations are accountable and that there are no further donations made to any political party without the matter having been referred to shareholders.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âBeforehand?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âBeforehand, you are right.

We need to face up to itâthose who want to defend the system as it is or those of us who feel we can do better to support changes to increase accountability. I believe ultimately we should move away from a donation system to political parties because donations are made with the clear intention of levying political effect and I do not think we should be able to buy political favour.

 as chair of the Senate legislation committee which deals with the arts, I would like to pay a tribute to Morris West, who died at his desk in Sydney last Saturday evening. Morris West was perhaps Australia's most successful storyteller. He wrote 26 books and three plays, selling over 60 million copies worldwide, which were translated into 27 languages. Several of his works were turned into films, including <inline font-style="italic">The Devil's Advocate</inline>  and <inline font-style="italic">The Shoes of the Fisherman</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Morris West was educated at Christian Brothers College in St Kilda and Melbourne University. He joined Christian Brothers in 1933 as a schoolteacher and left after 12 years before taking vows to become a priest. Morris West served in World War II and, following this, he was press secretary to Billy Hughes for a short time in the parliament before working in radio and then moving to Italy, where he further developed his writing skills.</para><para>West acquired a great wealth of knowledge and perspective from his variety of experiences, focusing largely on social issues of a moral and religious nature. The Catholic Church remained a powerful factor in Morris West's life and was almost always an important part of the focus of his books, in which he very often portrayed the political intrigue of the inner circles of the Catholic Church. Novelist and critic Laurie Clancy said that West was lucid on issues affecting the Vatican and the papacy's involvement in political affairs.</para><para>Many of West's novels anticipated contemporary political events such as <inline font-style="italic">The Ambassador</inline> in 1965, which dealt with the conflict in Vietnam, <inline font-style="italic">The Tower of Babel</inline>, which was a story of the politics of the Middle East and was published immediately after the Six-Day War, and <inline font-style="italic">The Salamander</inline>, which dealt with the renewal of Italian fascism in the early 1970s. More recently in <inline font-style="italic">Eminence</inline>, published in 1998, West predicted that Cardinal Carlo Martini of Milan will be the next pope. We will have to see whether or not that prediction proves to be correct.</para><para>Morris West will be remembered for his religious beliefs and strong views, which influenced many Australians, and, in his own words, as `a man who always carried his 
 country with him'. He was always an Australian and took an Australian point of view about the world around him. He was passionate about self-expression and the pursuit of what individuals believed in. His analysis of world events and social change captured his readers. West's themes encompassed political advice in the context of power, accountability and leadership, and he encouraged public debate on issues of democracy, leadership and the like. In recording West's passing, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last Monday quoted Edmund Campion, who wrote:</para><para>In his fiction West had been particularly interested in people's power over each other and the tendency of power to corrupt; in both church and state he stood for the rights of the individual voice of conscience . . . He was a committed believer and wanted to assert the rights of a member of the household to speak to the household. And what he spoke of was a profound normal belief in Christian religion, a belief in sacraments, in mass, in prayers and the Bible.</para><para>The article continued:</para><para>Campion suggested that the prescience of some of his fiction could have originated with his wide circle of contacts. His apartment in Rome was famous for the people you might meet there. There would be politicians, cardinals, newspaper commentators, diplomats, US business people and film people. It must point to the fact that he was very engaged with lifeâtuned into what was happening in the world.</para><para>Morris West was the recipient of a number of accolades and awards, including the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1960; the Royal Society of Literature Heinemann Award, also in 1960; the Dag Hammarskjold Prize in 1978; and the Universe Literary Prize in 1981. He was awarded an AM in 1985 and was elevated to an AO in 1996 for his services to literature.</para><para>For me personally, Morris West was the herald of Christmas. This was because his books almost always appeared just before Christmas and, knowing how much I enjoyed the political intrigue and conflicts between idealism and pragmatism which his plots embodied, I was always given a Morris West book for Christmas by my family. Morris West brought his ideas to the masses, not only through his literary works but in speeches, lectures, presentations and work 
 shops to businessmen, universities and literary groups. He assisted in founding the Australian Society of Authorsâa writers watchdog organisationâand acted in various roles on the executive of that organisation.</para><para>This week the Prime Minister referred to Morris West as the `foremost Australian novelist of his time'. There is no doubt that Morris West was a great Australian who will be warmly remembered in the hearts of many around the world and, I am sure, respected by future generations who come to read his works. Although Morris West the man is no longer with us, the tales of Morris West the storyteller will live on long into the future. So on behalf of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee, I would like to offer condolences to the West family and commend Morris West for his great contribution to the discourse on ideas and issues of the latter part of the 20th century.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>West, Mr Morris</title><title>Republic Referendum</title><page.no>9575</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>9575</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I begin my remarks today on the issue I want to discuss, I endorse the comments made by Senator Eggleston. As has been recognised, it is unfortunate that Morris West's contribution to Australian literature and indeed to literature generally has not been as well recognised as it should be, particularly in his own country. I am sure that that will be corrected in the future. My recollections from my university studies are that it was very rare that Morris West ever managed to get into the academic lists of study, despite his undoubted literary skills. In terms of what I want to speak about today, it is also relevant to note, as Senator Eggleston did, that one of the great characteristics of Morris West was his keen intellect and his ability to argue a case. He was very much a person who was prepared to argue his case intelligently with reason and passion.</para></talk.start><para>That leads me to what I wanted to address todayâthe issue of the republic. It is unfortunate that as the polling day on 6 November approaches we are seeing from some of those involved in the no case a resort to outrageous 
 scaremongering, downright lies and misinformation in their attempt to prevent the referendum from succeeding. I will detail that in a moment.</para><para>Almost 100 years ago, Australia took its first steps to become an independent nation. At that time, the British Empire was still in existence. Indeed, yesterday was the 100th anniversary of the commitment of Australian troops to the Boer War in Southern Africa, a war at that time being fought by the Empire against the Afrikaners. Today the British Empire has long since ceased to exist. The United Kingdom is now firmly politically and economically entrenched within the European Union. Its armed forces no longer maintain bases to keep the peace east of Suez and its navy no longer patrols the seas. Its focus is clearly upon Europe and really not at all upon this region of the world.</para><para>On 6 November we have an opportunity to complete the process towards true independence. We have an opportunity to finally have our own head of state rather than the head of state of another countryâa head of state who lives 20,000 kilometres away in Buckingham Palace. When Australia was in the process of moving to independenceâultimately achieved in 1901âthere were those who opposed it. There were those who predicted dire consequences for the colony as it then was. The same is true today. However, I venture to say that whereas rational argument was put forward in those days what we are seeing today is, as I said earlier, downright scaremongering and deliberate lies, distortions and misinformation. As polling day approaches, the predictions of doom and destructionâof the end of the Australian political and social way of life as we know itâhave become even more bizarre and more outrageous. It seems that no lie and no fanciful prediction is too outrageous to make if it will help to defeat the referendum. Deliberate scaremongering rather than reasoned debate has become the monarchists' main strategy as polling day approaches.</para><para>I want to refute some of those false and misleading arguments advanced by those associated with the no case. Firstly, let me deal with that discredited argument, put for 
 ward by Kerry Jones initially and still being argued by people such as Sir David Smithâthat the Queen is not really our head of state; that the Governor-General is our head of state. As we know, that is simply not true. Many on the monarchists' side understand that but there are those such as Sir David Smith who are still advancing it. One wonders why. Why do they resort to such lies and such misinformation to support their case? I ask the question: who does Sir David Smith believe invested him with his knighthood? Who was responsible for his knighthood? It was our head of state, the Queen. Who is opening the Olympic Games? It should be our head of state, the Queen, according to Olympic tradition. But because she is the Queen of England, the Olympic committee for the first time has approved someone other than a head of stateâa Prime Ministerâto open the Olympic Games. Special arrangements have had to be made for Australia because of this ridiculous situation we have whereby our head of state is not an Australian.</para><para>I interpose here to note that the Prime Minister, avowed monarchist as he is, does not mind taking the job on, accepting the glory and accepting the opportunity to appear on the world stage by opening the Olympics. It is clear that he can be flexible with respect to our constitutional arrangements when it suits him. For instance, he has put forward his own preamble which, following negotiations with the Democrats, is now to go forward to the people on the same day in the referendum. We are supporting that change in the preamble. Albeit a second-best effort, it does represent a modernising of the preamble attached to the Constitution. It is bringing Australia up to date by recognising such things as a prior relationship between the Aboriginals and this continent. The Prime Minister is prepared to modernise the Constitution in that respect, but he is not prepared to do what is fundamentally important and necessary: that is, to allow an Australian to become our head of state.</para><para>Another argument being advanced is that a constitutional monarchy is better than a republic. I noted an article in the paper today by Sir James Hardy who stated this:</para><para>As you can imagine, as a `knight of the realm', I will be voting for the status quo.</para><para>The word president scares me. Save for the USA, France and the recent President Mandela of South Africa, most republics of the world, whether in central and South America, Asia, Africa or eastern Europe, appear to be pretty unhappy regimes.</para><para>Monarchies on the other hand, for example, Japan, Thailand, Belgium, Holland and the Nordic countries, seem far more settled.</para><para>This argument is advanced by people on the monarchists' side that constitutional monarchies are good, republics are bad. That again is scaremongering and it is a distortion of history. Indeed, many republics have come about because of the problems of monarchies. Despotic, dynastic, aristocratic rulers in many countries have been replaced by republican regimes or governments. Some have worked, some have not. The great democracies of the worldâfor instance the United States and Franceâdemonstrate that republics can work. Equally there have been others that have not. Such a simplistic argument is not only wrong, it also demeans the entire debate because it ignores the many influences that impact upon systems of government.</para><para>This argument has reached its most extreme form in the views expressed by some members of the government who refer to the Weimar Republic in Germany and how that was supposed to have led to the rise of Hitler. They suggest that moving to an Australian head of state will somehow bring doom and destruction and a dictator in as president. Such a view is insulting to the intelligence of the Australian people. It suggests that we cannot cope with change, even though we have done so consistently throughout the last 100 years. It demonstrates the paucity of the monarchists' case.</para><para>It also ignores particularly the history of England itself. The history of the British monarchy, even in this century, has not been without great controversy. There are those, for instance, such as Geoffrey Blainey, the noted historian, and Bronwyn Bishop, a government minister, who claim that having the Queen of England is a guarantee of stability. If that is the case, I invite them to look, for instance, at the constitutional history of England. They only have to go back, as I have pointed out 
 before, to 1936 and what happened then when the King of England, Edward VIII, became king upon the death of his father and was ultimately forced to abdicate his office. He was never crowned. Why? Because he wanted to marry a divorced American woman, Wallis Simpson, and the British parliament, the political leaders of the day and even the Church of England said to Edward VIII, `You cannot. You will have to choose between the throne and marriage to a divorced woman.'  Ultimately he was forced to abdicate. That crisis went on for an entire year in England. Whilst it may now be distant in the memories of peopleâcertainly I was not alive thenâyou only have to read the history to find out that the monarchy in England came very close to collapse at that time.</para><para>There are two points to noteâfirstly, England itself, the home of the constitutional monarchy and the Westminster system, has not been free of its own constitutional upheaval. Secondly, and I think more importantly, at that time Australia had to sit by and watch from the sideline while others in another country debated and argued about who would be the head of state of England and therefore the head of state of Australia. It is not scaremongering to suggest that this situation might actually arise in the not too distant future if Charles III becomes the King of England.</para><para>It is also important to note some features of the position of the monarch in England. Geoffrey Blainey recently said:</para><para>. . . under the present system the Prime Minister of Australia cannot dismiss the head of state. In short, the Prime Minister cannot dismiss the Queen.</para><para>Well, that is true in Australia. But, interestingly, it is not true in England. In England, the monarch is not above the rule or the law of parliament. Again, the history of England shows that. One can go back to Magna Carta, but more particularly to the Act of Settlement of 1701, which sets out and confines the role of the monarch and the rules of succession of the English monarch. As the noted philosopher Walter Bagehot said in 1867, even the Queen is not above the laws of parliament. He stated:</para><para>The Queen cannot exercise the power of veto over bills put forward by the parliament. She must sign her own death warrant if the two houses unanimously send it up to her.</para><para>Why do I resort to this historical argument? Because it demonstrates that in England the Queen has a different status compared to the situation in Australia; that is, the parliament itself can ultimately, if it so decides, abolish the monarchy. So anyone who suggests that somehow the existence of a constitutional monarchy is the guarantee of continuous stable government in this country is really distorting constitutional law and historical fact.</para><para>I go back to Sir James Hardy's comments earlier about the supposed stability of monarchies around the world. Even if one accepts, as I do, that countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan today and a number of others that have monarchies, or indeed constitutional monarchies, are stable countries, there is one interesting feature about all of those monarchies. Each one of those countries, except for the countries inside the British Commonwealth, have their own head of state. The King and Queen of Belgium are Belgians. The monarch of Denmark is a Dane. In Australia, the head of state is not an Australian. It is Queen Elizabeth II, an Englishwoman. I find it ironic that, as was proved recently by the High Court, Australians need to be Australian citizens and renounce citizenship to another country to be members of this parliament and ultimately become Prime Minister. The Queen and members of the royal family can never aspire to that, because they are not Australian citizens. Ironically, while an Australian can become a member of parliament, can become prime minister or can hold public office in this country as an Australian citizen, that same person cannot currently become our head of state. That is the change we need on 6 November.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Alston, Senator Richard: Misrepresentation</title><title>Genetic Privacy</title><page.no>9577</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>9577</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commend Senator 
 Forshaw on his speech. As a member of the yes committee, I have been absolutely astounded by some of the scaremongering and the inappropriate tactics that have been used and have emanated from the no campaign. Indeed, yesterday I attended a Property Council of Australia function, a debate involving the heads of the yes and no committees, and I was astounded to hear Kerry Jones's retort to Malcolm Turnbull when he said that our head of state was a foreigner and lived overseas. She suggested that Sir William Deane might be offended to be described as a foreigner. This persistence that our head of state is somehow located in Australia, is an Australian and living in the Governor-General's quarters is quite extraordinary. Similarly, I wish to correct a statement that was made in public yesterday by Ms Jones. She suggested that eminent lawyer George Winterton had critiqued the model and suggested it had flawsâthat is trueâand that he would not be voting for this model. That is untrue. I think it is completely outrageous that that was put on record at such a prominent function in Sydney yesterday.</para></talk.start><para>Today I wish to refer to two matters. The first is the issue of genetic privacy. Actually, before that I will put on record the second matter. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to two misrepresentations in this place by Senator Richard Alston on 30 September 1999. Both these misrepresentations were made during the minister's speech to the notice of motion moved jointly by myself and Senator Bishop regarding the Internet censorship legislation. The first misrepresentation relates to the following statement made during that debate by the minister. He said:</para><para>The only people who raised itâ</para><para>That is, Internet censorship legislationâ-</para><para>with me on that visit were Yahoo who thought it was a good idea.</para><para>In fact, Yahoo made statements contradicting this when the minister first suggested that they supported the government's Internet censorship legislation.</para><para>The following quote from Mr Tony Faure, the general manager of Yahoo Australia, was carried by the Australian Personal Computer News Wire on 7 June 1999. I quote:</para><para>Yahoo Vice-President Heather Killen spoke to the minister. (However), as a matter of interest, neither she or the company endorsed it or not endorsed it.</para><para>Another quote from the same man, Tony Faure, confirmed this. He said:</para><para>Let me tell anyone who might be under the impression that we endorse the bill that we certainly do not.</para><para>The second misrepresentation relates to the position of Lotus and its CEO, Jeff Papows. The minister quoted Mr Papows as having endorsed content regulation. The minister made the following statement to the Senate:</para><para>Hisâ</para><para>Meaning Jeff Papows'-</para><para>answer was,`Industry has no issue with online content regulation. The industry endorses content regulation.'</para><para>Well, Mr Acting Deputy President, this has been contradicted by Mr Bryan Simmons, Lotus Vice-President of Worldwide Corporate Communications, who has said that the company did not:</para><para>`in any way regulate the distribution methods used by our customers based on the content of the material, or suggest or dictate these to governments.'</para><para>Bryan Simmons went on to add the following:</para><para>Jeff's comments were meant only to communicate deference to the government's sphere of sovereignty, not support any government's particular policies.</para><para>I think these are serious matters that need a response as a matter of urgency from the minister. It has been widely debated online and of course in various Internet industry circles, the fact that the minister has repeatedly now not only contradicted or misrepresented statements made by company officials, but that he has done so at least on one occasion in this place and most recently, of course, in the debate that we had on that joint notice of motion.</para><para>The second matter I wish to refer to today is essentially to update the Senate on the ongoing debate about genetic privacy and non-discrimination. Last year I introduced the Genetic Privacy and Non-Discrimination Bill. This was introduced, if you like, as a primer for debate about the introduction of genetic technology into our community. To date this technology has been introduced without the 
 kind of community debate that every new technology should get. Of course, the bill was quite rightly referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and a report was tabled on 30 March this year.</para><para>I believe the report was a significant outcome, certainly for the debate but legislatively, because it showed the diversity of views in the broader community and the breadth of application of this new technology to our lives. Perhaps even better, the government has acknowledged the need to examine genetic discrimination as a new form of discrimination in Australia. The Attorney-General has also instructed the Privacy Commissioner to undertake a review of health information practices and the government has initiated the links with other states and territories to discuss genetic privacy. These are welcome developments. However, the decision by this government to adopt a self-regulatory approach to privacy generally through the so-called light touch regulation and the limited scope of the Privacy Commissioner's health information review, which will not consider all genetic information, leaves us with some stark choices in Australia. 	The government's generic privacy approach is really directed to personal information privacy and protects only the privacy of the information. My proposal instead attaches privacy and due process to the genetic sample collected from the individual and makes sure its privacy is intimately linked with consent, with authorisation, ownership and genetic counselling. Perhaps the most concerning aspect of the government's approach is that because not all genetic information is health information, there is a great likelihood that different self-regulating sectors will develop inconsistent privacy codes. For example, an insurance company collecting non-health genetic information might apply a different standard from an employer and a different standard again from a bank and a hospital or a local doctor.</para><para>Under the government's proposal there is a very great chance different standards will apply and that is ironic, because that was the reason given by this government initially for not introducing a privacy regime.</para><para>Of course, the other claim we saw in submissions to the committee was that legislation was not necessary. I certainly presented a range of examples in the report to the committee on behalf of the Democrats, including a United States survey of access to stored heel prick screening blood samples by third parties which showed a willingness to release the cards to insurance companies, employers and law enforcement agencies, quite often just because they were asked for the information.</para><para>This concern was confirmed in a submission which dealt with the same issue in Australia, where heel prick samples were taken and stored. The processes followed by that institution holding the cards were not satisfactory and highlighted the need for regulation so that we can all be sure that our genetic information is safe.</para><para>A recent survey of quality assurance in genetic testing laboratories just adds to the weight of evidence that we need effective regulation. This survey was conducted by Margaret McGovern and others from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. They surveyed laboratories conducting genetic tests to determine what tests were being done and the standards which were being applied. Their findings are reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association</inline>. They were quite a major surprise and strongly reinforced how urgently we need to review genetic technology to make sure we are getting only benefits from this technology.</para><para>The survey found that the number of genetic tests were increasing at a rate of approximately 30 per cent per year over 1994, 1995 and 1996. Some 70 per cent offered genetic counselling through a counsellor employed by the laboratory, or through an affiliation of the laboratory, which left 30 per cent with no access to genetic counselling. In 45 per cent of the laboratories, some form of informed consent was required and 69 per cent had a written confidentiality policy. Sadly, this means that more than half the laboratories did not require some form of informed consent 
 and approximately 30 per cent had no written privacy policy.</para><para>Perhaps the most chilling finding was that only six per cent of laboratories which required the informed consent of the already low number would reject a sample if it did not have the informed consent. Clearly, a preference was shown for people who were not involved in signing away or being involved in a privacy regime.</para><para>The authors concluded these findings showed a variable set of policies for counselling, privacy and informed consent. They also said that the low levels of informed consent were troubling because of the potential for pre-symptomatic and predisposition testing and that this posed `a substantial risk to patients in terms of genetic discrimination'.</para><para>I accept that these figures are from the United States and of course that the Australian experience is likely to be different because of our different health systems and the way our health systems operate. Despite this, this report is concerning and it confirms that we need to have similar studies in Australia. Without these studies, we should apply the precautionary principle and we should be adopting regulatory measures which will make sure that the basics of genetic technology are satisfied. This includes, at the minimum, an informed consent, privacy and counselling. These are issues that are being dealt with in the Genetic Privacy and Non-Discrimination Bill that we have tabled and merely touched on or outside the scope of the government's self-regulatory approach.</para><para>I also note the release by the National Health and Medical Research Council of its latest draft guidelines under section 95 of the Privacy Act for privacy in research. This is a welcome review. However, we need to recognise that these guidelines have limited application under the Privacy Act and under the law and that the Privacy Act itself has quite a limited operation. Effectively the Privacy Act and these guidelines only apply to Commonwealth agencies and any researchers using information for research provided by the Commonwealth. The NHMRC claims these guidelines provide a framework for all researchâthat is certainly trueâbut they do not 
 provide enforceable laws for most research institutions in Australia, where there is effectively no regulation.</para><para>Quoting the press release from the NHMRC from 17 August this year, when these guidelines were first released, it sums up my views entirely and confirms the need for legislation which deals comprehensively with genetic privacy and non-discrimination. The press release reads:</para><para>Privacy is a basic human right. Australians expect their rights to be recognised and protected.</para><para>I agree whole-heartedly. I look forward to seeing effective legislation to guarantee that recognition and protection.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Food Marketing</title><page.no>9580</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>9580</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today in this debate to make reference to a very important report which was prepared by the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. The title of the report is <inline font-style="italic">Fair Market or Market Failure?</inline> . I particularly want to underline some of the comments made by my Democrat colleague Senator Andrew Murray in his minority report as part of the major report. I want to put within the context of the comments of Senator Murray some disturbing trends in fresh fruit and vegetable marketing in Brisbane, particularly the wholesale markets at Rocklea. I refer to the decline in the amount of fruit and vegies going through that market and in some ways a crisis in the wholesale market in those central markets in Brisbane.</para></talk.start><para>What I want to do is show that the things that Senator Murray says in his minority report to the major report in fact reinforce claims that were made to me by wholesalers at those markets. I have not yet been able to completely verify those claims, but I think they are so serious that in fact they ought to be reported here and they should be taken very seriously indeed.</para><para>A couple of weeks ago I visited the Brisbane markets at the request of Mark Griffiths and a number of other wholesalers who met with me for a couple of hours. They raised serious questions about market distortions in both the wholesale as well as the retail market for fresh fruit and vegetables in Queensland.</para><para>But let me return for a moment to the joint committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Fair Market or Market Failure?</inline>. In that report Senator Murray made some comments, particularly under the heading `A Viable Independent Retail Sector', and I quote some of his remarks:</para><para>In designing competition policy we have to determine a set of values and principles which should guide our laws and behaviour. First amongst these should be the recognition that monopolies or oligopolies inherently contain within them a capacity for the abuse of market power, and should usually be resisted where they emerge, or monitored where they already exist. Therefore a situation such as we have in the Australian supermarket industry, where an oligopoly is present, has to be acted upon.</para><para>Secondly, we must acknowledge that a viable and thriving independent sector in the retail industry is desirable of itself and that it has an economic and social value that should not be lost.</para><para>In retailing, this independent sector is most at threat in Australia in the supermarket sector, where the critical mass essential to its survival is under threat. However, the trend is also emerging in non-supermarket retail sectors, and that problem needs to be addressed to prevent such crises emerging there too.</para><para>Certainly I would underline what Senator Murray said in that minority report in relation to the Brisbane fruit and vegetable market.</para><para>Senator Murray made a recommendation that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission be required to include in its considerations this particular aspect, and that is to ensure the preservation of a viable independent sector in retailing.</para><para>The people that I spoke to at the Brisbane markets made some very serious claims about that threat, a threat not only to the retail sector in the marketing of fruit and vegetables, but also in the wholesale sector. Their experience confirms that the area of retailing is in fact under serious threat. In the evidence given to me, the following claims were made: first, that fruit and vegetable prices have always been determined by supply and demand. Secondly, penetration of the market by the major supermarkets has distorted market processes and depressed returns to growers.</para><para>Supermarket dominance has the following effects: first, the distortion of pricesâthe depression of prices by not participating on a 
 daily basis in the marketplace on many selected lines, hence giving poor returns to farmers and then farmers are lost to the industry. Secondly, the dislocation of the central business districts in many small to medium country towns. Thirdly, gluts are not resolved by naturally occurring market forces and if they are ever cleared it is because of direct buying with selected growers. These claims need to be verified, but they are serious and they should be tested further.</para><para>Senator Murray also commented on the issue of predatory pricing and trading hours. Again I would like to quote from the report that he made. He said this about predatory pricing:</para><para>The Committee received significant evidence as to the difficulty in bringing a successful action under section 46, (which deals with misusing market power) for predatory pricing.</para><para>That is section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. Senator Murray continued:</para><para>Witnesses consistently complained of the difficulty in proving predatory pricing. . . I would like to reiterate the comments of Professor Allan Fels, Chairman of the ACCC, on the merits of the reversed onus of proof test. Professor Fels said:</para><para>`There may be scope for some further strengthening of section 46 in terms of that kind of thing; that, if the effect can be shown, then there is a reverse onus of proof on purpose. That would essentially keep it to purpose. There is a problem at the moment with the test in that the Commission or private litigants have to embark upon a cops and robbers type search for purpose in particular cases. They are just not going to succeed in that, even though one has a fair idea that the purpose is anti-competitive. So there is a case for reversing the onus without departing from the underlying notion that, in the end, it would be a purpose test.'</para><para>It is interesting that Senator Murray, again in his minority report, recommended along the lines suggested by Professor Fels that the Trade Practices Act should be revisited and section 46 should indeed be strengthened so that a reverse onus of proof test should be possible.</para><para>On the issue of trading hours, Senator Murray also had comments to make and I must say that many of the comments of Senator Murray were supported by the major report, but were not put in as strong terms as those of Senator Murray. He says:</para><para>The Committee received a substantial amount of evidence in relation to the deregulation of trading hours. This issue has played a major role in making the independent sector vulnerable and less viable. The theme was that small independent retailers are being pushed out of the grocery retailing market as the majors extend their trading hours and the public gravitate towards the majors and away from small independents.</para><para>What is more, the Majors have been leaders in the lobbying campaign for deregulated trading hours, expressed at its most extreme by the push for twenty-four hour seven day trading.</para><para>There is also a considerable social impact to the extent that owner/operators of independent grocers are forced to maintain longer hours just to keep up with the major retailers.</para><para>. . . 		 . . . 		 . . . </para><para>State governments need to keep a much greater account of the social and economic impacts of deregulated trading hours than has previously occurred.</para><para>In his report Senator Murray commends the Western Australian state government as having been able to regulate the market much more to the satisfaction of all and certainly to the enhancement of competition in that state.</para><para>With regard to the Brisbane markets, evidence was given that the effects of predatory pricing and longer trading hours have in fact been detrimental. The wholesalers told me in a number of bits of evidence that they gave me that these are very serious issues. They claimed that the supermarkets were deliberate in the actions they had taken. The wholesalers at the markets said that deregulation of trading hours, where small and family owned businesses cannot stay open because of the expense, seems to be a deliberate strategy by the major supermarkets.</para><para>On predatory pricing, I was told that prices change from store to store to suit the competition they face. That is, in a shopping centre where there is not an individually owned fruit shop or butcher et cetera, the prices will be high, but where there are small competitors, then Coles and Woolworths will in fact take on those small retailers but, interestingly enough, they do not take on each other. The claim was made to me that this is evidence of collusion.</para><para>So these are issues that I think underline the importance of the <inline font-style="italic">Fair Market or Market 
 Failure? </inline>report. It is about time we heard the government's response to that report, because it is a very urgent matter indeed.</para><para>Claims were also made to me by wholesalers at the Brisbane markets that the bypassing of the central market in Brisbane by the major supermarket chains is also detrimental to fair trading as it is to the farmers who become the victims, very often, in a kind of a war between farmers and the major supermarkets. The evidence given to me, if I could just quote from this document, is that bypassing central markets, by dealing directly with farmers for fruit and vegetables, in a lot of cases means that growers send less desirable size produce and then have it rejected. This practice gives false prices and generally holds market prices down.</para><para>They go on to say that the practice of orchestrating gluts in the market means two things: supermarkets make an exorbitant profit when they are able to manipulate the market in this way. Also, they do not help to reduce oversupply by keeping market price low; rather, the index they use for growers is based on market averages and then they manipulate those averages.</para><para>These are some of the issues that were presented to me in underlining the importance of the report which was made by the joint committee. The claim also was made that there is a lot of vertical integration going on. Growers have been encouraged to expand and absorb smaller farms and the claim was that this is because it is much easier to manipulate the fewer and fewer growers and make them produce to the specifications of the supermarket, but always at the growers' expense. The claim was that there is a feeling of helplessness, both on the part of wholesalers and of farmers, as the supermarkets become more and more dominant. The wholesalers felt they were getting little help from government and that the supermarkets dominate all who come under their influence, including landlords and suppliers, et cetera.</para><para>I want to underlineâI notice I am running out of time and I will perhaps need to return to thisâthat I tried to get some confirmation of what has been happening. I approached Trevor Brewer from Market Information 
 Systems, which operates out of the Brisbane markets, and I will seek from him more of the statistical evidence to show one way or the other what is happening, but as yet I have not been able to get that evidence.</para><para>I urge the government to respond to the joint committee report, <inline font-style="italic">Fair Market or Market Failure?</inline>, as soon as possible and I commend my colleague Andrew Murray on the excellence of the minority report that he tabled as part of the major study.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Republic: Role of the Senate</title><page.no>9583</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>9583</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make some remarks today about the role of the Senate under the proposed change to a republic, which will be voted on by our fellow citizens on 6 November. It is not a matter that has been discussed in the media. I have tried to alert the media to the significant change to the role of the Senate which is involved in the republican model that is to be put to the people, but as Professor Flint was reported as saying in this morning's press, it is very difficult to have any argument in relation to the referendum put that supports the no case in most of Australia's major metropolitan daily newspapers. That is very unfortunate, but for those of us who feel strongly that the model that is proposed is a seriously flawed one, at best it means that we have to continue to put our case where we can.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the wiping out of the role of the Senate in this republican model, there is no better place to discuss that impact of the flawed republican model than here in one of the greatest political and democratic institutions ever put on this earthâa great Australian institution, a great part of Australia's very own Australian-designed and democratically voted upon institutions, put in place by our great founding fathers. That institution, the Senate, represents the states. In its design by our founding fathers and in its years of operation ever since and coming up to its centenary, it has been able to ensure a different plurality, a different representation of the Australian people's democratic rights. It has 
 significant powers to overturn decisions of governments, to overturn decisions of the House of Representatives, and to do so on a basis that represents the states of Australia with equal numbersâa very powerful institution with significant powers.</para><para>Yet when we come to the republican model, we find that senators will indeed have a right to vote on a nomination to be made by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. We will have the privilege of walking across to the other chamber and casting our votesânot really a vote in the way most people would expect. Most would expect that a democratic vote in relation to electing a President would perhaps be a choice of candidates, as in most other elections in the free world, but this is effectively a rubber-stamp of a decision that has been made by two politiciansâspecifically the Prime Minister and, through the seconding of the motion, the Leader of the Opposition. So, in fact, it is a decision of two politicians, who for their own political power rely on as little as 50 per cent plus one of the votes in either their caucus or party room for their own power.</para><para>Let us consider what will happen when it comes to the very important issue of the role of head of state under the proposed new constitutionâand that is what it will be; you cannot say it is the existing constitution because it will have 69 changes to it. It will be a new constitution, with very little resemblance to the old one. It will be a new Australian political system. Under that proposal the dismissal provisions provide something unique in the free worldâthat the Prime Minister can sack the President in writing and effectively in secret. The only constraint on a Prime Minister dismissing the President or head of state is a political constraint.</para><para>To home in on that point we need to understand that the new head of state will derive his or her power from that vote I referred to earlierâfrom a vote of two-thirds of the politicians sitting at any one time in the Australian parliament; that is, the two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is how the president derives his or her power. That power is limited by the fact that 
 the person has as their most important roleâforgetting all the other roles that are performed by either the Governor-General now or the President as would occur if the case gets up in Novemberâthat of umpire in any political or constitutional crisis in Australia. The head of state will be an independent umpire who can seek to resolve a political or constitutional crisis, ensure that Australia's government and democratic institutions move on and that the best interests of the people prevail.</para><para>In that case, you have a president who, having to make a crucial decision at a time of crisis within our political or constitutional systems, has hanging over his or her head the threat of dismissal. If we want to use the umpire analogy on a field of play, the umpire who is contemplating raising the whistle to his or her mouth would have the threat hanging over his or her head that he or she would be sacked or dismissed unilaterally before he or she has a chance to blow air through that whistle.</para><para>Therein lies one of the significant problems of the republican model. The only constraint on the Prime Minister from dismissing that President before he or she blows the whistle is the threat to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister get a motion moved by the House of Representatives. This is the nub of the issue that I want to raise here todayâit is not the Australian Parliament, it is the House of Representatives, because the Senate has no say in this dismissal. It is a point that has not been featured in any article that I have been able to find in any major metropolitan newspaper. For probably only the second time in nearly 100 years where a major decision needs to be taken by the Australian Parliament, the Senate is rubbed out unilaterally. The Senate has no say. Senators elected by the millions of Australians who democratically go along and vote every three years have no say in this crucial decision.</para><para>So what the Prime Minister needs to do is contemplate whether he can get a majority in his party room to support that decision. So he needs 50 per cent plus one in his party roomâor her party room when we have a female prime minister, which I am sure will 
 occur at some stage, I hope during my lifetime. I hope it is a Liberal too, Senator Coonan. He or she will need to know that he or she has 50 per cent plus one in their party room because that is how prime ministers have their jobs. As Mr Hawke and Mr Keating and previous prime ministers know, if they do not have 50 per cent plus one in their party room, they are not the prime minister.</para><para>So the only political constraint on a prime minister exercising his power to unilaterallyâand, effectively, secretly in the first instanceâdismiss the president, the umpire, is in fact that constraint. I say to you that that is the only timeâwith one exception and that exception is a very weak one which I will go into laterâwhen the Australian Parliament has been asked to make a decision, but only the House of Representatives actually does it. I say that that is an overturning of the whole foundation of Australia's federation. I put it to the Senateâand it is probably now a gratuitous argument, because we are a great federation and we are a great federation because our founding fathers gave us such a fantastic constitution and such powerful institutions as the Senateâthat had the founding fathers proposed or had proposed to them that our head of state be elected by two-thirds of the politicians, but dismissed by potentially 23 per cent of the parliamentâwhich is all that the Prime Minister requiresâand that the Senate would have no say in that dismissal, then the founding fathers would not have had their constitution and the federation supported by the Australian people. There is no way in the world that the people of Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia or Queensland would have voted as they did nearly 100 years ago to form a federation if the Senate, which was so crucial to bringing the smaller, outlying, less populous states into the federation in the first place, would not have had a say in the dismissal.</para><para>I said earlier that there has been only one other example that I can findâand I am happy for the yes case to find another exampleâwhere that applies in the Australian constitution or our history. That relates to referendums themselves. Section 128 of the 
 Constitution provides that if one house of the parliament passes a bill for an act for a referendum, it is passed twice within a statutory timeâI think it is a three-month period in betweenâand the other house fails to pass it, then the Governor-General can refer those matters to the people at a referendum.</para><para>So, hypothetically, if the House of Representatives were to pass some referendum proposals twice, the Senate rejected them, and the House of Representatives passed them again three months later, the government of the day could put to the Governor-General that those matters be put, as happened in 1974. The result, of course, was that those proposals went down. I think that probably reflects what has happened in Australian constitutional history and the history of referendumsâthat unless there is broad bipartisan support, referendums do not usually get up.</para><para>Section 128 says that one house of parliament can pass a referendum proposal twice, when the other place does not. Why is the Senate being taken out of that process? Although it is quite explicit in section 128 that one house can pass a measure twice and have it put to the people, when that was sought to be practised in 1914 when the Senate twice passed two proposals with the statutory required time in between, the then Governor-General, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, on the advice of his ministers, refused to put the proposal to the people.</para><para>One would suspect that if the Senate made a proposal, just as the House of Representatives did in 1974, and the other place did not support it, it probably would not have got up anyway. But the practice in Australia now is that the House of Representatives can pass measures twice and have them put to the people and historically the Senate cannot. That is the only other case we can find where the Senate is not part of the powers of the Australian Parliament.</para><para>So here we have a fundamental change to Australia's system of government. The reality is that a head of state will have his or her power base formed by a voteânot a selective ballot; no more than one name will be put forward. We will not have any choice in that; 
 the name of the candidate will emerge through a process that I have said is less transparent than that which applies in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and less transparent than that which applies in the People's Republic of China. The secret central committee makes the nominations, is sworn to secrecyâin fact, it is required by this parliament to conduct those discussions in secretâand provides those nominations to the Prime Minister in secret. The Prime Minister can reject that nomination.</para><para>So we have a secretive process where the people will not know who the candidate is until that name appears in a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament and then, as senators, we will have a chance to vote on that. That all sounds niceâwe have a quasi-democratic process there; almost as democratic as that of the People's Republic of China! I suggest to you, Mr Deputy President, that if you suggested to the people of East Timor that they adopt that same process for the election of their first president they would laugh you out of any international forum.</para><para>When it comes to dismissal, at the crucial time when the future head of state needs to make a vital decision about the future of Australia's democracy, resolving conflicts, then the Senate is unilaterally taken out of the decision. All the Prime Minister of the time needs is the support, not of two-thirds of the Parliament, but of 23 per cent of the parliament. On any objective assessment of democratic principles, it cannot be right that the President could be made to go on a decision of 23 per cent of the parliament, when 77 per cent actually support that President.</para><para> Sitting suspended from 1.50 p.m. to 2 p.m. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>9585</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>9585</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI wish to inform the Senate that Senator Vanstone will not be with us today for family reasons.

All you can do is come back and try and resurrect the line that Senator Lundy has been assiduously pursuing to cultivate local support in the ACT region. That has nothing to do with serious government policy. The sooner that Senator Lundy asks for a bit of help on policy, the better off we will all be. You cannot have it both ways. You will find, if you look at what is happening around the world, that governments of all persuasions are going down the path of ensuring that you have efficient operations, that you get best value for taxpayers' dollars and, at the same time, that you make every opportunity available to local suppliers. But we do not, in this day and age, insist on locals getting priority irrespective of merit. I know it is the trade union approach and I know the riding instructions you get, but that is not our approach. We think that the best outcome for taxpayers is actually lower cost burdensâin other words, the capacity to reduce taxes, not increase them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>9586</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>9586</page.no><name role="metadata">The PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOrder!

Our new Job Network program now involves the provision of four times as many sites as the old CES program. The Work for the Dole pilot program shows that 32 per cent of participants who left the scheme have gone on to unsubsidised employment within three months. That is a pretty fantastic outcome. A Morgan and Banks survey found that nearly 60 per cent of employers would be more likely to employ someone who has been on a Work for the Dole project than someone unemployed without this experience.</para></talk.start><para>What is the alternative? The alternative is the failed approach that has been adopted by our predecessorsâthe old Working Nation program. When poor old Mrs Kernot, who has been absolutely exhausted, we know, and does not have time to leave the electorate these days, was asked last month what she had been doing, she said, `I've certainly been working. I have had lots of meetings with the TWU.' That would be a job strategy endorsed by her successor in title, Mr Ferguson, because that is the main game as far as he is concerned. He is particularly impressed by 
 Working Nation because it benefits the trade unionsâ`$1.7 million provided to fund training liaison officers.' We know that is a euphemism for making sure that the lads at the Trades Hall get a bit of an extra handout courtesy of the taxpayers.</para><para>We have a sensible approach to trying to solve the problems of the unemployed. Those who want to revert to Working Nation ought to accept that it did not deliver the goods. Even Mr Ferguson has said, `It is true that, out of a lot of our training programs, people did not get a job at the end of it.' What a devastating self-indictment. Why would you even contemplate going back on this path? The answer is, of course, that they do not have any policy solutions. That is the tragedy of it. The only glimmer of hope is that Mr McMullan is reported today as saying that Labor might need to start taking some hard policy decisions early in the near term rather than later. This is a revolutionary doctrine! He describes this as a break with tradition.</para><para>I do not know who established the tradition; it is basically a failed strategy. The strategy was: `They threw us out in 1996; we'll spend three years doing nothing, keep our heads down, hope no-one notices, and we might slide back in on the unpopularity of the government.' It failed. It did not deliver the goods, but, unfortunately, Mr Beazley has not noticed. Mr Beazley is out there saying, for example, that in March this year he was going to have a vision launch where he promised not simply to put down a set of thoughts but to put those thoughts into material policy. Then he said, `If you like, we will come up with a skeleton of a substantial series of initiatives.' Then, of course, we had a pathways speech on employment that had a rider on the contents page saying, `The options canvassed here have no formal status.' Then he said he would launch a more detailed policy discussion paper in September. Now we know that he cannot ride a horse and chew gum, because that has been put off until after the referendum.</para><para>It is simply not good enough. Having a burnt out Rhodes Scholar with all the intellectual policy vigour of Yogi Bear is not going to get you anywhere in the lead-up to the next 
 election. You will have to face up to the fact that Mr McMullan is dead right. The punters do expect a bit of policy alternative. They do not want you to simply go back to the old handout to the trade union mentality that characterised your approach. They want serious programs and mutual obligations. Look at what is going on with your soul brothers over in the UK and you will see the way ahead. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: MRI Scans</title><page.no>9588</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9588</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

Our support for venture capital in Australia is turning out to be a real success story.

The record number of deals for 1998-99 was driven by a doubling, a 100 per cent increase, in activity in the seed, start-up and early expansion categories.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Victor Bivell, the publisher of this journal, said that the government's Innovation Investment Fund and Pooled Development Fund programs must take credit for the increased levels of activity in early stage investments. While I do give credit to the previous government for the Pooled Development Fund Program that we are continuing, we initiated the Innovation Investment Fund, and it is clear that these programs are providing a real stimulus to venture capital. In fact, one-third of the hundred early stage investments in the June quarter alone were due to these programs. The Venture Capital Association executive director, Andrew Green, said that the volume of money coming into the market needs to grow and that the government's Ralph reforms would facilitate this. Of course, our business tax reforms will help in a number of ways. At the moment we have got only about 12 per cent of our funds coming in from international sources compared to 57 per cent coming into the UK, for 
 example. So our decision to exempt eligible investments by foreign pension funds from capital gains tax really is good news for the Australian venture capital industry and for the growth of the Australian economy.</para><para>The other major boosts for Australian innovation in the Ralph reforms are the halving of the capital gains tax rate and the cut in the corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. These reforms, taken as a packageâit is important to recognise them as a packageâwill give us a much more internationally competitive business tax regime. As I have said before, this has been most significantly recognised by the Institute of Engineers, which said in response to our Ralph reforms that business tax reforms will result in a rush of foreign money into high technology, more local R&amp;D, more jobs for engineers, a halt to the brain drain and a healthier, more certain climate for domestic investment in start-up companies.	I am glad that the opposition agrees with us. I am glad that the opposition recognises the benefits of these reforms. Mr McMullan, my shadow, said in response to the Ralph report release:</para><para>Labor supports the government's proposal to provide a CGT exemption to investments in venture capital projects in Australia by overseas pension funds.</para><para>I am very glad that not all policy development in the Labor Party has been put off until after the referendum.

I do hope that Mr 30 per cent, the Leader of the Opposition, will in fact deal himself back into relevance in Australian public debate and support this package. It is a package that delivers a much better tax system, more investment, more venture capital and ultimately something we should all be concerned about, more jobs.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: MRI Scans</title><page.no>9590</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>9590</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a further question to Senator Herron in his capacity representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

I mentioned previously that there are 92 eligible MRI sites registered with the Health Insurance Commission and of these 84 are accessing Medicare funding. The Health Insurance Commission is proceeding with investigations relating to provider eligibility. I think it would be incorrect to divulge anything in relation to that investigation while it is in progress. The Labor Party may operate that way, but that investigation is proceeding.</para></talk.start><para>Of course the magnetic resonance imaging service providers must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for Medicare benefit payments. These include that providers must be specialists in diagnostic radiology, participating in the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists quality and accreditation program, services must be performed under the professional supervision of an eligible MRI provider, and services must be performed on eligible equipment. The cut-off time for machine eligibility was announced by the government on budget night 1998. Where providers ordered equipment prior to budget night, they are required to provide supporting documentation as part of a statutory declaration. Statutory declarations in relation to equipment on order needed to be provided to the Health Insurance Commission by 11 October this year.</para><para>The Health Insurance Commission has been conducting investigations into contracts purported to be signed before the budget as part of its ongoing monitoring role. As I also mentioned previously, one case has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecu

Compulsory powers of investigation have been approved under part 2D of the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and additional resources have been allocated to these investigations, which have proved to be more complex than anticipated and have increased in number, leading to a later completion date of November this year.</para><para>There have been concerns expressed in relation to the length of time that these investigations are taking, and I take it that that is what Senator Evans is referring to. The minister is confident that the investigations are being properly conducted, and he would emphasise the importance of allowing this process to be completed in a thorough fashion to prevent any need to revisit the investigations in the future. He noted that it has been claimed that 14 new MRI units were purchased by companies associated with members of the executive of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists and its MRI task force.

The government has used the costing methodology prepared by the Review of Business Taxation, more commonly known as the Ralph report. The announced integrity measures and the anti-avoidance measures you refer to relate to the tightening of the thirteenth-month rule for advance expenditure, preventing loss duplication and value shifting, addressing the taxation of lease assignments and reforming excess deduction rules for mining operations. The key differences in the government's and Ralph's costings are in respect of the first two measures listed above. The tightening of the prepayment rules has been brought forward to take effect from the date of announcement rather than from 1 July 2000, and the revenue estimates for loss 
 duplication and value shifting measures differ because of the government's decision to delay the implementation of the entity regime to reduce the compliance burden on industry.

Contrary to some reports in the mediaâdespite my press release which set it out very clearlyâmy department is funding the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children. The Department of Family and Community Services is the line department that should be funding an organisation like that. Since 1996 the government has been talking about and had a policy on trying to see that NGOs who are relevant to particular line departments are funded wherever possible by that department because they build up a community of interest. It is beneficial to the NGO and it is also beneficial to the public servants who are working in that area to have regular feedback and contact with NGOs in that area. It is very logical.

The shame is that Labor never looked at the funding needs of women's NGOs. Labor gave them block grants occasionally. They were always for 12 months.

The women's roundtable was established for a two-day session by me so that women's organisations could get a better chance of having an ex 
 change of views with government and be more valuable to them. That was at their request because the programs we inherited from Carmen Lawrence did not give women's organisations an opportunity to have their own agendas raised with the government. So that is the first thing. The second thing is that the women's organisations have come to the government again and said that they would like more time to raise issues because the number of organisations that would be there meant that there was very constrained time for discussion. We looked to see what we could do to make sure that it was a more meaningful and valuable experience for women's NGOs; therefore, we have reduced the number of women from about 50 to about 40. I think the ALP is running up a blind alley on that, too. In addition, I have a group of colleagues who work with me in each state and territory to consult with women in roundtable discussions.

He would not understand the importance of transport and transport costs to people who live in regional and rural Australia. Mr Ferguson cannot be expected to understand that.

What has happened is that $300,000 has been given out in the first round to three organisations and, as Senator Newman said in answer to a question, on a triennium basis for the first time women's organisations have been funded for three years in order for them to make plans and organise themselves ahead, and there is $200,000 still to be allocated to organisations in the second round.</para></talk.start><para>I have to admit a vested interest as a member of the Girl Guides Association of Australia. Only last Saturday, I completed a term on the council of the Victorian Girl Guides Association. Whenever I have been approached by anybody in guiding as to whether they should have government funding I have said, `No, I don't think we should ever apply for government funding.' One of the reasons I have always said that is that from my time in guiding, from the age of 10, we were always trained and brought up to work for what we had. That is why guiding and scouting has `Cents for service', what was called in the olden days `Willing shilling', in order to be able to fund ourselves. So my preference is not for our association to have funding. There are others in my organisation who may disagree with that.</para><para>In general, we have managed, and we managed under Labor with no funding whatsoever out of OSW for general grant funding which the Guides got last year. Having expressed my personal preference, I want to say that it is misleading for Labor to say that we are going to defund organisations, when $200,000 remain. It is also misleading to say that Senator Newman magically found some $50,000 for the National Council for Single Mothers, when in fact she has diligently asked every minister to look at ways and means in which their portfolios can fund women's organisations out of mainstream budget lines.</para><para>We have seen that happen out of the Office of Disabilityâ$50,000 for sport for women with disabilities. We have seen funding for rural women through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As Senator Newman said, organisations then have direct contact with the principal departments, so they are meeting with officers and bureaucrats who are working on policy and developing the government's responses, and have first-hand access, so that rural women feed into the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and women with disabilities have direct contact with the Office of Disability. So Senator Newman actually practised what she was preaching by funding the National Council for Single Mothers out of the Department of Family and Community Services. That is the approach she has been taking.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">CROSSIN</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>âShe finally gave money to the custodial parents rather than to the non-custodial parents.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âYou will have your time soon, Senator Crossin.

I wish to concentrate on answers by Senator Newman and Senator Alston concerning pregnancy testing in the workplace and defunding of various women's groups and organisations around Australia. Those questions and answers go to the bona fides of the government in this area of women's interests, women's advancement and the need for professionalism, as stated by the minister. The respective answers highlight the ineptitude of the government. When the current government came to power, it made much ado about a new approach, a new focus, about being more inclusive, more consultative. All of those individuals on the outer, or previously excluded, were to be consulted and made part of the new team. The issues covered in the question by Senator Harradine and other senators to Senator Newman put the lie to that proposition.</para></talk.start><para>The issues covered by the questions go to the heart and soul of equal opportunity in Australia. In 20 years in public life I can recall being involved in many campaigns on behalf of female workers and women generally. There were campaigns for equal pay in the seventies, maternity leave by award coverage, superannuation and financial security for low paid private sector workers, sexual harassment-free workplaces and, finally, the right to choose to return to work after the birth of a 
 child and the right to child care and equity based assistance from government. There was nothing remarkableâjust incremental change, gradual improvement, affecting half of the population, giving them the right and the ability to choose to work for reward. Critical to the decision has been consideration of policy matters relating to child care, maternity leave and employment access.</para><para>For almost the last 15 or 20 years it has been settled law in Australia that discrimination against individuals on a range of grounds is illegal. Nearly every award contains a provision to outlaw discrimination on grounds of age, gender, sexuality, ethnic origin and religious belief. Yet the government, Minister Alston and Minister Newman, on behalf of the Office of the Status of Women, say nothing. They offer no defence and make no explanation as to why the Australian government try to hurt pregnant women in international forums.</para><para>Nearly all women in Australia at some time in their life want to have a family. Most women and families need income support in the years of childbirth and child-rearing. Many women and families need, or want, the mother to return to paid employment. Yet here we have Minister Alston apparently acquiescing in the decision of Minister Reith in international forums saying that the position of the Australian government is that female workers should undergo pregnancy testing as a pre-employment condition. Minister Alston apparently believes that half the population of Australia, in their child-bearing years, should be pregnancy tested to obtain the right to work.</para><para>If the government have made a simple mistake, the sensible thing to do would be to fess up, to outline the facts and to move on to issues of concern. But they have not done that. They have tried to cover up their delegation to the ILO conference and their voting behaviour and pattern. We hear no explanation; we hear no apology. The conclusion is blindingly obvious. The governmentâthese ministersâcannot bring themselves to tell the entire story, to tell the truth. They pay lip-service to ideas and principles of equal opportunity for female workers. The real 
 position, as disclosed on the other side of the world, is to line up with nine or 10 minor countries out of a total of 180 and give the quiet nod to discrimination practices that have been illegal in Australia for 15 or 20 years. This is a shameful and backward position. Now is the time for the respective ministers to unequivocally clear the record and put the position straight.</para><para>Minister Alston, Minister Newman and Minister Reith, in the other place, should state the position of the Australian government as one of support for pregnant workers, opposed to any form of discrimination against female workers, and particularly opposed to pre-employment pregnancy checks for female workers. We have not had that clear statement from Minister Alston today. He tried to get around it by saying that the Australian delegation changed its positionâhad a number of positions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>9602</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat a diatribe!

We have maintained a minimum of $500,000 annually most years, including this one. In fact, this year the level of funding has been higher than that. Prior to the announcement of the funding for the major organisations, $125,000 had already been provided from OSW for operational activities by women's organisations for the first quarter of this financial year, and very soon a further round of project grants of up $25,000 each for women's organisations to undertake projects to advance the status of women and to strengthen their organisations will be made. This will bring the total funding for women's organisations' activities this year to well over $500,000.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Our strategy to assist organisations which provide services to women includes not only 
 the OSW funding but also a recognition that many of the issues of concern to women cut across portfolios held by other ministers.

Following Senator Ferris's comments, the facts of the matter still have not come out. Like Senator Harradine, I was fairly dissatisfied with the response from Senator Alston and I was going to be asking Senator Newman pretty much the same question. Given Senator Newman's response to other questions in question time today, I doubt that I would have had a satisfactory answer from her. Even though we have taken note of this issue today, neither Senator Patterson nor Senator Ferris has dealt with this issue. Perhaps it is embarrassment. Perhaps the next government speaker might throw some more light onto it. I see Senator Ferris leaving the chamber. The facts of the 
 matter are these. How on earth did that survey question ever get filed on behalf of the Australian government? As Senator Alston has already admitted, the government then retreated from that situation, but how on earth did it every happen in the first place? Senator Alston is right. The answer we gave to that survey is inconsistent with Australian law. But that still does not answer the question: how on earth did it ever happen in the first place?</para></talk.start><para>Let me go to the precise question. I do not need a lesson from Senator Alston on ILO practice, procedure or correct government documentation to the ILO. I have the relevant documentation here. The question that was asked and completed by the Australian government was:</para><para>When a woman is applying for employment, should employers be prohibited from requiring a test for pregnancy or a certificate of such a test, . . . </para><para>Should an employer be prohibited? The answer quite clearly was noâfull stop. Then we go on to a commentânot a caveat. This is not a caveat on the answer of no. This is simply a comment. The comment can basically be described as, `We can justify allowing this to happen on the basis that it is not the act itself but only if discrimination occurs that is the problem.' But as Senator Harradine already pointed out in question time today, if a woman wants a job she is going to comply. If a woman wants the job and this is a condition established by the employer, then the woman is going to comply.</para><para>Let me highlight another inadequacy with the government's response. The government talks about the problem of medical tests. If a general medical test is required for employment, then pregnancy may impact on that test. As I said to a journalist during this debate, the answer to that situation is quite simple. It is very simple. If you need to know if a woman is pregnant to justify some other test, then it can be a confidential matter between the doctor and the woman. It does not have to be a test that the employer is aware of. Any adequate practitioner can keep such information confidential to themselves. It does not have to go to the employer.</para><para>Again, the Australian government was sorely embarrassed in this situation. It was embarrassed to join only these countries: Argentina, Bahrain, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe. I hope women on the other side are embarrassed by this performance. Our representatives at the ILO did eventually back away from this position, thank God. But how on earth did we get into this embarrassing position in the first place? Was there no woman present on the delegation? Maybe that is one highlight of why it might have occurred. Certainly, I know it would not have occurred from representation by our government in the past. I know many adequate women officers within the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business who would never have allowed this situation to arise in relation to a survey.</para><para>The only government response that I have seen so far is from Tony Abbott, Minister for Employment Services, saying the contrary to today's media reports. The media reports were accurate. We have not had from the government to date an accurate response as to how on earth it put itself in this position in an international forum and embarrassed all Australian womenâbecause that is what it did. Its treatment of the funding of women's organisations is just further embarrassment. It is not professionalising the women's movement, as Pru Goward said last night. It is actually highlighting what it is really about: representing only the right woman. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>9604</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Vic</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, may I do what Senator Bishop did and declare my interest in these women's issues.

I am in debt to you for your direction. In that case, can I first refer to Senator Newman's answers. It occurs to me that, obviously, senators on the other side did not listen to the answers given by the minister. Much has been made of certain organisations being supposedly defunded, but there are two things that the minister said which are fundamental to the whole issue. Firstly, she said that it is this government's policy that funding should be carried out by line departments. In other words, departments like the Office of the Status of Women should assist women's groups to start activities and encourage them to carry out activities which will improve the position of women in society, as an initial step, and, once the groups have established their direction of interest, funding should be gained from departments, and other sources, which are more directly involved in those areas. For example, as the minister said, last year $350,000 additional funding was obtained by women's organisations from other sources. In fact, it is one of the areas in which the Office of the Status of Women actually assists organisations to obtain funding.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second thing that the minister said which seemed to escape the attention of the 
 senators on the other side is that there is a second round of funding to come, consisting of something like $250,000, which is half of the funding that the Office of the Status of Women usually allocates. So it is totally premature for the senators on the other side to get upset about a report on organisations which are supposedly missing out. I will make two points about Senator Bishop's and Senator Collins's comments. Their tirades seem to make two fundamentally flawed assumptions. The question which is being asked should be regarded on a medical ground because every employer has the responsibility to know the wellbeing of their employees. If you assume that automatically all employers are antiwomen, yes, you have a concern. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

It stands as one of the most foolhardy examples of the Government's zealous pursuit of their industrial relations agenda. There is some stiff competition, however. Senators may recall that in the same fell swoop the Government took away the Commission's power to make Awards on such 
 extreme things as: occupational health and safety matters; meal break facilities; amenities for people in lunch rooms; the fact that there should be first aid kits provided in workplaces; or sexual harassment matters.</para><para>It is an indication of this government's obsession about industrial relations that it has been willing to sacrifice good defence policy on the altar of its flat earth industrial relations obsessions. It has been a pursuit of its divisive and ideologically driven industrial relations agenda at whatever cost. And the agenda continues, with the Government's 2nd wave of industrial intervention, currently before a Senate committee inquiry.</para><para>If there is one thing worse than bad policy, which this clearly is, it is refusing to accept that a mistake has been made, and refusing to rectify that mistake. And this Government can be under no illusions that they made a boo-boo. Since the 1996 amendments, they have received and continually ignored advice that a mistake was made, and it needs to be rectified.</para><para>The Defence Reserve Support Committee is an important structure within the defence establishment that assists in resolving difficulties between Reservists and their private employers. It is chaired by Sir James Killen, who is well known to many here. The minutes of its meeting in November last year reveal this:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Sir James informed the Conference he had written to the previous government querying the omission of Reserve leave from the 20 allowable items in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, and discussed the response to his query. He stated that he was unhappy with the response and he intends to pursue the matter.</inline></para><para>You have to rememberâSir James Killen was a Liberal Government Minister for defence and this Government won't even listen to his advice.</para><para>When this Bill was recently presented in the other place, by the Hon Kim Beazley, Mr Beazley made the point that this issue should have been put to rest some years ago, when the Minister for Aged Care, the Hon Bronwyn Bishop was the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. She ignored the advice of Major General Luttrell, the then Assistant Chief of Defence Force Reserves who said to Minister Bishop:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">As Reserve members constitute approximately 40 per cent of the ADF work force, their continued availability for training, as currently provided for in awards, agreements and company personnel policies, is essential to the Australian Defence Force capability.</inline></para><para>Luttrel went on:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">If not identified as a matter for inclusion in awards, Reserve training leave may not be picked 
 up within either the Certified Agreement, Australian Workplace Agreements or other State Agreements which will increasingly supplant existing awards.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Although not one of the safety net employment conditions identified in the Bill, Reserve availability for training is critical to maintaining defence capability and ward coverage of this issue is an important component of ensuring availability. The Bill should therefore include provisions which would permit awards to continue to cover Defence Force leave provisions.</inline></para><para>In February of 1998 Minister Bishop wrote to the Armed Force Federation saying:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">I am well aware of the threat to reserve training as a possible outcome of the Workplace Relations Act.</inline></para><para>She should have been, because the matter had been raised with her in the Parliament and with her senior minister a year earlier. So what has the Government done about that in the two years since this matter was first raised and the nearly three years now since its legislation created this problem? The simple fact is it has done nothing.</para><para>Labor have recognised that there is a problem, and have been willing to do something about it.</para><para>We have raised questions on notice and questions without notice, and received empty promises or no answer at all. My colleagues have introduced Private Members Bills in the other place. The Hon. Arch Bevis MP, Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, introduced the Workplace Relations Amendment (Defence Purposes Leave) Bill 1999 on 21 June this yearâbut the Government didn't bring it on for debate.</para><para>As I mentioned, the Hon. Kim Beazley MP introduced this bill into the House of Representatives, as I am now doing here today. I hope, in the current climate, the Government will now allow debate on this issue and allow this bill to proceed. This bill will provide job security for those men and women who wish to undertake duty as an Australian Defence Force Reservist, and allow them to undertake the training they need to prepare them for the dangerous circumstances they may find themselves in.

That 
 business was no less that the prohibition and punishment of the heinous crime of genocide.</para><para>In 1949, no doubt after some of the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust had become known, Australia ratified the <inline font-style="italic">Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</inline> . It was a good and necessary thing to do, however fifty years down the trackâthe prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide remains unfinished business by the Commonwealth Parliament.</para><para>At the time of the introduction of the Bill, then member for Macquarie and <inline font-weight="bold">Labor</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Prime Minister Ben Chifley </inline> had the following to say:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The purpose of this Bill is to seek the approval of the Parliament for Australian ratification of the International Convention on the prevention and punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Genocide, which means the wholesale or partial destruction of religious, racial or national groups has long shocked the conscience of mankind.</inline></para><para>During the debate on the same Bill, the Leader of the Opposition and founder of the Liberal Party of AustraliaâMr Menzies had this to say:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Every member of this Parliament must view with equal horror the practice of mass killing and of persecution of people to the death, for the reasons of race or religion or for other reasons of the kind referred to in the convention. Of course the crime of genocide was not peculiar to Germany; I am not without my suspicions, nor are honourable members, that it is still going on in some parts of the civilized world, and for all I know may be going on in countries, one or more which are signatories to this convention.</inline></para><para>Mr Menzies went on to say:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Persecution of the kind against which the convention is directed must never be tolerated . . . and I am perfectly certain that it will never be tolerated here.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">However the last thing I should dream of doing would be to speak or vote in such a way as to cast any doubt on the proposition that in Australia we abominate the crime of genocide. No body has ever doubted it. If it needs our subscription to a convention to advertise our feelings to the world, then let us subscribe to it.</inline></para><para>Honourable Senators, it falls upon each generation to assert the basic minimum standards of humanity and upon every politician to uphold those standards. It is therefore out of a solemn sense of duty that I, as a representative of my generation, present this Bill for consideration by the Australian Senate.</para><para>Fifty years is a long time to have unfinished business and I would be pleased to be able stand here today and echo the words of Sir Robert Menzies and say that: 
</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Persecution of the kind against which the convention is directed must never be tolerated . . . and I am perfectly certain that it will never be tolerated here.</inline></para><para>However as recently as September this year, the Federal Court of Australia in the case of <inline font-style="italic"> Nulyarimma v Thompson</inline>   (1/9/99 Federal Court) confirmed that there was indeed no offence of genocide known in Australian law. While the details of this case are certain to be debated for many years to comeâthe one resounding message is clearâat this present time, genocide is not unlawful in Australia.</para><para>As this Bill is tabled in the Senate, news is emerging from our closest neighbours in East Timor of atrocities, war crimes and evidence of genocide. Indeed, before the United Nations last month, the Foreign Minister Mr Downer said:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">In the face of acts of genocide or of human rights abuses on a horrendous scale (in East Timor) the nations of the world must act.</inline></para><para>The Australian Democrats continue to endorse this Government's peace-keeping role in East Timor. However, as a nation we must, I believe, be active as well as reactive in the face of genocide. We must lead by example. This Bill provides that example.</para><para>Some people have suggested that it is unnecessary to legislate against the crime of genocide in Australia. They argue that the existing criminal laws at State and Territory level are sufficient protection against arbitrary and systemic persecution and murder. The Australian Democrats disagree. In those terms the convention clearly distinguishes the offence of genocide as a crime that is directed at a particular group. It is the <inline font-style="italic">membership </inline> of a group which distinguishes this crime.</para><para>It was the fact of being targeted on the grounds of religion, ethnicity, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender or disability which previously has qualified people as targets for genocide and for no other reason.</para><para>I would like to turn now to what is <inline font-style="italic">meant </inline> by genocide</para><para>This convention defines genocide as follows:</para><para>Article II, stipulates that any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, and includes the:</para><para>(a)	 killing members of a group</para><para>(b)	 causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group</para><para>(c)	 deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about it's physical destruction in whole or in part 
</para><para>(d)	 imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</para><para>(e)	 forcibly transferring children of the group to another group</para><para>Article III clarifies that not only is genocide a crime, so to is "conspiracy to commit genocide", "direct and public incitement to commit genocide", "attempt to commit genocide" and "complicity in genocide".</para><para>Honourable SenatorsâGenocide is as much a political crime as it is a crime against humanity. It is a crime which rests in the abuse of power by those who have power, against those who do not. As a political crime, it is as appropriate that in this Senate, in this Parliament and in this country that we as this generation of political leaders, stand side by side with the sentiments of Ben Chifley and Robert Menzies expressed fifty years ago.</para><para>The Bill to ratify Convention passed through this Parliament with multipartisan support in 1949. Indeed chief amongst its supporters was the father of the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley.   At the time, Mr Kim Beazley senior said:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Every person in Australia with red blood in his veins and a spirit of humanity in his heart should applaud the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) for supporting a Bill of this kind so soon after his return to Australia and for seeking the approval of the Australian Parliament to such a magnificent statement of this country's intentions to do all in its power to prevent the commission of the acts that are referred to in this convention.</inline></para><para>I signal here my intention to approach the Leader of the Opposition to seek his and his party's support to complete the work that his father helped start in 1949. I will also be writing to my Senate colleagues, the Prime Minister and members of the House of Representatives to seek their support. I look forward to their co-operation on this issue.</para><para>It is my intention that this Bill now be referred to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report to the Senate mid next year. Accordingly, I will be giving a notice of motion today. The reference of this Bill to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional References Committee will give members of the community the opportunity to comment upon the Bill and make suggestions for its improvement. I welcome this process and input, sincerely believing that the wider input of the Australian community is necessary to raise awareness of the issues surrounding genocide and to make this Bill Australia's best statement against this crime.</para><para>Comparative jurisdictions have implemented their obligations under the convention. The UK has implemented under its <inline font-style="italic">Genocide Act 1969</inline> , and section 318 of the <inline font-style="italic">Canadian Criminal Code </inline> has 
 implemented the convention to a more limited extent. The United States of America implemented legislation in 1988. Since then, there have been numerous calls for Australia to follow suit, most notably in the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law 1991, which stated:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">". . . .the Australian Government decided in 1949 to limit Australian legislation to approve ratification.  Whether there should be further Australian implementation or clarifying legislation was left in abeyance until the attitude of other contracting parties and action taken by other contracting parties as regards their domestic legislation was known.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">	 The position of Australian law as regards to this convention, in the opinion of the review committee is clearly unsatisfactory."</inline></para><para>In closing I wish to dedicate this Bill and the ensuing Senate Committee inquiry that will follow to all those who have suffered the horrors of genocide. To the Jewish community, the Armenians, the Rawandans, Tibetans, Cambodians, Kosovars, East Timorese, non-Han ethnic Chinese, peoples of the former Yugoslavia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, to people with disabilities, the gay and lesbian community and the many others who have suffered genocide, this Bill is introduced into the Senate in their memory and through the determination I have to see Australia lead by example in this regard.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>9614</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>9614</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>9614</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I appreciate the courtesy you have shown me in this matter.

I understand that senators in the chamber are happy to give leave on this occasion, and I certainly never stand in the way of the chamber moving along to deal with these sorts of matters as quickly and expeditiously as possible. But 
 I do make the point that, with the changes to our sessional orders or orders of continuing effectâI am not quite clear, but I think it is standing order 76âthere is a capacity for us not to have to do this. That is one of the intentions. However, in this case I understand that it is an important issue, and I think it would be generous of the Senate to give leave to Senator Murray and to Senator Cook, who wants to do the same thing. I have no objection. I just draw that to your attention, Madam Deputy President, because the Procedure Committee looked at some changes to try to ensure that we did not need to have this procedure.

This is an interim report which looks at the background to the very significant inquiry into section 206(d) of the Native Title Act. This report covers the proceedings of a conference which was held on 15 March this year to give background to the inquiry.</para><para>The inquiry covers a range of issues including, very importantly, the effectiveness of the National Native Title Tribunal, the operation of the Torres Strait Islander Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation, the extent of the extinguishment or impairment of native title rights and interests as a result of the operation of the act and the effect of the operation of the act on land management.</para><para>The committee is consulting widely across the Australian community about the act, and the proceedings that are tabled today signify the start of this inquiry. The conference was most successful. It was well attended, with a range of participants from the Kimberley Land Council, the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, a number of government departments, ATSIC, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Native Title Tribunal and of course the Indigenous Land Corporation.</para><para>The contribution of all those participants was of great assistance in identifying issues of concern to the inquiry. We have already conducted a number of public hearings in this regard. In Western Australia we have been to Broome, Kununurra, Kalgoorlie and Perth. We have been up in the regional areas of Queensland, including Mount Isa. In coming months the committee will also be conducting public hearings in South Australia and in the Torres Strait as part of this inquiry.</para><para>This report contains information which is of great importance. In addition to being informative on past developments, the 15th report also foreshadows some of the major issues that will be the focus of the committee's 
 consideration in the course of the section 206(d) inquiry. For example, chapters 2 and 8 summarise the history and function of two important institutional bodies: the Native Title Tribunal and the Indigenous Land Corporation. In chapter 2, which looks at the effectiveness of the Native Title Tribunal, the report notes that the assessment of the tribunal's effectiveness must focus on the core function of the tribunal, which is now mediation.</para><para>In chapter 7 the report provides an overview of the issues for land management which were brought about by the recognition of native title at common law within Australia. Included in this chapter is a useful summary of the future act regime of the Native Title Act, both in its original form and also after amendment, and of the provisions which deal with the indigenous land use agreements which were added in the amendments of 1998 and are now proving to be very successful in resolving issues involving native title.</para><para>The committee is carefully considering the effectiveness of the indigenous land use provisions of the act in resolving issues related to future acts. This section 206(d) inquiry is the most important and wide ranging to be conducted by the committee. It is essentially an inquiry into the effectiveness and consequences of the major features of the Native Title Act and the impact of the act on land ownership and the management of it from both an indigenous and non-indigenous perspective.</para><para>The information contained in the 15th report is an important starting point for the committee's current inquiry. It will also be useful and informative for any person who is interested in this area of law and in the committee's current inquiry. I commend the 15th report to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>9617</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThe President has received letters from party leaders seeking variations to the membership of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Economics References Committeeâ</para><para>Participating member: Senator Schacht for the committee's inquiry into the provisions of the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 and the practice of multi-site franchising by oil companies</para><para>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committeeâ</para><para>Substitute member: Senator Parer to replace Senator Crane for the committee's inquiry into the development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Master Plan for the future construction of a western parallel runway.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>9618</page.no><id.no>r717</id.no></debateinfo><para>A message received from the House of Representatives acquainting the Senate that it had agreed to the amendments requested by the Senate to the bill and that it had also made further amendments to the bill in which it desired the concurrence of the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of the message in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>9618</page.no><id.no>r911</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>9618</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>9618</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>9618</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.

We said yesterday that we were committed to facilitating the <inline ref="r815">ACIS Administration Bill 1999</inline>  and today we will deliver on that commitment. We are doing this because Senator Minchin has managed to get himself caught on a hook from which he cannot get off. We 
 will get Senator Minchin off the hook. He should have but we will.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Minchin is on this hook because of his own failure to act on this bill. He has known for five months that he had a problemâthat we were proposing a review of ACIS before it was to cease. We moved these amendments five months ago in the House of Representatives, but Senator Minchin did nothing. He had no discussions with us until the very last minute. I do not think he had any discussions with the Democrats at all. He should not pretend, as he has been doing, that we had come up with some last minute opposition to this bill. He knows that is not true. He had five months to consider, discuss and negotiate about the timing of the proposed review. He knows that we have not opposed any other aspect of the package. Why should we? It was through our efforts from opposition that the government even agreed to it in the first place.</para><para>Unfortunately, Senator Minchin has spent the last five months trying to save the Queen. He should have been spending it trying to save the car industry. Senator Minchin reacted only when the ACIS bill got to the Senateâfar too late. So it was Senator Minchin, not us, who put doubt on the future of the ACIS package by not dealing with sensible amendments and sitting on his hands for five months. What was our amendment? We debated it yesterday. We want to have a review of ACIS before it endsâhardly revolutionary stuff. In fact, by any objective measure, this is eminently sensible. Instead, we will now be left with the absurd position where there will be a review of a scheme after the scheme has already endedâtalk about putting the cart before the horse! It is a bit like debating Charles's suitability as the future King of Australia after we have become a republic. I can see how Senator Minchin would be emotionally, if not intellectually, committed to that debate. I cannot see why he should apply such nonsense to such an important industry as the car industry. It is this absurd outcome which shows that Senator Minchin has been prepared to jeopardise and play politics with this important scheme. I want to make it perfectly clear that Labor 
 would still like ACIS to be reviewed before its completion date of 2005.

 Democrats on this issue. Yesterday, in an answer to a dorothy dixer from his own backbench, Mr Costello said:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">. . . 32 per cent of Australians directly own shares. In the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, 560,000 Australians purchased shares . . . something like 75 per cent of Telstra employees took up shares.</inline></para><para>He went on to say that 31 per cent of Australians now own shares. This is the sort of revolution that began under the Labor government and has continued under the coalition government. These are the sorts of mum and dad shareholders that the Labor Party is trying to protect today.</para><para>As I have already mentioned, we have a proposition before us that waters down protections for shareholders. Shareholders, not directors, are actually the owners of companies. Directors are the employees of the shareholders. Business Judgment Rule 2C says that directors have to inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent that they reasonably believe to be appropriate. The key there is `inform themselves.' `Inform themselves' is not the same as what has been through the court system. Judges have ruled on these matters, and these are their words: `They should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear on the various matters that come to the board for decision.' That is Rogers in AWA Limited v. Daniels. So the courts have said independent judgment is critical to competent and responsible management. And this bill, as it stands before us today, clearly states:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">A director or other officer of a corporation who makes a business judgment is taken to meet the requirements of subsection (1), and their equivalent duties at common law and in equity, in respect of the judgment if they:</inline></para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(c)	 inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent they reasonably believe to be appropriate;</inline></para><para>This is not the same as the government's touted press releases on this issue and the statements from the parliamentary secretary. The whole thrust, they told us, was `We want to codify what is in the law now'. What is in the law now, protecting hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians and their 
 shareholdings, are judgments like the AWA v. Daniels case in 1992 which say that a director should bring an informed and independent judgment to bear. That is not what is written in this legislation. It is not possible to argue that the words `inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment to the extent they reasonably believe to be appropriate' is the same as `bring an informed and independent judgment to bear'. These are clearly different legal concepts.</para><para>This parliament would be letting down the hundreds of thousands of Australians that the Treasurer touted as recently as yesterday, and it would be watering down the protections that they have and their ability to seek accountability from the people they employ to manage their funds. I implore the Democrats to reconsider their position on this, because it is clear that the words in this bill are not the same as the codifications and the principles that the courts of this country have been establishing for the last 30 years.</para><para>As I said, this is really just a last plea to the Democrats to reconsider. They will not be proud in the future when ordinary Australians lose their life savings, their shares and their shareholder value. I urge the Democrats: reconsider on this issue. It is very important to the future of hundreds of thousands of ordinary, battling Australiansâmums and dadsâthat they are able to call to account their employees and their directors if they see the need to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>9621</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhile Senator Conroy was talking I was reminded of the managed investments bill debate, when I and the Democrats thought that dire things would happen if a particular amendment of ours was not acceptedâwhich have not happened yet, thankfullyâand Labor disagreed with us.

But I say to Senator Murray that a number of the things, a lot of the issues, he raised and that I also raised in that debate are coming to pass. People are worse off because that bill was passed. I know that Senator Murray will be looking forward to the review where we will be able to test a number of the assertions that were put to the committee in the MIA, or the MIB as it now is. When that review comes up, it will show that the people involved in these investments are actually worse off because we passed that bill. Many of them have had amendments to their structures that have actually been slipped through on this bill and that are to their detriment.</para></talk.start><para>There were promised fee savingsâand I am sure Senator Murray knows this. But, not only are fees not going down; a broad range of managed investment fees are going up. And I see you nodding, Senator Murray. Both you and I have been talking to the same people. It has been public. It has been in newspapers that not only have there been excessive increases when there should have been decreases but also the structures of managed investments have been changed, and parts of constitutions or the equivalents of constitutions have been changed in some quite outrageous ways. I think that the issues Senator Murray raised, and I raised to a lesser degree in my contributions in that debate, are coming to pass. So I would urge, Senator Murray, that you and I were probably right last time, and I think that in a couple of years you will have to concede that we were right this time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe question is that opposition amendment No. 1 on sheet 1414 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">	 Question put.</inline></para></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.

The opposition's amendments in this regard are minor but ultimately important. The opposition's first amendment in this area ensures that good faith under civil obligation reflects the full responsibilities of directors as laid down by the courts and corrects the subjective test of the provision which requires directors to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in what they believe to be in the company's interests.</para><para>In addition, as the courts have acknowledged that good faith must be accompanied by appropriate informed judgments, we wish this view to be reflected in the legislation. The government has maintained that its efforts  on defining directors' duties are purely to codify common law, so why not stick to the definition as clearly set out by the courts? 
 Good faith not based on informed judgment injects new doubt as to the meaning of the term. Good faith not based on informed judgment will be taken by directors to be a new lower benchmark in their responsibilities. Moreover, it will send a message to the courts that this is the preferred definition. Like the business judgment rule, the good faith civil obligation provision does not encourage directors to be actively involved in guiding and monitoring the management of a company.</para><para>The government is setting a lower standard for directors in the governance of companies. This is totally inappropriate because it would encourage directors to be less prudent in their decision making. If the government is sincere about clearly reflecting common law in statute, then it should support our amendment in this regard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>9623</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Conroy's presentation was shorter than I expected. Given the rather lengthy and quite strong discussion he and I had, I must say that Senator Conroy knows well how to argue his corner both privately and publicly. Once again these amendments have been delivered with the right intention in mind, but we have some reservations. These two amendments relate to the obligation of good faith which is cast on directors and specifically the obligation which, if reached, will give rise to civil rather than criminal liability. The effect of the amendments is to add a requirement into the good faith obligation that directors must exercise their powers with due regard toâand this is the important areaâand active consideration of all relevant issues and information.</para></talk.start><para>At first glance that sounds very reasonable; however, we have problems for two reasons. Firstly, the obligation of good faith is about acting in the best interests of a corporation and acting for a proper purpose. The obligation of good faith is not about diligence or consideration of all issues. In other words, it is about an attitude not about performance. It is my view that the substance of the amendment which the Labor Party has moved would be better dealt with as an amendment to obligation to act with care and diligence 
 rather than duty of good faith, because active consideration of issues is a matter of diligence rather than good faith.</para><para>Secondly, we would be concerned that the active consideration of all relevant issues requirement would open up a Pandora's box in terms of interpretation. If you imagine a judge who is a stickler for black letter law, he or she might interpret this very widely indeed. He would ask himself or she would ask herself: what precisely does `active consideration of all relevant issues' mean? Does `active consideration of all issues' mean that a full due diligence exercise needs to be conducted of the type that is conducted prior to the issue of prospectuses, with all the consequent costs attached to that? To what length does a director have to go to inform himself or herself of all the relevant issues? There is no reference to information which is reasonably within reach and to reasonable judgment in these matters.</para><para>The interpretation of the expression `the active consideration of all relevant issues' opens the door to a very wide interpretation as to what an average director would have to do to satisfy that obligation. As I have remarked, we believe that the duty of care and diligence combined with the business judgment rule impose an appropriate duty on directors. In fact, part of the business judgment rule requires directors to inform themselves about the subject matter of the judgment. Any reasonable judiciary would regard that as a proper informing processâin other words, one having due regard to the appropriate information. Because of that and because these particular sections have been widely discussed and reviewed, we think that on balance, despite the good intention of the shadow minister, we cannot support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>9623</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just want to respond again to Senator Murray. I appreciate that he believes we are acting with the right motives. I am again, however, disappointed that he fears the words  `informed judgment'. As I indicated in my last contribution, independent judgment is at the heart of a string of court cases in which judges have said that it is not good enough to 
 just say, `I acted in good faith,' and to not make an informed judgment or seek to get information. There is a legal understanding of informed judgmentâthere is an agreed set of principles about informed judgment which courts have ruled on for 30 years.</para></talk.start><para>I am not looking to second-guess what the courts have done previously and the courts have not sought to second-guess business decisions. To argue that informed judgment is something that directors, average or otherwise, should be afraid of is a cop-out. Directors are not the owners. Directors are there to provide the management skillsâthat is why they are employed. When they do not have those skills and they choose not to make an informed judgment, it is not good enough to say that that is constraining them, that they should be able to avoid scrutiny and that they can avoid liability. Again, I would urge the Democrats to reconsider their position on this. Good faith that is not based on informed judgment is an entirely new, lower benchmark for the courts to be told to apply. I do not understand why the government believes that it wants uninformed judgments to be able to pass through under the guise of good faith. I would be interested in a small contribution from Senator Ian Campbell on this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>9624</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am happy to contribute; it is a very important matter. The government's views have been grossly misrepresented. Good faith under common law does ensure that directors have to inform themselves, but what the Labor amendments seek to do is significantly increase the requirement under the current law. All we are doing, I think it is fair to say, is maintaining the existing requirements to act in good faith in a law that stayed in place for the 13 years of the Labor government through a whole range of corporate law reviews undertaken by a series of committees, including one chaired by Senator Barney Cooney and another chaired by Mr Michael Lavarch, former chair of the House of Representatives committee. </para></talk.start><para>I remind the Senate that the committee excellently chaired by Senator Cooney and the committee that reported in November 1991 and that was excellently chaired by Michael Lavarch, who supported Senator Cooney's recommendations in relation to the business judgment rule and directors' duties, without reservation supported the business judgment ruleâwhich the Labor Party today have just voted againstâand did not seek in any way to change the definition of good faith in the Corporations Law.</para><para>As Senator Murray has very accurately said, this would significantly increase the requirements on directors in terms of consideration of all relevant issues and informationâit would be a significant increase in what directors would have to do. As Senator Murray quite properly said, it would mean that a prudent director, in order to protect his or her own legal position, would have to undertake due diligence in relation to every matter of relevance to the company. It is an inane proposal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>9624</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have conferred with other senators in the chamber.

I thank Senator Conroy for that. I think it is very important that the chamber does support the Labor amendment in full. Why should directors and chief executive officers, some of whom these days are getting $3 million, $4 million or $5 million a year, not have due regard to and take active consideration of all the relevant issues and information when they make decisions on behalf of their corporations? Of course they should. There are harder tests than that for many a public servant. If it is good enough for the public sector, then it is good enough for the private sector.</para></talk.start><para>This morning I raised the matter of political donations. Under current rules, I think the good faith of directors is not required to be exercised on behalf of the company, at least 
 in a way which is stated on the balance sheet when it comes to making political donations. These are made frequently. They add up to tens of millions of dollars. They are made to political parties without any written commitment but with the expectation that there will be some advantage to the corporation for having made that donation. I believe this matter should be referred to shareholders, and the chief executive officers involved should have to point out what exactly it is that they expect to get in return. As I said this morning, I believe the system is corrupting.</para><para>The provision hereâthe government provision which is supported by the Democratsâthat a director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith in what they believe to be in the best interests of the corporation I believe allows anything to go. In a court of law a director or chief executive officer has to establish that she or he believed it to be in the best interests of the corporation. That is a free run. We need a much tighter provision. We need much more clarification in the corporate law for the directors and officers involved. Good faith of itself is a direction, but it is not as specific. The Labor amendment is actually very minor, but it does tighten up what is meant by `good faith' or what is required of a director or other officer acting in good faith. I support it.</para><para>I note that Senator Conroy has flagged a further amendment if this one fails, and that is to remove the loophole allowing directors and senior corporate officers to say, `Well, we acted in good faith because we thought we were acting in the interests of the corporation.' Could you imagine any director or CEO going to a court and saying, `I thought I was acting against the interests of the corporation'? Of course they are not going to. You cannot get into the mind of such a person to establish the truth or otherwise; you have to  accept their word. So this provision as it stands allows anything that goes. All the director or CEO has to be able to say is, `Oh, when I did it, of course I thought it was in the best interests of the corporation. Of course I thought giving myself a package of $1 million per annum was in the interests of the 
 corporation because it would raise my work output. Of course I thought that giving a donation to this or that political party was in the interests of the corporation because it would help the political party that we favour get into power.' These things need a much stronger test than that.</para><para>As I said this morning on the second matter, political donations, when the government brings in more relevant legislation, flagged for later this year, I will be moving that the views of shareholders have to be canvassed before corporate donations are made. I will be interested to hear whether the government thinks that isn't a matter of good faith towards shareholders in this country. Of course it is, but the government will say that it believes it is not necessary to make such a provision. They will use the very loophole that is in this legislation now to get off the hook in defending the huge political donations made to political parties from the corporate sector in the interests of currying favour, but against the interests of shareholders in the main. So I support the Labor amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>9626</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Brown for a very clear description of what the government had been seeking to achieve.

These amendments are consistent with the decisions of the courts. They are well established and accepted judgments.

The government is opposed to these provisions, particularly the wording of the amendment in relation to recklessness. The amendment moved by the opposition seeks to put into the provisions 
 relating to good faith the words `intentionally reckless' or `intentionally dishonest'. Any plain English reading of this would effectively render it nonsensical and, therefore, unworkable. It is by definition impossible to be intentionally reckless. Our legal advice is that the effect of making this change would be to lower the burden of proof, lower the requirements, on a director. Because of its nonsensicality and therefore unworkability it would be virtually impossible to make out a case and achieve a guilty verdict.</para></talk.start><para>The burden of proof is for the prosecution to prove that a director has been intentionally reckless before they can be found guilty. As I have said, this is actually a watering down of the current standard of good faith. So we are strongly opposed to this. We think that it is a significant reduction in the balance between shareholders' rights and directors' duties. It is a significant watering down of the directors' duties under these provisions.</para><para>In relation to (4), the reliance on information provision, this amendment is unnecessary and could defeat the whole purpose of the main provision, which is to allow directors to rely on experts where it is reasonable to do so. Clearly a court could not find it acceptable for a director to blindly rely on expert advice where the circumstances may indicate that the advice is unreliable.</para><para>The government is very strongly opposed to these provisions. We think that in the very important balancing act in the incredible array of discussions that have taken place, not only in the last two years but alsoâand I do not say this at all flippantlyâin all of the discussions on directors' duties, the common law development of directors' duties and the development of the black letter law that has  occurred through those committees, such as the Cooney committee in 1989 and the Lavarch committee in 1991, you are always trying to find a way to ensure that both the common law and the black letter law in the statute impose very important obligations upon directors who do have that fiduciary responsibility. The government's advice to the Senate is that this wording would significantly 
 reduce a director's obligations under the law because it is nonsensical and unworkable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>9628</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I come to a view on this matter, I would like to ask the minister two questions arising from the remarks he has made. Parliamentary secretary, I am not sure whether you would remember a famous daredevil American called Evel Knievel. Evel Knievel was likely a corporation in his own right because he earned a great deal of money doing extraordinary stunts. I would suggest to you that any person would have regarded what Evel Knievel did as intentionally reckless. I do not know how else you would describe somebody who went whizzing over ravines and canyons all in the interests of earning money for his corporation. The reason I raise such an example is that, as I was sitting here, it was the only example which jumped to mind of the potential for somebody to be legally defined as intentionally reckless. I would have some difficulty in imagining a judge could not view the actions of somebody like Evel Knievel as reckless and intentionally so. He did it to raise money. I do see that there is a link in those words, but he was not dishonest in doing that.</para></talk.start><para>Quite frankly, if I had money invested in the Evel Knievel corporation, I would want him to limit the extent of his intentional recklessness so that, if he was going to jump over buses, he should jump over 50 buses, not 100.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âBut being reckless was his business; that's the difference.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âWell, we are dealing here with Corporations Law, which is why I have introduced it. What I am trying to do is to give you an example of a situation where I could conceive that lawyers would be capable of defining `intentional recklessness'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second question I have related to your remarks is that in the Labor Party's amendment they use the words `intentionally reckless'. In amendment (3)(1) they say:</para><para>A director or other officer of a corporation commits an offence if they:</para><para>(a)	 are intentionally reckless; or</para><para>(b)	 are intentionally dishonest. 
</para><para>I would have thought, if you have problems with the word `intentionally' attached to `reckless', you would have the same problems attached to `dishonest'. So I would like to know whether that is a problem for you as well because I cannot conceive of anybody being dishonest unintentionally. Surely you have to have an intention to be dishonest. The problem may in fact be Labor's addition of the word `intentionally'. My question to you is: would you accept the Labor amendments if the word `intentionally' were dropped from both the reckless and the dishonest subclauses? While I can see that somebody could be intentionally reckless, I suspect it would be a tautology to believe they could be anything other than intentionally dishonest. To be dishonest is an intention. I hope that fairly lengthy exposition is clear to you. I would like your response to those remarks.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9628</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am happy to respond because I think it is important. The Evel Knievel example makes the point that a lot of people could try to copy Mr Knievel and would simply just be recklessâthey may be slightly intentionally reckless. At the moment, a director just has to be reckless and gets himself off the hook if he is not intentionally reckless. So we are significantly reducing the standard of behaviour that is required of directors. To answer the question, I think the word `intentionally' is nowhere near as problematic when it is attached to the word `dishonest'. It does not change things so much.</para></talk.start><para>The government is opposed to fiddling with the wording here because there is a balance that has been sought in all of these changes with the business judgment rule and the statutory derivative action. There are a series of balances and, when you slightly tamper with words that relate to duties of directors, you can collapse a set of dominoes that could end up in a serious undermining of the law. I am informed by my legal eagle experts that the word `reckless' is something that has had a legal definition that has been built up in case law over 100 years. To then attach the 
 word `intentionally' to it would necessarily significantly change that body of law in relation to good faith and directors.</para><para>The key point is that to be reckless is the test at the moment. To then say to the court that it must also prove that a person has been intentionally reckless makes it a lot easier for a director to get off the hook. He or she could say, `I admit to the court that I was reckless. I was totally reckless. I flew the company motorbike over the Grand Canyon. That was totally reckless. But I did not intend to do it. I was actually trying to drive along the road. I took the wrong turn and I went over the Grand Canyon. It was not my intention to be reckless.' A director says, `Yes, I was reckless; I didn't intend to be', and he is off the hook. That is the point I seek to make. That is why the government regards this as a serious undermining of the duties that the law puts on directors at the moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>9629</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPerhaps I am a little more perplexed now. As I understood the parliamentary secretary's earlier submission, he was saying that it was a nonsensical provision when you put the two together. Then after Senator Murray's additions his position appears to have changed. He is now arguing that it would be a watering down, or at least a different reflection upon it, or someone might then get off. The parliamentary secretary then mentioned that he had it on some authority that it was a nonsensical provisionâin other words, that you cannot put `intentionally reckless' together in the same phrase. I wonder what authority he was relying on when he made that statement.</para></talk.start><para>As I understand it, a person can be intentionally reckless. I am open to persuasion in that respect, but some of the case law that I can recall in the law of negligence was where a personâI cannot remember the name of the caseâmight drive a car without a steering wheel and choose to use a pair of pliers to do the steering. In using the pair of pliers to do the steering, one would regard that the person intended to steer the vehicle and continue on their way. But it was reckless: there was an intention to be reckless in respect of that matter. That is as I understand the situation. 
 The amendment does not necessarily water it down. I would be pleased to receive a response to the issue that I raised about what the parliamentary secretary was relying on when he said that this was a nonsensical provision.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>9629</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe nonsensicality of it is that the person driving the car would be judged, under the existing provisions in this law, to be reckless. If you are trying to impose a standard on a director, it is nonsensical if you have to prove that he had some intention to do it. Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to reduce the standard of duty of care and the standard of good faith on a director? Senator Ludwig and I agree that getting into a corporate vehicleâtaking the analogyâand driving with a pair of pliers would be reckless, unless they were a damned good pair of pliers and were not going to slip, and he had a pretty steady head. Any judge in the land would say that was reckless. So why, if you are seekingâas everyone seems to be around this chamberâto make sure that directors act in good faith and have a duty of care, would you then say to a court that needs to impose that duty of care on those directors, `We are going to lift the bar.

Whilst I think there is a case for people being intentionally recklessâusing my exampleânevertheless, I do not think it adds anything and may take away, as you have outlined, from the ability to pin a director for offences. The Labor Party amendment would be improved if it just said `(a) are reckless' rather than `(a) are intentionally reckless'. I do not think we lose anything with that. With regard to paragraph (b) of the Labor Party's amendment, I believe that putting `intentionally' next to `dishonest' does not make any sense because you are either dishonest or you are not. So I would drop `intentionally' there too. As your advisers know, we have previously indicated to the Labor Party that we have sympathy with its amendment because we believe it captures all the elements of the government's amendment but has an improved layout.</para></talk.start><para>There are many phrases in both amendments which are exactly similar to phrases in the bill, but the differences are in the presentation of the government's first sentence. The Labor amendment isolates those items and presents them sequentially. That is a matter of style, but we felt it gave greater impact. The Labor amendment then proceeds to include the rest of your intention. So unless the government has a strong and vigorous opposition to it, we would suggest that the Labor amendmentâwith the deletion of the words `intentionally'âimproves both the layout and presentation of the government's clause in the bill without losing any of the strength of it. I would suggest the very valid point Senator Campbell has made about the word `intentionally' should be accepted by the Labor Party, and the word should be deleted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>9630</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should indicate that, following the discussions, we would happily accept an amendment from Senator Murray that removed the word `intentionally' from our amendments in both those lines.

This is an issue, as you know, on which all of us have been lobbiedârather late in the day in some casesâby the professional association who concern themselves with this matter. The effect of this amendment is to allow ASIC to determine the qualifications that a person must have to be appointed as the secretary of a public company. At present, the Corporations Law requires all companies to appoint a company secretary. This bill removes that requirement and replaces it with a requirement that only public companies must appoint a company secretary.</para><para>We have been lobbied to retain the existing requirement in relation to company secretaries. We do not see any real value in requir 
 ing all companies to appoint a company secretary, which was also the government's view. This is particularly the case in two-director, mum and dad companies. Quite often, that situation results in the mere nomination of a person as the secretary when that person may in fact have very little involvement in the company. However, we do see value in requiring public companies to appoint a secretary, who will usually have responsibility for ensuring compliance with all manners of statutes. I believe that there is merit in requiring the secretaries of public companies to have qualifications of a certain standard. However, I do believe that the approach to be taken to such a requirement must be flexible.</para><para>I do not envisage that the law should contain a section which states that a public company secretary must have a law degree or an accounting qualification; that was obviously the request of the professional association that looks after company secretaries. But I can envisage a situation where company secretaries in future might have entirely different qualifications, such as being very proficient with, for instance, computers. It should be the case that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission might periodically prescribe qualifications when and if they think that is appropriate. Accordingly, I commend this amendment to the committee as a means of improving the intention with standards in this area, without derogating at all from the government's intention.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>9633</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government does have concerns on a number of aspects of this. Firstly, the prescription of minimum qualifications in the law is potentially undesirable. The government has conducted no consultations whatsoever on this proposal. As all honourable senators know, it has been the practice of this government and also previous governments to have significant broad ranging consultations with stakeholders when there has been any change to the Corporations Law. That generally makes changes to the Corporations Law long and tedious, but it 
 usually ensures that there is a high degree of certainty about them. This change, therefore, would have the potential to create a great deal of uncertainty. We are not awareâcertainly they did not come to my attention during my term in the portfolioâof any failure of company secretaries to adequately fulfil their duties under the law. Accordingly, there seems to be little justification to impose the suggested changes at this time.</para></talk.start><para>I have not discussed this with the minister, and I do not want this to be seen as a fob offâit is a genuine offerâbut I am happy to have consultations on this matter. I am happy to have it inquired into either by a relevant parliamentary committee or even by a body such as CASAC, for example, if we do not want to leave it to a parliamentary committee. I am sure the minister would agree to have an independent expert body like CASAC look into this. As honourable senators who are interested in Corporations Law reform know, further bills are coming before this place over the coming monthsâif not the next year, at leastâand on behalf of the government, yet without consultation with the minister I represent, I would be happy to see this referred to a body such as the joint statutory committee or CASAC. I would be happy to hear other views on that, but I do not think it is particularly good practice to impose this new requirement without any consultations  whatsoever. We have reservations about it, but I am not saying that it is a bad idea. I am happy to consult on it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>9633</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI note that my colleague Senator Cooney also wishes to make a contribution, so I will be brief so we can hear from him. The Labor Party are genuinely supportive of Senator Murray's amendment. We think that there is an appropriate need for the right sort of qualifications for people who hold these positions. I have also been lobbied on this issue and I do believe that the company secretary has traditionally been a very important focus for these sorts of corporate governance issues which this parliament has seen fit to support. My concern with where the government seems to be going on this is that those corporate governance issues tend to find 
 a focal point in the position of company secretaryânot always, but they do in many cases become the focal point and the point from which good corporate governance practices come and are dealt with in a corporation. To have them dispersed within corporations, certainly the large ones, would in my view be a retrograde step, but I accept the points that Senator Campbell has made and that Senator Murray has made in terms of small companies. Having the position of a company secretary can sometimes cause stretching of resources in the mum and dad partnership company structure.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Campbell, I do support and welcome your suggestion that it be referred to a committee. I would like to see both CASAC and the parliamentary committee involvedâor perhaps CASAC could make a submission to the parliamentary committee on this. As I indicated to you privately a minute agoâand I am in no way reflecting on your wordâyou recently made an offer on behalf of the government to do with supporting the re-establishment of the Patrick issue. Senator Murray sat through a very tedious discussion of this at the recent Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, as I think did Senator Cooney. When I sought to re-establish the Patrick issue, which you had offered support for, government members and senators on that committee voted me down. I urged them to consult you on this. I said that this was an offer made on the floor of the Senate by Senator Campbell on behalf of the government and that all I was seeking to do was to get them to keep the commitment from Senator Campbell.</para><para>Senator Campbell, you are nodding, so you are aware of the particular debate. I was particularly disappointed that, when I sought to re-establish the reference, which was agreed to in this chamber, by dint of the election coming along the government members and senators voted me down. While I in no way doubt your word on it, I have unfortunately had a recent experience on that reference where your members and senators did not keep the government's word and the word that you gave. I would be keen for you to indicate that my recollection and, as you seem 
 to be nodding, your recollection that the government made a commitment to hold that inquiry is correct. I will take on face value your commitment to refer that matter, but I also draw to your attention the fact that, unfortunately, some members and senators did not keep your previous commitment on that Patrick debate. I urge you to speak with them so that, if I were to move that again, I would have the support of the government members and senators on that committee.

That submission was somewhat self-serving, as you would expect. They are looking after their own self-interest, and there is nothing wrong with that. What they were saying in their submission is that the law should be prescriptive as to not only what entities should have company secretaries, to a far greater extent than the government has suggested, but also the qualifications and duties that those company secretaries should have. We, the Democrats, took account of the government's view that they wished to avoid as much prescription in there as possible and we understood that they are seeking to allow companies, through their boards, to determine who does what and what are the appropriate qualifications that are relevant to those boards. However, we accepted that the company secretaries have traditionally had a very important role in the focus that they put on corporate governance, on dealing with legal issues and on dealing with accounting issues 
 in a particular professional way. In other words, they are often the ethics commissioner, the attorney-general, if you like, of a board, with that kind of brief to be both independent and objective in the pursuit of their duties.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To return to your question, if we agreed with the government that we should in fact avoid prescription but we agreed with the company secretaries that you should have persons of appropriate qualifications, and we could also envisage a situation where the appropriate qualifications could change over timeâand I gave as an example that it might be extremely important for persons with that function to be highly proficient in interactive computer skillsâand if there was a desire to maintain high professional standards then the best body to determine that would be ASIC, who would obviously do it in consultation with the professional associations that determine these things. Otherwise, like the lawyers, who have this kind of closed shop device whereby they determine their own background and destiny and how things get alongâI am not saying this to dig into your ribs; I am merely saying that they have got a superbly organised closed shop, in my opinionâthe Institute of Company Secretaries would continue to run things the way that  suited them and their people best. So my view is that ASIC, as the professional body with real authority and understanding of Corporations Law, is the appropriate body to lay down appropriate qualifications, after consultation with the professional bodies that are concerned, which is not just the Institute of Company Secretaries but would include the Institute of Company Directors and any other body that they thought appropriate.</para><para>The second thing I should say with regard to the parliamentary secretary's remarks is that I should have made it clear in my exposition of the arguments for this amendment that I have used the word `may'ânot `must', `may'âbecause ASIC may take the view that the qualifications and standards being pursued are perfectly reasonable and acceptable at this time, but in five or 10 years time they may not take that view. They may then decide that they need to beef up ethics and standards by 
 perhaps being a little tighter with their recommendations on qualifications.</para><para>I hope that fairly fulsome response gives you an understanding of my reasons. You might not agree with them, but hopefully you now understand what my reasons are. They result from a very considered response to interviews with, and a very detailed presentation in the submission from, the Chartered Institute of Company Secretaries. It is not something that we just dreamt up as we went along. That is the purpose of it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>9636</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat Senator Murray has said is that you should not leave these things to the profession, and that is more and more the way these days. In Victoria, for example, you now have all sorts of bodies set up to regulate the legal profession. But all those bodies have the purpose of looking after the profession in the sense of regulating itâlooking at standards and what have you. We do not have the Victorian police determining the qualifications or experience that a person must have to be appointed a lawyer in Victoria because the Victorian police have a different function. Senator Murray said that he has discussed these issues with the Chartered Institute of Company Secretaries and so on, so this is a planned thing.</para></talk.start><para>But as it stands there now you have the strange situation where the contents of, and the qualifications and experience required by, a profession have to be determined by what is in effect a regulatory bodyâa body that polices a particular section of society, namely companies. That seems to me to be a  different function altogether from that of setting qualifications and experience. ASIC might set standardsâin fact, it does. It says, `You've got to come up to this level of action for it to get past our scrutiny.' But we are not talking about actions here or conduct; we are talking about qualifications and experience. How people at ASIC, with all their goodness, can sit there and judge the experience of a company secretaryâhow they have the time to do that, for a start, in the way that we would want it done hereâseems very interesting to me. </para><para>The other point I want to make is this: when they regulated the profession in Victoria, as Senator Murray said, they did so with a fairly thick bit of legislation, because it is a much more complicated process than simply putting a couple of lines in a general act, may I suggest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>9636</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy comment comes on the back of what has already been put. It is an interesting point that is being made. When you look at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, they are, as Senator Cooney has pointed out, a regulatory authority. One would then have to look at whether or not to come to the conclusion that ASIC should have the ability to set or determine qualifications. One would have to be able to look at ASIC to determine whether or not they have within their own ranks people who have the necessary training and ability to set and determine competency levels and qualifications, to then put them into effect and to require people to determine those qualifications for the secretary's position.</para></talk.start><para>In addition, it is important to look at putting those two functions togetherâthat is, both the policing or regulatory authority and an auth ority that would also look after the qualifications. As far back as the Robens committee of inquiry in England, they put forward the notion that you should separate both the policing and the regulatory authority so that there was at least a separation between the two. Otherwise, you run the risk of having someone who not only regulates but also enforces sitting in the same chair. It has always been decided, at least from a Public Service perspective, that it is far better to be able to separate them for scrutiny and for a whole range of other reasons.</para><para>Senator Murray raises an interesting question. He raises the fortunate issue that ASIC `may' determine the qualifications. I found through my experience that usually if you put `may', ASIC will read that as `must' and will launch off and do that. I could not imagine them being reticent about setting qualifications. It then does not provide an idea of what those qualifications, the criteria and other matters involved in determining those qualifi 
 cations for a company secretary might be. So I would caution against moving directly as Senator Murray has suggested without, at least, far more consideration of the issue than what is being given here today.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the amendment moved by Senator Murray be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âWe now move to opposition amendments Nos 5 and 6 on sheet 1414.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>9637</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like  to make an intervention.

The current Corporations Law regime already 
 allows such action, but the process to do so is not clear and it is not often used. There is a widely held view that, without clear statutory procedures, pursuing a derivative action will continue to be a confusing exercise.</para><para>However, the opposition believes that the statutory derivative action rule proposed by the government is likely to be too onerous for individual investors to utilise. It is doubtful whether many shareholders will be able to meet the onerous requirement of applying for leave from the court to take action. The ineligibility of ASIC to apply for leave from the court is difficult to understand. As the government created consumer protector, ASIC should surely have the power to act under these provisions. Labor accepts that it would be appropriate that the right to take a statutory derivative action should be extended to ASIC because small shareholders may not have the resources to take such action. The opposition's amendment is designed to ensure that this can occur.</para><para>It was the opposition's initial understanding that the government had indicated an intention to accept a recommendation of the joint parliamentary committee report to allow this to occur. If this is still the case, I look forward to the government's support for the amendment. Our amendment to allow ASIC, which is the government nominated consumer financial services protection agency, to have the right to pursue statutory derivative actions on the behalf of shareholders will extend consumer protection and improve the accountability of directors. While the government claims that its proposal to allow shareholders to take a statutory derivative action will balance the so-called safe harbour provisions, it is clear that the government's proposal does not balance the ledger at all.</para><para>Labor's amendment will go some way towards achieving appropriate rights for shareholders. With the government trumpeting its support for Australia as a shareholding nation, I would have thought that it would support a regime that provides an appropriate level of protection for the thousands of new and somewhat inexperienced shareholders who have entered the market.</para><para>I recently attended a two-day seminar on corporate governance and a whole variety of issues to do with corporate governance, including some discussion on the statutory derivative action. One of the nation's largest legal firms was the speaker on this issue at that conference. I think it would be fair to say that this company did not realise that I was in the audience because, when asked about the statutory derivative action, the response from one of the leading law firms of this country was that the statutory derivative action as defined in this bill was a joke, it was irrelevant, and it would be something which companies could ignore at will. This is not the Labor Party saying this; this is not the Democrats saying this. I say to Senator Murray and the Democrats that this was a leading Australian law firm which said it was a joke. So the government come before us today and say that this is the balance for the safe harbour, but this is no balance at all. In its current form it does not go anywhere near far enough. It is rightly being treated and described as a joke in business and legal circles. For the government to try to maintain the fiction that  it is an appropriate level of balance is just thatâa fiction.</para><para>I commend the amendments to the Senate, and I look forward to hearing the government's position. As I said, they did indicate earlier on that they may be willing to support the amendments. I am not sure where they are at the moment. I am hopeful that the Democrats are also willing to support our amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>9638</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI fully trust what Senator Conroy is saying about a supposedly major senior law firm in Australia, or at least a spokesman for it. We genuinely try to balance the BJR proposals against the statutory derivative action. It is a genuine, quite clear and constructive move towards giving enhanced rights to shareholders to take actions on behalf of the company at the company's expense where the company refuses to act. Beyond any doubt it is a new right. People might argue about how much the 
 right will be used or how it could be curtailed. We went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that it was a significant new statutory right for shareholders, particularly minority shareholders by definition.</para></talk.start><para>It is fair to say that during those consultations interests associated with company directors, right up until the final drafting of the law, fought hammer and tongs to not have a statutory derivative action. The company director side of the argument did not like this; they did not want it. They thought they should have a business judgment rule, that that was all okay, but they did not want an SDA. I think people like Senator Cooney and probably Senator Conroy and Senator Murray, who have had discussions with the various stakeholders in this debate, would not be surprised that I say that. The company directors would much prefer not to have the statutory derivative action. Generally speaking, it is fair to say that some of the minority shareholder interests would prefer not to have the BJR.</para><para>We looked very carefully at the proposals in the Cooney committee, the Lavarch committee and other committees outside the parliament for a business judgment rule. I know that proposals for an SDA, a statutory derivative right of action, were also considered because I read the Lavarch report again today. I cannot remember whether Senator Cooney's committee looked at a SDA when they were considering a BJR. I apologise to people across Australia who are tuned into this lively and interesting debate on Corporations Law reform for using those acronyms. We put the SDA in to create a balance. The achievement of the government is that everyone, including the Australian Shareholders Association and other consumer organisations, has agreed that we have found a fair balance.</para><para>To answer Senator Conroy's point that we could toughen this up by giving ASIC the right to use it as well, I did, as he would expect, raise this matter over the couple of years it took to draft these laws. It is a quite legitimate proposal. I discussed it closely with ASIC, who were totally sanguine about it. They were sanguine about it for this reason: 
 under section 50, for example, they can already take action on behalf of investors. With the statutory derivative right of actionâthat is, giving a statutory right of action to shareholders to take action against directors on behalf of the company or against the company using the company's resourcesâwe are giving a right to the shareholders that, at the moment, is only available to the regulator.</para><para>During my term in the portfolio, I received many lettersâas I am sure all of us who have been associated with corporate affairs will haveâfrom disgruntled shareholders who want ASIC to go after someone. ASIC have limited resources; they always have limited resources by nature. They can only go after the ones where they are pretty certain of getting a prosecution. Like any organisation that has limited resources, they cannot chase down every rabbit hole, every complaint from every disgruntled investor. We would love it if they could. What this does is say to those shareholders that, if you can get an action together, if you can get together as a group of  shareholders, you now have this right to do so under the law. You do not have to do it through the civil provisions.</para><para>ASIC's powers are the focus of the amendments moved by Labor. As I said, I did have a close look at it. The government closely considered whether, firstly, ASIC needed or wanted the powers. We discussed and debated that with them closely. We discussed it with other stakeholders. We found that, under section 50, ASIC could already take action on behalf of shareholders and could also bring proceedings directly for any breach of the law under the civil and criminal penalty regime of the Corporations Law. The point I make, as briefly as possible, is that ASIC do not need this power; they already have it. What we are trying to do is give shareholders' minority interests access to the sorts of powers under the law that ASIC already hold. That is the government's view on it. We see nothing wrong with the intention of these amendments moved by Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition, but we do not think they achieve anything.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>9639</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to speak to the point you 
 raised regarding section 236. As I understand it, you are effectively saying that it is a positive advantage; you are broadening the proposal to allow a court appointed investigator to be able to investigate the causes of actions and report back to the court itself. Recently I read an article from the CCH Internet site written by Russell Evans and headed `Court appointed investigators in statutory derivative actions'. It states:</para></talk.start><para>Left unaddressed is whether an investigator becomes an officer of the Court by virtue of his or her appointment. And, if so, could a person be in contempt of Court by refusing to co-operate with an investigator? Will an investigator have privilege?

As we know, the rule in Foss v. Harbottle has practically done away with the statutory derivative action provision that you are intending to use.</para><para>If it is the case that a person who takes on that mantle is able, by virtue of their appointment, to go in and do what is necessary, there is the question of whether they can go in fearlessly, with confidence and with the surety that they have things such as privilege or qualified privilege. They are fine points, but without that being made clear people will certainly be left in some doubt. Could the minister provide some information with respect to that?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>9640</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not think this particularly relates to the debate about the statutory derivative right of action that we are seeking to give to shareholders. As I understood the question, it goes to the rights of investigators who work for ASICâgoing back to the concept of the regulator also acting as the prosecutorâand whether or not that role is compromised in any way by these provisions. Perhaps you could clarify that. I do not see that the point you made is actually directly related to the statutory derivative right of action.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>9640</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSection 236 will permit specified persons to bring an action on behalf of the company or to intervene to take responsibility for proceedings of which the company is already a party. The person specified is `a member, former member or a person entitled to become a member of a company or related body corporate, or an officer or a former officer of the company'. Such a person will need to apply to the court for leave to bring or intervene in the proceedings. So it does arise directly within section 236.</para></talk.start><para>When you look at that situation, the court must grant leave if it is satisfied as to certain criteria, including that `the applicant is acting in good faith, that there is a serious issue to be tried and that the granting of leave would be in the best interests of the company', which is stated in section 237. It will also be possible for a further person to be granted leave by the court in substitution for the person initially granted leave by the court,  which is stated in section 238. Labor is suggesting that ASIC also be added as one of those bodies. The reason behind that, I suspect, is to ensure there is a properly resourced, independent appropriate body to look at it. Because of the way that the existing provisions are actually worded, I am left in some doubt as to the position of that investigatorâthat is, the person would then be able to do it without the amendments proposed by Labor.</para><para>I will go again to the questions that remain, which are, I understand, left in the body of section 236. Those questions are: if that person becomes an officer of the court by virtue of his or her appointment, could that person be in contempt of court by refusing to cooperate with an investigator, will an investigator have privilege and will an investigator be bound by an obligation of confidence? You can then look at the court's power to appoint an investigator, which comes up under `General powers of the Court', at section 241. That section says:</para><para>The Court may make any orders, and give any directions, that it considers appropriate in relation to proceedings brought or intervened in with leave, or an application for leave, including . . .  
</para><para>And it goes on with (a), (b), (c), and so forth. When you examine that provision you find that the court is required to make orders as to who is to be liable for the investigator's costs, although the court may vary that order at any time, which is stated in section 241(3). It goes on further. Part 2F.1A is silent on the question of whether a court appointed investigator is an officer of the court. I take you to 6.63, which is in the explanatory memorandum. It says that `a court appointed investigator will effectively be an officer of the court'. It does not say that they will in fact be an officer of the court; it just says `effectively'.</para><para>They are matters that have been raised in a number of articles that, as I have said, I have read in respect of this section, which I suspect has prompted our view be adopted that ASIC should be in there. I think it is entirely appropriate and that is the basis of the argument that I am putting to you. I hope that has explained, in short form I suspect, where I am coming from so that you can provide some light on some of those matters. I am asking: can refusal to cooperate with an investigator be a contempt of court? It is a serious matter that I think requires an answer in respect of those provisions under section 236, which has obviously prompted this side of the chamber to also include ASIC as part of the operation. I can go on with a further explanation, but I hope that makes it a bit plainer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>9641</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am clear. We were on slightly different wavelengths but we have now got into a simulcast situation. The position remains the same. I have listened very carefully and have understood the points made, but the government position remains unchanged. This is not a provision that seeks to give ASIC any alternative powers; it is an addition to the law which is designed absolutely to give shareholders additional powers. The law already sets out a range of powers and rights of action for statutory rights of action for ASIC in relation to a whole range of matters. This is a provision that is aimed fairly and squarely and unambiguously at giving shareholders a right.</para></talk.start><para>It does not inhibit shareholders running off to ASIC; it gives shareholders a special new statutory derivative right of action that they can take. They can go to the courts and if they can satisfy the courts in respect of the terms in section 236 and onwards that Senator Ludwig has already eloquently outlined and if they can meet what are very reasonable testsâit cannot be frivolous and it cannot be vexatious; they have to have a serious case to tryâthen they can do so. The company will pay for it and the court can establish investigators, and so forth. I hear what Senator Ludwig is saying. I have heard the argument before. I have heard the arguments back and forth about whether ASIC should be listed here.

Let me see how we go with this: a derivative action is a claim made through the courts by the shareholders of a company against the director of the company. The important point to note is that the action against the director is brought in the name of the company, not in the name of the shareholders. As a general comment, under present law, derivative actions are not permitted. That means that, if directors commit a wrong against a company and they decide that a company should not commence an action against themselves, the shareholders have no ability to commence an action against them in the name of the company.</para></talk.start><para>The statutory derivative action contained in proposed section 236 will allow shareholders to commence a derivative action against the directors in certain circumstances, and that is a desirable improvement to the law. In proposed section 237, derivative action may be brought only with leave of the court. The court must be satisfied that it is probable that the company will not itself bring the proceedings, that the applicant is acting in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the company that the applicant be allowed to commence proceedings, that there is a serious question to be tried, and that notice has been given of the intention to seek leave. These Labor Party 
 amendments propose that the right of a shareholder to bring a derivative action should also be extended to ASICâthat is, that ASIC should also be able to apply to a court to bring a derivative action. I see in this the following issue: shareholders have not had this right and now they are to be given this right. In other words, they have the ability to act in a way they have not before, and that is very desirable.</para><para>Parliamentary Secretary, is it your expectation in behavioural terms that, if ASIC were given the power, shareholders would not do anythingâthat they would demand that ASIC do it? In other words, that they would shift the responsibility and the cost from themselves to the government and ask the government to pursue a private action against a company? Is it a weakness that is at the core of this problem? I do not want to put words into their mouths because I have not heard them say it, but I assume the Labor Party are saying that there may be some shareholders who would not be able to get their act together, or who are very poor, or who would not understand how to do things.

It  is a new right. It will not matter if they are not particularly well offâand Senator Ludwig will tell you, I'm sure, that there are a lot of lawyers around who are looking to take casesâbecause all they will have to do will be to find a lawyer who thinks they have half a case. If they have a decent case they will get it into the court and the company will pay. So a lawyer who is looking to help the poor downtrodden shareholder is likely to assist if they, in their own judgment, decide that the shareholder has some sort of case under this law. The point you make in terms of the incentive for a shareholder to go running first to ASIC is a very valid one, and that is why we have been very clear.</para><para>We have looked at it very closely. It is not an ideological position; it is a practical position, as you have picked up, Senator Murray. It is a very practical thing. We have thought about it, we have looked at it and we have made the decision that this is for shareholders. We want to encourage shareholder activism, and this is a brilliant way to do it. It gives them a right to be active. They do not have to yell and scream at an AGM and be fobbed off and come back in 12 months time. If they are not happy they have this right, and they can take it.</para><para>It is a very good corporate governance measure. I will be watching very closelyâ 
probably more closely than just about anybody this countryâto see how often it is used and how successfully it is used.

Although I know that the company can end up paying for the action eventually, in the intervening time shareholders have to get together and risk a bit of money to get advice early on and get the whole thing processed. It is in that intervening stage that they would find it much more attractive to get ASIC involved in the early cost. That is true, isn't it? Although the company itself might pay for an action which does get into the courts on due grounds, it is the intervening phase which makes it attractive for shareholders to go to ASIC because they do not get involved with having to get expensive advice and to fund the early stages.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>9643</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSection 242 at page 85 of the bill makes it clear:</para></talk.start><para>The Court may at any time make any orders it considers appropriate about the costs of the following personsâ</para><para>which are then enumeratedâ</para><para>in relation to proceedings brought or intervened in with leave under section 237. . . </para><para>What I am advised that means is that even on the very first day of the court the person representing the shareholder or shareholders can seek costs and that the court under this provision has the power to make those cost orders on day one.

 its current form. That is why this Senate chamber was asked by the governmentâI think the Democrats, like the opposition, supported thisâto make ASIC the watchdog in this area.

What my amendments seek to do is to put on the table that ASIC has to do this and has to commit resources to it. I know resources are a constant battle, Senator Campbell. I appreciate the point you made earlier.  There is always a prioritisation. But to effectively give small shareholders the flick in this way, as you are seeking to do if you vote against the Labor Party amendment, is reprehensible. I do not believe it is in the interests of shareholders. I do not believe it is in the interests of all the mums and dads whom you and your government so regularly champion. As recently as yesterday, the Treasurer waxed lyrical about the 32 per cent of Australians directly owning shares, the 560,000 Australians who purchased shares, the 75 per cent of Telstra employees who took up shares.

If we are to have a law, it ought to be available to everybody who needs it. What often happens in discussions in this chamber is that various parliamentarians arguing around the chamber creates scenarios which 
 prove their point. That was done in this case. Senator Murray said, `What would big business people do? What would people with big money do? They would go to ASIC. Therefore, ASIC would have to spend money which would be better spent elsewhere and would, as it were, supplement with legal aid people who are rich and wealthy.' That ignores the fact that ASIC would have a choice. The section reads that a personâit may be ASICâ`may bring proceedings'. A person does not have to do so.</para></talk.start><para>If the amendments that the opposition proposes were carried, it would give small people, as Senator Conroy has said, the opportunity of making use of the proceedings that are now made available under section 236. Those proceedings are now going to be available to very wealthy people, but they are not going to be available to the mums and dads who are not wealthyâas has been said again and again during this debateâbut who now have shares. Australia has become a shareholding nation. Why should those people be denied the same opportunity that will be available, when this legislation is passed, to people with greater resources? Why should they be denied that simply because they do not have the money? That is a question that is asked again and again in the general law in terms of legal aid. This is not a matter of legal aid: it is a matter of enabling, in the proper circumstancesâand I would imagine that they would be very limitedâASIC to take proceedings that are appropriate. If you are going to give a right, make that right available to all people.</para><para>This is an important section. It is a section that gives people who are members of companies, or have been members of companies, a constitutional right, as it were, to do something about that company. This procedure is going to be very expensive. As has been said, first of all, leave has to be obtained and the person that seeks the leave has the onus of proving the various matters that are set out in section 237. That could well be an expensive proceeding. You have to prove, for example, that it is in the best interests of the company that the applicant be granted leave. Once that 
 leave is granted, proceedings, of whatever nature, must follow.</para><para>It is said that there are lawyers who do matters subject to results and that is so, particularly in matters such as criminal law or family law. But I do not know many big legal firms that tend to deal with company matters that would do these matters on contingency for small people. That is fair enough. They are big companies and they are handling big clients. To handle small matters like this would interfere with the general running of their practice. I am not condemning that. I might say that many big firms do give legal  aid in areas such as criminal law and family law. I am not in any way denigrating them. What I am saying is that the structure of their business would not enable them to do that.</para><para>Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could ask his advisers how an action such as this would affect the running of a company, what would be involved, what witnesses you would have to get, what the cost of it would be and what sort of evidence would be needed. Indeed, in their experience of having run these cases, can they say how long similar cases have run and how much those barristers that practise in company law would charge? Do they think that a small person would have not only the financial resources but also the emotional resources to go up against a big company which, I would imagine, would have the top people in the land acting for them, and do they reckon that would be a fair contest?</para><para>We have to remember that ASIC would make the choice as to whether or not it would take up such an action. It is not obliged to take up an action if it does not want to do so. We are talking about a couple of gateways for somebody who wants to bring an action against a company. The first gateway is getting through ASIC, which would be very difficult. The second is getting through the gateway of the court to get leave to take proceedings. The third gateway is the actual action that the particular person wants to take. It is a very complicated issue. To simply say that ASIC is going to become, as it were, the milking cow for very big people is an ab 
 surdâand I use that expression advisedlyâproposition.</para><para>If we do not include ASIC, it will mean that it is only those with the big moneyâand I have nothing against big moneyâwho will be able to take the action that is contemplated here. Small peopleâmums and dadsâwill be unable to do so for the reasons which I have already mentioned and which are fairly obvious in any event. One of the problems with that is that the law, therefore, becomes available to only a particular class of people. That situation is already occurring, and it is bad to add to it by legislation such as this.</para><para>ASIC is a body that would make a judgment as to whether or not it is going to go on in this area. We trust ASIC to regulate the corporate world; surely we can trust it to make a decision as to whether or not there is an action open to people who come to see it. Even if it does say there is, it might say, `Well, in any event, it is not the sort of action that we should spend money on because ASIC has a statement and a budget.' Indeed, if the government became a bit concerned about the way ASIC was going, all it would have to do is reduce its funds. For those reasons, I think that if we leave ASIC out, it will be a bad thing for the general running of the law.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>9647</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLet us recognise, if we can, some of the very real benefits of what the government have put in this bill and let us consider the Labor Party's amendment as seeking to add to that. We see here that under the present law and under the proposed law ASIC has numerous provisions under which it can prosecute directors for breach of their duties. It does have numerous provisions on which it can act in regard to its duties on behalf of the act. The section that Senator Conroy read out could be taken in another way and the government may have had that in mind. That sentence said:</para></talk.start><para>In this regard, a statutory derivative action has the potential to remove some of the regulatory burdenâ</para><para>not the prosecutorial burden, but the regulatory burdenâ</para><para>from ASIC by making it easier for investors themselves to protect the interests of a company. 
</para><para>When I read that, I thought it meant that right now ASIC are burdened by people coming to them and saying, `We have difficulties in our circumstances. Will you do something?' and ASIC sometimes canâbecause they have provisions, as you knowâbut quite often cannot. That is why I and my party welcomed this new provision 236 and the other provisions. It introduced an additional protection for shareholdersâan additional ability to get justice, to access the law and to progress their issues and their concerns to their satisfaction. When I saw that, I did not see it as ASIC saying, `Well, let's get rid of something we  used to do because we like to do other things.' I saw it as them saying, `Now we have got something whereby that particular problem can be dealt with.' I may or may not be right in that regard, but that is how I read it. I know that ASIC have been frustrated by numerous approaches to them which they simply could not deal with. Now this section 236 will allow them to be dealt with.</para><para>It has some really terrific features in it. The feature whereby the company will pay the costs for those actions if they get up in court is just fantastic. That is providing ordinary people with a cheap and ready access to justice. That is what I like about it. Then I look at the Labor Party's amendment. This is one interpretation; it may not be yours. My interpretation is that what they are trying to do is say,  `Well, here is a new provision which is good for shareholders, and particularly good for those at the lower end of the scale. Let us add to it by asking ASIC also to have this ability.' In other words, `You have got something good, but we want to improve it.' That is as I understood your recommendation. But when I looked at your recommendation, I was afraidâand I find it difficult to express this, and I hope I canâthat the consequence of your amendment may in fact not improve the government's proposal but diminish it, because it would in fact make shareholders less capable of taking responsibility unto themselves to get on with taking action where it was appropriate.</para><para>All of us get caught up in the description of mum and dad investors, with the kind of emotional and economic picture that that 
 draws. But I sense that first time or relatively new investorsâin this brand new participative world of capitalism that Australia hasâare often not the sort of people who go to ASIC or would go to the statutory derivative action procedures anyway, because they are just not attuned yet. I would expect this kind of action to be taken up by informed, motivated and somewhat more experienced investors who would start this thing and then bring the others with them. You cannot in this law take an action which just benefits you as a sole shareholder and that does not affect the rights of every other shareholder in that same class, because obviously it flows on.</para><para>My feeling with thisâand the judgment we have madeâis that this is an improvement to current law and practice. It provides an additional avenue of access for justice. My judgment is again that your motives in trying to introduce this are unquestionably good but it may have a consequence which actually diminishes the purpose of the government's amendment. That is why I am still inclined to vote against it. I do so for the reasons I have tried to express to you. I hope that you understand what I am trying to convey.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>9648</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat Senator Murray is saying to us is, `Look, I agree with what the opposition is saying. I want this new ability for shareholders to go across the board so that shareholders, no matter what their size, can exercise it. That is the principle that the opposition is putting forward and I agree with that in principle.' But I understand Senator Murray to be saying, `Look, I say that if you introduce this you are going to diminish the chances of small shareholders because they will go to ASIC and in some way their rights will be diminished or they won't have the ability to do what they will be able to do if ASIC is not there.'</para></talk.start><para>Painting that scenario is, may I say, painting a scenario which is unreal. The opposition, on the likely reality of what will happen, is in a much stronger position than the Democrats. That is where the difference between us lies: not on the point of principleâthe principle that everybody should be able to make 
 use of 236 when it comes into operationâbut on the factual consequences of that.</para><para>If you just think about it for a while, company law can be complex and is often very expensive to run. If I can speak through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Murray, it is a good provision, that is true, but the amendment moved by Senator Conroy on behalf of the Labor Party would make it better. No matter what Senator Murray may say, the reality is that, without that amendment, this good provision is not going to be  made as good as it might be because, just on the evidence we have got over the years, if you look at how people with modest means are able to bring actionsâsay people who are earning, in this context, $80,000 or $100,000 a yearâthose people will not be able to bring an action under these proceedings because they will not be able to afford it.</para><para>It is a bit like asking people to take libel actions. As Senator Conroy said, there is all sorts of terror in that when you have to get leave and you have to go to the action. It is likely that costs will not be awarded until the end. It says that a judge can award costs day by day. That is just an unreal proposition. What concerns me about this whole debate is that this is going to go through, it seems with the Democrats' help, on a number of scenarios as to facts which are just quite unreal and almost absurd.</para><para>Everybody agrees on the principle. Even the government agrees on the principle that people should have proceedings available to them now. What is at stake is whether or not these proceedings are going to be available to ordinary people. The way this is set up, they will not be. One way of making that available to people is by putting ASIC in there. ASIC is not going to bring in a rush of litigation. We rely on ASIC as a regulator; why can't we rely on them as a gatekeeper in this respect? It just seems very interesting that we do not.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>9648</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to respond to Senator Murray but, before I do that, I congratulate Senator Cooney on that contribution, which I thought was very positive and measured. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would say to 
 Senator Murray that I wanted to go to a point Senator Ian Campbell made on section 50, about which they seem to be saying, `It's okay, you've still got section 50.' I have section 50 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act here, and it reads:</para></talk.start><para>Where, as a result of an investigation or from a record of an examination (being an investigation or examination conducted under this Part or a corresponding law), it appears to the Commission to be in the public interest for a person to begin and carry on a proceeding . . . </para><para>The key test that is in here is `in the public interest'. If a little mum and dad investor comes along with a problem and wants to go to ASIC, under the law at the moment it has to pass a public interest test. It is very rare, between a combination of resources and the public interest test, to be able to interest ASIC.</para><para>So when the government says that there are these provisions, it needs to be fully understood that there is a number of criteria again that the mum and dad investor must pass before they can actually get the benefit of ASIC's support, participation and interest. I caution the government and those who argue that the existing section 50 is the catch-all that can protect mum and dad investors, because I do not think it is. There is an important criteria in here, which I do supportâthe question of the public interestâbut it should not cloud whether the mum and dad investor can get access to ASIC. Realistically, I do not think that this section allows that.</para><para>I want to turn to your argument that the regulatory authority, by being there, possibly diminishes the capacity to undertake this sort of action. I would endorse Senator Cooney's comments that this is a good thing. I do not think it is as good as you do; I do not think it is going to have the impact that you do. As I said earlier, I was at this seminar where it was quite clearly expressed by a senior law firm that it was a joke and that there was nothing for anybody to worry about. I introduced myself to the individual after he made these comments. He went white. I was quite entertained by it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âName him!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âNo, I would not do that to him. I do not think he realised I was in the audience, to be frank. There is a parallel circumstance with superannuation. There is a low cost complaints tribunal, which is accessible and available. There is equally a legal process that you can go through. People are not diminished by the fact they can get the low cost alternative; people are empowered by the low cost alternative.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While I agree with your assessment that it is a wonderful thing that the company is paying, getting to the starting point is where I have my real concern. If you cannot get to the starting point because you are just a battling mum or dad, or because you are afraid to put your house up, there is a disincentive, a deterrence, that exists. I do not believe it is a deliberate deterrence. I do not believe the government are putting it forward as a deliberate deterrence, but I believe they have put it forward from their blinkered view of the world that everybody can get access to the law. I do not believe that to be the case. I think Senator Cooney and other senators have long argued that an almost two-tiered situation is developing. There is not enough legal aid or understanding. I think that this will be one of those circumstances as well. I am afraid that that two-tiered system will discourage people from pursuing their rights. It is unusual to argue that giving an extra option diminishes the capacity to go forward.</para><para>I would put to you, Mr Temporary Chairman Bartlett, as a member of the Democrats, that the task is to educate people so that they are aware of their rights and of statutory derivative action and so that they are confident enough to go on the Internet and call it up and read it, if that is what they want, or go to the library and pull the book out and read it. The education should go to their private capacity and to their knowledge that there is a regulatory authority there so that if they feel they cannot pursue the case they can go to the regulatory authority and have it help them kick it off.</para><para>My greatest fearâand I am in no way trying to be critical, except in a generic senseâis that this view of the world that everyone has access because it is there is not 
 true. It is not the case in education, it is not the case in the law and it is not the case in a variety of things in the real world. This parliament has upon it an onus to look at what happens in the real world and the effect on people in the real world, and if there is an in-built disincentive we should recognise that and allow at least the option for an alternative. That is all this amendment is seeking to do: to create the option of an alternative to avoid and perhaps get around that disincentive. What is critical is the education process. True empowerment of the shareholders comes through education. It does not just come through getting a dividend cheque once a year. It comes through understanding their obligations and their rights and what legal avenues are available to them. That is true empowerment. It is not just having a share and getting your dividend; it is about participating, having the understanding to defend your rights and having access to the means to defend your rights.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That opposition amendments (5) and (6) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.

As I noted yesterday in my speech on the second reading, the opposition acknowledges that there are economic efficiency reasons for increasing takeover activity or at least the threat of it. But it comes at a cost that is potentially more than the opposition is willing to risk. The cost will come from the subversion of good corporate governance principles such as transparency, accountability and equity. No longer will there be an appropriate competitive regime for corporate control and, despite the proposed safeguards, shareholders will not get a better price than that obtained from an auction process. We will move to omit the mandatory bid rule so as to ensure that transparency in the markets is maintained. We oppose these provisions as we strongly 
 question the need for this new rule. We believe that it would lead to significant disadvantages and few benefits.</para><para>What does the government propose with this new rule? The government wants to give takeover bidders control of a target company before the market has been advised of the takeover bid. The government wishes to encourage bidders to try and lock up key blocks of shares before launching their takeover bid. The result of this proposal is that it could grant the bidder effective control of a target company before revealing its intentions. Why would some takeover bidders want the mandatory bid rule? They would have a mechanism to discourage competitors emerging in the takeover process. Under such an arrangement, competitive bidders and directors of target companies would have less time to appropriately respond to takeover bids. Discovery of fair prices would also be restricted, as there would no longer be an auction process.</para><para>The mandatory bid rule would not be consistent with the proposed operation of the new takeover panel, except for earlier amendments today giving an exemption on the grounds of unconscionable conduct, because the rule would go against the Eggleston principles, principles on which the proposed takeover panel would consider and making judgment on takeover disputes. It is important to reiterate what those Eggleston principles are. Some people think they are a bit old-fashioned, a bit old hat, but these are the principles that have got us through the Asian crisis and these are the principles that have instilled integrity and confidence in the Australian capital markets. The Eggleston principles require: that shareholders of a takeover target company know the identity of any person that proposes to acquire a substantial interest in the company; that target shareholders and directors have sufficient time to consider the offer; that sufficient material is provided to them to make proper assessment of the offer; and that all shareholders have equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of a takeover offer. The mandatory bid rule breaks these principles. The government is effectively sacrificing a lot in terms of good 
 corporate governance practices for potentially little gain in takeover activity.</para><para>Forget the mandatory bid rule. The opposition has indicated that it is willing to support the CGT concession on scrip for scrip takeovers. This, more than the mandatory bid, will raise takeover levels. If the new tax arrangement does not deliver then we might reconsid er opposition on the mandatory bid rule. But right now the arguments put forward on the mandatory bid rule do not wash with this opposition. Let me reiterate: the mandatory bid rule will not benefit shareholders. It will lower the share price of takeover targets; it will simply allow takeover bidders to pay a lower price. The argument that Senator Ian Campbell put forward last night was that what we aim to do is increase the market for corporate control. We want more competition and more pressure to be placed on directors, particularly at the big end of town. I could not agree with Senator Campbell more. That is one of the reasons why we support scrip for scrip. That potential for takeover, that competitive pressure, is critical to the good functioning of Australia's economy and the benefits that come from that.</para><para>But Senator Campbell went on to make a range of remarks in his speech which I believe do not reflect well on the intention of this bill. He talks about dopes who say, `I'll ring around and see if I can get a better offer.' There are dopes out there who may say, `I have a potentially controlling interest in a company and I'll take the first offer that comes up.' Senator Campbell, I believe you would be right in many examples. But there are examples where a good analyst can look at a situation and at somebody who controls a parcel of shares and say, `That person is under a bit of financial pressure at the moment. That person has a significant cash flow problem and they might just be willing to part with those shares for less than they would be able to get in the auction process.'</para><para>So you can have a situation where a vulnerable shareholder is in a position where they actually sell for lessâwhat you would define as a dope. But, because they are under some pressure for a whole range of other economic circumstances, they may be willing 
 to sell out for less than the control premium might otherwise be analysed for. That would mean that all the other shareholders get that same offer and so, while you may be able to argue that there are not that many dopes out there, this is not a question about dopes; it is a question about whether or not people are in a position where they are vulnerable at certain times of the economic cycle.</para><para>If there is a bit of a downturn, you could get a situation where companies need to restructure; they may need to make changes. Individuals may need to change their portfolios for a variety of reasons, and a good analyst will pick this and will be able to move in and get access to the key bundle of shares to transfer control at less than they otherwise would get in an auction process. It is undeniable that the auction process will get a higher price in the circumstances and it is for this reasonâas well as for some of the others that I have outlinedâthat we believe that the intention of this change is good but that the costs to the broader Australian community and to the integrity of the market are too great for us to go down this path.</para><para>As I have indicated, we may be willing to have a look at this down the track if this problem continues to be there. As for scrip for scrip, I think the government lauded it when the Ralph report came down. The Ralph report said scrip for scrip could double the amount of takeovers, and more power to it on that front. But, if for some reason that does not eventuate and that is a bit of government hype, then we may be prepared to revisit this issue. But at this stage those of us who want to see that competitive pressure and see takeover activity increasing believe that scrip for scrip is by far the measure that will most lead to that pressure. The mandatory bid has too many negatives to it and therefore we urge the Senate to reject it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>9652</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am going to make my remarks relevant to opposition amendments Nos 8, 7, 9 to 16, and 35 and 36, which are all in that block on the sheet, to get it over with and to get the understanding of what we are about. The opposition amendments relate to the deletion of all the provisions relating to the 
 introduction of a mandatory bid rule. At present the law provides that any person who holds less than 20 per cent of the shares in a company cannot acquire more shares if the acquisition of those shares would result in them owning more than 20 per cent of the company, unless they make a public offer to  purchase all of the remaining shares in the company. So, in other words, there is a mandatory bid rule at present which is of a different order.</para></talk.start><para>For example, if you owned 19 per cent of the shares in a company, you could not purchase another 1Â½ per cent unless you offered to acquire all the remaining shares in the company, and you must make the same offer to all other shareholders. What often results is that, when the announcement is made that a person is offering to take over the company and purchase the remaining 81 per cent, other individuals and companies make counter offers to buy out the rest of the company. This results in an auction for the shares in the company to the highest takeover bidder.</para><para>This bill proposes the introduction of a mandatory bid rule. This will allow a person to make a private agreement with another shareholder to purchase their shares which will take them over the 20 per cent limit. When that agreement is concluded, the purchaser is then obliged to make a full takeover offer to purchase all remaining shares in the company. This means that a person could, for example, start off holding 19 per cent of the shares in the company and then reach a private agreement with another shareholderâthe first sellerâto acquire their 15 per cent holding, taking them to 34 per cent.</para><para>It will quite often be the case that a 34 per cent holderâor whatever the percentage may beâhas effective control of the company and this will deter any other shareholder or potential shareholder from making a counter offer for shares in the company. The result is that there is not an auction process for control of the company because the takeover bidder has already been able to obtain effective control through the private agreement with the first seller. The argument in favour of the proposed mandatory bid rule is that it makes 
 company takeovers easier because the takeover bidders can secure control of the company privately before launching the full takeover bid. The suggestion is that the increased threat of being taken over applies pressure on managers and directors to perform better.</para><para>The government's announcement in relation to capital gains tax rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeover, which the Democrats support, will remove a substantial impediment on takeover activity. I take the view that this will have a much greater impact on takeover activity than the introduction of a mandatory bid rule. At this stage, the Australian Democrats will not support the introduction of the mandatory bid rule, but we may well be prepared to revisit this issue at a future time if it becomes apparent that takeover activity is suffering as a result of the absence of the rule.</para><para>Let me make it clear that we believe the government has made a good case. We have also had presentations from such informed professionals as the Australian Securities Institute and we are aware of overseas precedent in this area. However, the arguments against it are such that, at this time, we have decided to take a cautionary stance on this and to be careful about introducing something which may not be necessary additional to the other changes which, in terms of this bill and in terms of the proposed tax rollover relief for scrip for scrip takeover, will significantly increase takeover activity. Parliamentary Secretary, I know that you have a particular passion for this area of the bill. I believe it may be appropriate to revisit this issue after the new bill has bedded down for some time so that we can assess just how these matters are progressing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>9653</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make some quick remarks. The government, after over two years of very close consideration of this measure, is strongly committed to ensuring alternative mechanisms for putting pressure on directors. This is a measure that finds its most strong opposition 
 from the big end of town and directors who are comfortable in the knowledge that Australia's existing takeover laws do produce the odd auction here and there but more often produce takeovers bogged down in litigation within minutes of any bid coming to fruition as soon as the defence for the takeover cuts  into action. That is why under our regime so little pressure is put on boards in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The other people who oppose this are the sort of people who Senator Conroy met at that seminar the other day who went white. They are indeed the lawyers who make fortunesâmillions of dollarsâout of takeover defences. That is why we believe in a mandatory bid, which ensures that, under the Eggleston principles, all shareholders share in the benefit of the premium. We believe that shareholders will receive more offers because there will be more takeover activity. We know that a shareholder who has a stake that is likely to deliver control, no matter if they are under financial pressure, will at least be able to pick up the phone and phone around and seek to get a higher bid. We also know that the auction is not eliminatedâthat if someone else wants to buy that company, they can come onto the market and bid at a much higher price and seek to attract other shareholders with their bid.</para><para>But recognising that I have failed to convince the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party of the benefits of this, I do genuinely accept the Labor Party's view that they are prepared to look at this again. I accept very much that the Democrats have made a decision on balanceâthat they are not opposed to this, but they are not quite in favour of it. I also put on the record a letter that I have received today from Ted Rofe, the head of the Australian Shareholders Association, saying that they are not opposed to the mandatory bids. So this is the organisation that represents the minority interests saying that they are not opposed to it. They recognise that it may reduce the opportunity for auctions. I will quote from Ted's letter and I thank him personally for putting this on the record. He says:</para><para>We believe that the conditions proposed to be applied to the mandatory bid should provide adequate protections for minority shareholders. 
</para><para>Having said all of that, the government will proceed with this. We would like to have it revisited. We will refer it to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities so that it can be further considered, and we will bring it back at the earliest possible time because we think it is very much in the interests of minor shareholders and the whole economy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that section 614 and schedule 3, items 283 and 363 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para><para>Amendments (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Conroy</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>(7)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 124 to 125 (table item 5), omit the table item.</para><para>(9)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 137 (lines 7 to 14), omit subsection (2).</para><para>(10)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 139 (lines 18 to 23), omit subsection (2).</para><para>(11)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 140 (lines 20 to 28), omit subsection (3).</para><para>(12)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 142 (lines 10 and 11), omit the note.</para><para>(13)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 157 (lines 29 to 32), omit paragraph (g).</para><para>(14)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 158 (lines 5 to 7), omit paragraph (i).</para><para>(15)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 162 (lines 26 and 27), omit "or" and paragraph (d).</para><para>(16)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 187 (line 6), omit "This subsection does not apply to a mandatory bid.".</para><para>Progress reported.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>9654</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Bartlett)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Last time I spoke we were then right on the cusp of the shutdown of the smelting operations in Newcastle. I did indicate at that time that BHP 
 was now just a small player in the Hunter economyâthis was before smelting was shut down. It was at that time employing one per cent of the work force. It was only the third largest employer, following the Hunter Area Health Service and the university. I would  like to emphasise yet againâbecause this message seems to have been lost across Australia and indeed the worldâthat we were not shutting down steel production in Newcastle; just smelting. We were still employing 1,100 people in the rolling of steel and if you add in Tubemakersâa subsidiary of BHPâwhich then uses that product, another 600 again. There are still 1,700 steelworkers in Newcastle in the rod, bar and wire divisions and Tubemakers.</para></talk.start><para>When smelting shut down, 2,100 people were case managed by BHP in five streams through their very successful Job Pathways program. Twenty-five million dollars was injected by BHP, by the New South Wales government and the federal government to assist in the process of moving people who were losing their jobs onto one of these five pathways. At the end of this process, when it comes to looking at how many people are going to have some difficulty finding work, we come down to a figure of 600 direct employees and 100 subcontractorsâa total of 700.</para><para>Since I made my last matter of public interest speech on this matter, the shutdown has actually occurred. The press really tried to turn this into a bad news story and failed dismally. I was on Sky News, and they were carrying international images of the steelworks, my voiceover and funeral music in the background. But the image on the day was very different as steelmaking in Newcastle was shut down. The image on the day was of the workers coming out of the gate in quite a happy moodâalmost a party mood. You must ask, `Why not?' For some of them who had put in 22 years of service in the steel industry, they were walking out with superannuation plus $80,000 in severance pay. This of course is a great financial boost to the Hunter economy.</para><para>The mood of the day was best captured on the Channel 9 news report that night. A 
 reporter, obviously trying to get a bad news story, went up to one of the workers and asked, `Where to for you now?' and the worker said, `The Phoenix Club, mate, and it's your shout!' That sort of positive response helped kill the bad news story. BHP are to be congratulated on the management of this process. With such a good outcome, it is obviously an example of world best practice in the management of the downsizing of a work force.</para><para>It is a great pity that BHP did not give the same degree of thought or put the same effort into developing similar processes when they moved on to the next stage last week. They hardly let the people of Newcastle catch their breath before they announced, within one week of the shutdown, that they were going to sell off quite a considerable number of their steel assets. They are retaining some steel business. They plan to retain the Port Kembla steelworks, Coated Steel Australia and Asia, Steel Building Products Australia, New Zealand Steel and Steel Building Products Asia. These businesses employ 13,500 people, and they are part of the retained portfolio of BHP. They are divesting the Long Products Division, which is mainly based in Newcastle but has a number of other centres around Australia; Tubemakers; Structural and Pipelines Products; tin mills; Coated Steel Corporation USA; Steel Building Products USA/Pacific; and North Star. There are approximately 9,000 employees there.</para><para>When BHP made this announcement, they gave the civic leaders of Newcastle some warning and did call a number of us in to explain what they were doing. I expressed disappointment that they had made the announcement at a time when they did not have a definite buyer, thereby creating uncertainty, and that they were not prepared to stay in a comprehensive steel industry.</para><para>Over the last 15 years BHP have upgraded the Port Kembla steelworks. It is now the third most efficient integrated steelworks in the world. They closed down the ageing smelter in Newcastle and they still have a comparative advantage in  Whyalla, with high-grade, quality ore and at least 15 years supply of ore close to the mill. Those three 
 elements I have just mentioned provide the ingredients to rebuild a world-class, comprehensive steel industry. Unfortunately, with that sort of opportunity BHP seem to have lost the will to do that. Of course it is a commercial decision, and BHP have made  that decision in the context of a global steel industryâand they have every right to make that decision. They face intense competition worldwide; falling prices; increasingly demanding customer needs; the emergence of new low capital intensive technologies, particularly arc furnace technology; and the need for a relentless focus on cost reduction. The government cannot change that.</para><para>Kevin Maher, the head of the Ironworkers Union in the city, expressed the hope that the next buyer will be more committed to the steel industry. The good news is that BHP does not plan to shut down any of these businesses. What it plans to do is to sell them off. Announcing these initiatives on 6 October, the President of BHP Steel, Bob Every, said:</para><para>These changes give effect to the strategic objective of building on the company's strong position in minerals, while taking advantage of niche opportunities in steel. They are an essential part of BHP's evolution if it is to remain a global player.</para><para>These changes are not about closing businesses. They aim to focus BHP on operations that are consistent with portfolio objectives and to allow other companies, with different objectives, to bid for businesses that no longer fit the BHP portfolio.</para><para>The reason for the loss of will on steel by BHP is to be found in a speech to the Australian Investment Conference by the  Managing Director and CEO of BHP, Paul Anderson. The speech was peppered with phrases like `It will be a company focused on creating value for shareholders', `Focus on these activities that will accelerate growth in shareholder value', `We will continue to reduce employee numbers and strive for efficiency', `Cost will be king', `The response to globalisation is mega consolidation', and `BHP will be a natural resource company with a steel component'.</para><para>This shows the driving force behind BHP's quite proper commercial decision. However, I feel that the founders of BHP, Guillaume Delprat and Essington Lewis, would be 
 turning in their graves. They had a vision and they built, through the first half of this century, a vast industrial conglomerate, starting with minerals and then moving into mining and manufacturing. One hundred years later, BHP, the Big Australian, is shrinking back towards its beginnings.</para><para>If the new investors had lifted their vision above the short-term bottom line, they could have reignited that original vision. I hold hope that their limited vision of a company with a narrow base does not create long-term value problems for their shareholders. I also hope that their move away from a comprehensive steel industry, which in the future may not include high-tensile rod and bar products, does not create long-term strategic difficulties for Australia. The founders of BHP Steel, Delprat and Lewis, understood its strategic value when they built a comprehensive steel industry between World War I and World War II. It is a pity that this vision has been lost with the passage of time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>University of Western Sydney: Higher Education Research Funding</title><page.no>9656</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>9656</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the likely impact of changes to higher education research funding, proposed in the government's green paper on higher education research and research training entitled `New knowledge, new opportunities'. It is with concern that I rise to illustrate some of the potentially damaging consequences for Greater Western Sydney that will result from the implementation of the government's green paper. As a local resident and a duty senator for Western Sydney, I am particularly concerned that the proposed changes will inevitably have a detrimental impact upon one of the most significant institutions in the Greater Western Sydney regionâthat is, the University of Western Sydney.</para></talk.start><para>What seems to be clear from the green paper is the fact that the proposed changes to the funding formulae will lead to inequitable outcomes for universities such as the University of Western Sydney and will have a direct impact upon the Greater Western Sydney region. The bias in favour of the established `sandstone' institutions, contained within the 
 funding formulae proposed in the green paper, seems to deny the valuable research role that emerging universities like UWS can play. As a relatively young university, UWS has distinguished itself as an educational and research  centre of excellence and has achieved much for the people of Greater Western Sydney. It has brought high quality educational opportunities to the doorstep of one of the most dynamic, diverse and burgeoning population centres in Australia.</para><para>By all available measures, the University of Western Sydney has proven itself to be the leader of the non-technology, post-1987 universities. Some of the university's most significant advances in recent times have come as a result of its investment in developing a rapidly expanding research base. In recent times, the university has aggressively sought to attract increased external research income, with the result being a threefold increase in external research income in what is a highly competitive market. At the same time, postgraduate research completions have increased from zero in 1993 to 63 in 1998, with a 30 per cent increase in postgraduate students since 1995.</para><para>In actively seeking to develop its research base, the university has worked hand in hand with local industry. With 103 funded research partnerships with organisations in Greater Western Sydney and a tenfold increase in industrial research funds since 1995, the UWS research programs have become a showcase of what can be achieved when universities, local business, local government and local communities forge strategic partnerships. But, sadly, much of this fine work will be brought undone if the government proceeds with the recommendations of Dr Kemp's green paper. It is estimated that the reforms outlined in the green paper will have the net effect of reducing funding to UWS by at least $2.35 million per annum, or $7 million over the next triennium, with a corresponding reduction in postgraduate research places of up to 77 per cent in the second year of the reforms. In dismantling the university's fledgling research base, these reforms will ensure that the university will return to being just a purely 
 teaching institution rather than an innovative centre of academic research and excellence.</para><para>If implemented, the recommendations of the green paper will have a crippling effect upon the university and almost certainly upon the people of Greater Western Sydney. It is important to recall precisely why the Labor Party established the UWS in the first place. It was the Labor Party that created the UWS to expand educational opportunities for the people of Western Sydney. But if the proposals contained within the green paper are implemented, we will see those educational opportunities, particularly postgraduate opportunities, for the people of Greater Western Sydney diminished. These changes will deny the people of Western Sydney the opportunity to pursue an advanced education in close proximity to where they live and work. But the impact of these changes extends beyond the direct effect of the reduction in postgraduate places and an overall reduction in research funding.</para><para>Not only will these changes devastate the university's research base and close off educational opportunities for the people in Western Sydney; they will have a profoundly negative impact upon the communities surrounding these campuses. In areas such as Penrith, Campbelltown and Parramatta, local employment opportunities, the success of small businesses and the viability of developing industries will be jeopardised by the green paper's proposals. To proceed with the recommendations of the green paper will be to rip away the very foundations of accessible education in Sydney's west. After spending the last decade taking on the more established institutions and succeeding in a very difficult area of research and research training, the UWS is now being told by the government that it should not be in the business of developing a research base.</para><para>All this comes at a time when the government is mouthing the rhetoric of the `knowledge nation' and the need to invest in the knowledge based sectors of the economy. Here we have an example of where a university has succeeded in bringing together academia and industry in strategic alliances that have provided enormous benefits to local 
 communities; however, the government now seems committed to bringing an end to success stories such as this. It seems to me that the government believes in the benefits  of the knowledge based economy, but not for Western Sydney. It is true that these are only recommendations emerging from the green paper and that there will be a number of opportunities for the government to see sense on this issue. I must, however, express my complete lack of faith in the government when it comes to the likelihood of a policy outcome on this issue. To this point in time, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, has refused to even meet with representatives of UWS  to discuss in detail the impact of these proposed changes.</para><para>Given revelations about the minister's vision for higher education aired in the House of Representatives earlier today with the release of his cabinet submission, I have even less faith in the minister. A matter of even more concern is the complete lack of action of a number of the local representatives of the areas most affected by these changes. The two most affected areas include the electorates of Parramatta and Lindsay. Whilst representatives of the university have had the opportunity to meet both these members, neither of these members has taken up the issue with the degree of vigour that one would expect, given the profoundly detrimental impact that these changes will have on the people of the Parramatta and Penrith communities.</para><para>Whilst the member for Parramatta has chosen to ignore the issue, the member for Lindsay has hardly been convincing in her support for the cause of the university. If the member for Parramatta could reduce his point of order load to only one per sitting day, I am certain he would be better able to utilise his time representing the legitimate concerns of his local community.</para><para>Similarly, far from providing this critical local issue with her wholehearted and unequivocal support, the member for Lindsay is reported in the local newspapers as saying, `It's important all possible views are heardâthat's why I will ensure the relevant material will be considered by the right people.' Well, 
 the people of Lindsay deserve much better from their local member. These proposed changes will cause irreparable damage to their local community, will adversely affect employment levels and will provide an additional barrier to participation in higher education for people in her electorateâand the best that the member for Lindsay can do is to say that she will make sure that the university's submission is heard by the right people.</para><para>The people of Lindsay deserve more than a delivery service from their local member. They deserve a local member who will recognise that these proposals will be damaging to their community, and they deserve a member who will roll up her sleeves and fight for them. If the people of Parramatta and Lindsay cannot rely upon their local members to fight for their interests, who can they count on? Mr Acting Deputy President, I can assure you that the Labor Party will be fighting for their interests, because we will not let this government destroy UWS. We have fought too hard for educational opportunities for people in Greater Western Sydney to stand by and allow this ideologically driven government to dismantle an institution that is so critical to the prosperity of Greater Western Sydney.</para><para>If Mr Kemp wants to deprive Western Sydney of access to educationâand research funding to the University of Western Sydney is the battlegroundâthen I can assure you that the Labor Party will defend the interests of the west, with or without the assistance of its local members.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales National Party: 80th Anniversary</title><page.no>9658</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>9658</page.no><name role="metadata">Brownhill, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator BROWNHILL</name><name.id>RD4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe New South Wales National Party today marks its 80th anniversary as a political organisation. In the late 1800s and early 1900s there was a growing dissatisfaction that political parties of the day were ignoring the issues of concern to all but those living in the metropolitan areas. We were formed as a progressive party by the establishment of a central electoral council at a meeting in Sydney on 13 October 1919 of representatives of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the Graziers Association of New South Wales and the 
 People's Party of Soldiers and Citizens. We subsequently became the Country Party in 1925.</para></talk.start><para>The party has been continuously and strongly represented in the New South Wales and federal parliaments since its inception and has a proud record of achievement for its constituents in non-metropolitan areas. It is a record upon which we continue to build today. Over the years, many doomsayers have predicted the end of the Country Party, yet we remain strong, independent and proud. We continue to boast the largest membership of any political organisation in Australia.</para><para>The federal National Party will mark its 80th anniversary on 22 January next year. The strength of our history is a fundamental foundation that will ensure our continuing independent future. I pay tribute to all past and present members and supporters who have bound together to make us the great and enduring organisation that we are. On behalf of all my National Party colleaguesâand, I am sure, all the members of this chamberâI wish the National Party of New South Wales many more successful anniversaries.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nursing Homes: Care Subsidy</title><page.no>9658</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>9658</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to talk about a very important issue in the area of aged careâthat is, the findings of the Productivity Commission's report into nursing home subsidies. I must start by saying that the Democrats are very disappointed at the coalition's lack of response to the findings of this important inquiry. We had hoped that, in line with the stated commitment to improving the provision of aged care services, the government would have taken the findings of this inquiry much more seriously than it seems to have done. Not only has the government not responded but, despite receiving the findings of this inquiry in January this year, it has failed to give any indication as to when it will be responding.</para></talk.start><para>As I said recently in my second reading contribution on the  Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 , the Democrats believe that this is most unsatisfactory. It is yet another example of a government setting up 
 its own objective independent body to look into what needs to be done in the area of aged care, only to ignore its findingsâreminiscent, perhaps, of the way that the ALP ignored the recommendations contained in its Gregory report when it was in government, which the Democrats, amongst others, rightly condemned the now opposition for.</para><para>The coalition's failure to respond to the Productivity Commission's report on nursing home subsidies has left those with an interest in aged care with little option but to ask ourselves whether this is really just history repeating itself. The minister has said time and time again that the government will be providing a whole of government response to the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into nursing home subsidies, and that it will be made public in due course. However, despite these findings being released in January this year, we still have no idea when this whole of government response will be forthcoming.</para><para>Prior to the last federal election, there was considerable concern about the government's policy of coalescence in relation to nursing home subsidies. This policy will involve a reduction in subsidies for residents in nursing homes in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and the Northern Territory in order to provide more equitable subsidies to nursing home residents in the lower funded states of Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the ACT.</para><para>The Democrats were therefore very pleased when the government referred the matter of nursing home subsidies for independent investigation by the Productivity Commission. In announcing this inquiry, the then Minister for Aged Care, Warwick Smith, said:</para><para>The Government gives the commitment to all Australians that it will consider and respond to whatever the Productivity Commission finds.</para><para>The Productivity Commission consulted widely and after extensive consideration of the issues presented its recommendations to the government on 13 January this year. On receiving these recommendations, the government issued a press release saying:</para><para>The report endorses the government's intention to move towards uniform national subsidies for residential aged care.</para><para>Well, not quite, as it turns out. Anyone who has read the findings of this report will be able to attest that this claim is a very creative interpretation of the facts. It is a very creative interpretation of the facts because, rather than endorsing the policy of coalescence as the government has claimed, the Productivity Commission opposed it. It opposed the government's policy of coalescence because it is not based on a benchmark costing for a standard of care that would apply across Australia but simply on the average of current state subsidies. This is a very arbitrary kind of base with no real grounding in care standards.</para><para>What the Productivity Commission did recommend was a subsidy regime which provides a clear link to the standard of care which the Commonwealth is seeking and funding that is adequate to meet the cost of providing that benchmark standard of care. Based on the current variation in standardised costs among the states and territories, the commission drew attention to the inequitable underfunding of services in Queensland and South Australia and recommended that this be addressed as a matter of priority. The timing of the implementation of coalescence presents serious problems for the services. Equitable funding for Queensland and South Australia would not be achieved until 2004-05, making it very difficult for services in these states to achieve accreditation and operate viable services.</para><para>Urgent action is required if the government is not to be seen as placing a lower value on older people in these states and forcing aged care providers to eat into their capital reserves in order to maintain standards. Funding for services in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and the Northern Territory will be offset by eight per cent of the difference from the national average on 1 July 2000. The reduction in subsequent years increases to 14 per cent, 24 per cent, 24 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. Services will find it increasingly difficult to maintain quality of care under these arrangements.</para><para>A further recommendation of the commission was the introduction of revised indexation arrangements for nursing home subsidies as soon as possible. It found that there was an urgent need for special needs funding in high cost areas such as rural and remote areas to ensure that these older Australians needing care were not disadvantaged.</para><para>The whole point of the Productivity Commission inquiry into nursing home subsidies was to determine whether the proposed coalescence of nursing home subsidies should proceed or be replaced by another funding methodology. Yet despite the fact that the inquiry did not endorse the government's coalescence proposal in setting nursing home subsidy rates from June this year, the government went ahead with its proposal anyway. This is causing ongoing difficulties for many aged care providers, particularly in those states which currently receive a disproportionately low level of fundingâSouth Australia and Queensland.</para><para>At my request, leading peak bodies in the aged care sector recently met with me to discuss this issue. As a result of this meeting I can report that there is widespread support for the Productivity Commission's recommendations accompanied by a widespread concern at the government's failure to respond to those findings. The Democrats call on the government to end the current angst in the aged care sector by making it very clear exactly when and how the findings of this report will be responded to.</para><para>On International Older Persons Day the minister said that perhaps Australia doesn't value its older citizens enough. Surely this government does not wish to be condemned as devaluing older people through its inaction on the Productivity Commission recommendations. I therefore have no doubt that during this session we can work together to ensure that timely and appropriate action is taken on this matter so as to promote the wellbeing of frail older Australians and to demonstrate that they are truly valued by this government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales National Party: 80th Anniversary</title><page.no>9660</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>9660</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust a brief moment following Senator

We are the second oldest party next to the Labor Party, which is significant in that we have stayed the test of time. We are not socialists; we have always condemned socialism. Nevertheless, we did grow out of a need to represent the rural and regional areas and did support the statutory marketing authorities. That was very much the hallmark of the National Party, our philosophy base. Much has changed since thenâfor some of us, to our regret. Statutory marketing is a fair and fine philosophy which seemingly time has passed by for, in some cases, good economic reasons. But let us not get bogged down in that. This is just a jump up to wish the National Party happy birthday.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It could be interesting for those here to know that on average the National Party has held some 14 per cent of the parliament. We are not far from that these days. That is our natural position in the House of Representatives. For the federal party it is 80 years in January. We wish the New South Wales party its 80th birthday. The demographics, the seats, the voting system have changed. We now have one vote one value, where once there was a weighting towards the country people in electorates. That is a good thing and it would not hurt the parliament in celebrating our birthday to reconsider that.</para><para>You must remember that country people feel disenfranchised. One of the reasons is that they do not have the same political power as they used to because once there was an acknowledgment of the great distances out in the country regions and electorates were weighted accordingly. Now you have these 
 massive electorates which National Party members have to service because of one vote one value. The servicing of that ideal has become an enormous burden and to a great extent those voters have become disenfranchisedâanother issue for another day.</para><para>Again, I wish the New South Wales party a happy birthday. They have dominated the National Party in that time. Most of our leaders have come from New South Walesâour existing leader, our previous leader, the leader before that, and so it goes on. I would have to say our best leader came from Victoria, the most notable leader, Jack McEwen.
