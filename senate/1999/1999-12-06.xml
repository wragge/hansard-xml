</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 was introduced into the Senate on 31 March 1999. On 20 April 1999, the Senate, on the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee (Report No.6 of 1999), referred the provisions of that bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. That Committee handed down its report on 12 August 1999. The majority report recommended the bill proceed.</para><para>This bill, in identical terms to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999, was then introduced into the House of Representatives on 14 October 1999. It was designated the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill [No.2] 1999.</para><para>At the Senate Committee hearing of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 some community groups put the view that the proposal within the act that the Authority develop a work plan and be able to charge for the assessment of certain applications for variation of the Food Standards Code be subject to greater transparency within the bill. Amendments to this effect were moved by the Opposition in the House of Representatives. As these amendments broadly complement the Government's policy intent, the Government was pleased to support them. The amended bill is now before the Senate.</para><para>The amendments made by the House of Representatives clarify:</para><para>-	 the object of the act;</para><para>-	 the objectives of the Authority in developing food standards and codes of practice and the matters to which the Authority must have regard when developing these food regulatory measures;</para><para>-	 the method of notification to be used by the Authority in relation to the development of food regulatory measures;</para><para>-	 the type of work plan to be developed by the Authority; and</para><para>-	 the types of applications to develop or vary food standards for which the Authority may charge for assessment.</para><para>This bill will implement recommendations arising from several reviews which are part of a package of reforms which serve to strengthen and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the food regulatory system for Australia and New Zealand. These reviews are the National Competition Policy Review of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 (the Act),the Review of the State 
 and Territory Food Acts and the Food Regulation Review.</para><para>The bill amends the act in four major ways:</para><para>-	 it creates objectives for the act and clarifies the role, functions and regulatory objectives of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (the Authority);</para><para>-	 it provides the Authority with more flexibility and efficiency in its consultation and decision making processes;</para><para>-	 it enables the Authority to more effectively protect public health and safety and the prevention of misleading and deceptive behaviour; and</para><para>-	 it allows the Authority to charge for services in certain circumstances.</para><para>I will deal with each of these aspects of the bill separately.</para><para>Firstly, the bill includes an overall objective for the act in order to provide public transparency and accountability and a concise statement of the role of the Authority. Both the new overall objective and the recast section 10 objectives ensure that public health and safety and the protection of consumers remain the highest priorities of the Authority.</para><para>It will now be explicit that the Authority must consider the costs and benefits of the various regulatory alternatives that are available. Food standards should not impose undue costs on the food industry or the community.</para><para>The bill will also provide for greater consistency and co-operation at the Commonwealth level and between the Commonwealth and States and Territories in relation to food regulatory issues.</para><para>The Authority's need to undertake activities that support and improve the quality of food standards is also recognised in the bill. These activities include being an advocate for Australians in the international arena, facilitating industry guidelines and coordinating national work on auditing systems and training competencies.</para><para>I now turn to the second major aspect of the bill. It allows the Authority to be more responsive to community concerns about particular standards issues and develop tailored consultation arrangements for individual issues.</para><para>Over the years, the Authority has been locked into rigid and sometimes inefficient consultation processes. Regardless of the good intention behind some of these prescriptive requirements in the current act, it is clear that taxpayers' money has at times been wasted through lengthy periods of consultation on very minor issues. These amendments will allow the Authority to tailor consultation processes, allocate more resources where there are significant concerns and streamline processes for 
 minor issues whilst still ensuring that stakeholders have maximum opportunity to provide input on issues that affect them.</para><para>In having more flexibility to respond to consultation needs, the Authority will be more accountable to its stakeholders. It will need to prepare, in advance, plans that clearly set out the proposed consultation processes for each standard it develops or amends. It will need to discuss these with key stakeholder groups and ensure that no affected parties are overlooked.</para><para>Also included in the bill are amendments that will enable the Authority to deal more efficiently with less significant standards issues. Where the draft standards raise issues of minor significance or complexity, and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has approved a general approach to be applied in such cases, and no substantive objections have been raised in submissions, the Authority will not be required to put a recommendation to Ministers in relation to the approval of particular food standards. The Council will have the power to overrule these decisions, which would then be dealt with by the Council in the usual manner; otherwise, the decisions will stand as if they were decisions of the Council.</para><para>The act currently requires literally every detail of all proposed changes and additions to the Food Standards Code to be considered by all ten Ministers, even where they have already set down clearly the approach they wish to apply. This delays the process of making necessary but minor changes and wastes the time of Ministers when other more important food policy issues are waiting for their consideration. This amendment redresses that problem and should benefit both industry and consumers by significantly decreasing the time taken to make minor changes or additions to the Food Standards Code.</para><para>The third major amendment is to permit the Authority to more effectively protect public health and safety and prevent misleading and deceptive behaviour by allowing effective implementation and enforceability of the new food safety standards and permitting the restriction of sale and advertising of foods where necessary to protect public health. The bill also enables the Authority to approve specific brand or patented products or certain classes of food so as to ensure the safety and/or appropriate labelling of such products before their release onto the market.</para><para>I now turn to the final aspect of the bill. At present, the Authority is obliged, by its legislation, to process all applications on a `first comeâfirst served' basis, regardless of the degree of public health and safety and consumer protection involved. This can draw resources away from standards work that protects public health and safety and into 
 minor matters of little significance to the community.</para><para>The Authority will now be able to ensure that its government appropriated resources are primarily directed towards the protection of public health and safety. These amendments (similar amendments to which were previously contained in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996, which lapsed during 1998) will enable the Authority to charge for the assessment of certain applications.</para><para>The Authority will be able to charge for the assessment of applications for the development or variation of standards that, if adopted, will confer an exclusive, capturable commercial benefit on the applicant, and for the early consideration of other applications. These charges will be based on the amount of work involved in assessing such applications and will not be dependent upon their approval. The assessment of these types of applications will not delay the assessment of other applications.</para><para>The proposed cost recovery arrangements are fully consistent with this Government's user pays policy. The Authority will only be able to recover its costs and will not be able to make a profit. The Authority will consult with stakeholders when developing both its standards work plan and its cost recovery regulations.</para><para>Since the creation of the Authority in 1991 considerable progress has been made to develop uniform food standards throughout Australia and improve the safety of the Australian food supply. This package of amendments will allow the Authority to continue its reform of the food regulatory framework and develop a quality Food Standards Code which will serve Australia and New Zealand well into the next millennium.</para><para>I present the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>11153</page.no></debateinfo><para>A message received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendment made by the Senate to the following bill:</para><para> Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999

 He was of the belief that a conurbation, or what was an urban area from his perspective, was an area defined as `densely populated, which does not go, looking at the map, beyond what generally might be identified as the local government areas that surround the boundary of an urban centre'. Would Senator Kemp like to venture an opinion on that? We will keep coming back to this if we do not get any answers.

This is a new scheme. You are starting from a whole new base. At least the tax office have acknowledged that they need information to have some checks and balances in this process. It is that that I am asking you about. Suppose you have, say, a contractor working in forestry who has heavy plant and equipment that is used directly in the harvesting of trees, and the person also has a transport operation not just involved in the transport of wood. To my way of thinking, they couldâI am not suggesting they wouldâactually make a claim for diesel that is not being used in part of their transport operation. They could be using diesel, as I put to the tax office, because nearly all of them have diesel four-wheel drives, as do many of the workers. A whole new diesel usage could occur, for which claims for the scheme will be lodged and paid.</para></talk.start><para>At this time I cannot see, and I have not been informed of, any process of checking

The industry says that, if I am competing against a 4.5-tonne truck on the same routes, not only do I have a cost disadvantage but also my resale value has gone down substantially because I am not eligible for your grant, which goes to trucks above 4.5 tonnes. So, if I bought a four-tonne truck, has my resale value gone down? The industry says yes. Do you agree with the industry? You may shake your head, Minister, but these are legitimate questions for small businessmen in our state who are based in and around Melbourne. Before you did your dirty deal 
 with the Democrats behind closed doors on your original tax package, someone might have gone out and bought a four-tonne truck, and all of a sudden they find that the resale value has gone down. It is not a trivial issue to a small businessman, an owner-driver operator of a four-tonne truck.</para><para>Do you also agree with the industry when they said at the hearingsâI will quote from page 11 of the transcript:</para><para>The bus industry finds it incongruous that the direction of these changes is actually pushing people out of buses and into cars; yet we know that buses are, at worst, eight times more effective in terms of improving the environment than cars are.</para><para>You are a former shadow minister for the environment.

We know there is substitutability between buses and cars . . . so we are heading in the direction of pushing people out of the great bulk of the bus fleet into cars.

But since Senator Murphy was not here last Tuesday I will repeat some of what was said. The government are putting in place a strict verification regime because we do not want 
 the system to be rorted. We think the grants scheme will be good for Australia. We think it will be good for the trucking industry and therefore the transport sector and therefore the efficiency of the economy. But we want to ensure that it is not rorted. As the honourable senator opposite would know, the ATO is well versed in compliance action where there is a self-assessment system involved. We already have the existing example of the income tax system, which is a self-assessment system. The Australian Taxation Office systems in place for that self-assessment system are regarded as efficient and, in many respects, world best practice. The same office will be implementing this system.</para></talk.start><para> It would clearly be wrong for the commissioner to start from the assumption that every truck owner is going to seek to rort the system. The reality will be that most truck owners will not; most truck owners will work within the system, as they do now. I am informed that the commissioner has actually said this in relation to the tax paying community in general, and that is why we have self-assessment. On the other hand, we can rest assured that the commissioner will do what he has to to ensure that the grants scheme is not rorted. As we discussed at some length last Tuesday, both the bill and the explanatory memorandum contain details of the record keeping powers, and that was gone into over a period of a couple of hours last Tuesday. We went through the sorts of records that will need to be kept. We went into the powers that this bill contains to enable people to pull trucks over to the side of the road, which are very similar powers to those that exist in the fuel substitution act.</para><para>I am not sure whether the Labor Party supported that bill when it came through this place. You may not have. It may be the Labor Party's policy, which will emerge, I guess, at some stage before or after the next election, to roll back the new tax system. Maybe part of the roll back is to unwind this grants scheme and maybe to remove some of the verification procedures. I am not sure. You will obviously have to discuss that at your national conference and within the caucus. That may be part of the roll back, or the walk 
 back, that Mr Beazley refers to. Maybe you do not like strict verification and antirorting procedures within these sorts of legislative and regulatory regimes, but we think it is important that the scheme has integrity. This scheme and the powers in it to enforce the record keeping are provided to the commissioner to ensure proper enforcement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>11166</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI say to the minister, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that record keeping is one thing, but I gave an example both to the minister and to the tax office earlier about diesel fuel that is claimed as eligible for the grant but is used for other purposes. History will tell us that even with the diesel fuel rebate scheme there were problems and, of course, the then government moved to rectify some of those problems with regard to verification. But this is a new scheme. The minister has said, `Look, the tax office has verification powers and stands on its record.' I would suggest to him and to the tax office, with no disrespect to the tax office, that the self-assessment program that it has in place at the moment has its own problems, and some of them are quite significant and have been stated publicly with regard to an existing, self-assessment process.</para></talk.start><para>This is a new one. If somebody has an off-road operation, be it in mining, forestry or agriculture, where the diesel they purchase is eligible for the DFRS, or could be eligible under this new grants scheme, and it were to be used in another aspect of the company and/or the person's businessâthat is, where it would not be eligibleâwhat is the process for checking that? There are many examples, and I am sure that the minister is aware of the potential for these things to exist. How do you actually check the volition of the claim as to whether or not all of the diesel is eligible? An example could be that the employees of a forest harvesting contractor could all have diesel vehiclesâmost of them doâand they could all fill up out of the contractor's diesel tank in the bush, and that diesel would not really be eligible for the scheme but you have the person claiming it. I am not sure that you can actually verify this and I think that, unless you have some process in place, you 
 are not going to be able to verify it. I will quote what Mr Colmer from the tax office actually said about that:</para><para>To some extent that is something that is going to develop as the scheme unfolds because we do not have detailed experience at the moment with this scheme. This is a new scheme that is starting next year. We are trying to get in place a balance of requirements so that people can undertake their business and we can actually monitor the arrangements.</para><para>It is the monitoring of arrangements that I would like to know about, because you do not have any records at the moment other than the diesel rebate scheme records. They are the only records, I would suggest, that the tax office has for you to be able to check as to whether or not, when this new scheme starts, people are actually making larger claims for diesel which they are using for other purposes. What is to stop a company or a person buying diesel for others?</para><para>Those are the sorts of things which were experienced with the early diesel fuel rebate scheme, and I would like to know exactly how you intend to monitor them. This is only a two-year program. I cannot accept the tax office saying, `It will develop as the scheme unfolds,' because you are essentially going to have two financial years. I would have thought you would have been a little bit further down the track with regard to a detailed proposal of what types of checks and balances you intend to have in place to ensure that the 16c a litre that is going to be paid through the scheme is actually paid for what it is intended.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>11166</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is not really a lot more to add. I realise the Labor Party have a range of views on these things, and I guess the challenge for the leadership of the Labor Party is to try to pull them together. Senator Conroy seems to think that this verification regime is far too strict and is going to impose too much on truck drivers. He would like to roll it back so it would be a slack sort of scheme that could easily be rorted. Senator Murphy is saying, I think, that it is maybe not tight enough, and 
 Senator Hutchins on Tuesday had his own concerns about whether trucks could be pulled over. There is a whole range of different views on the scheme. I guess the big challenge for those opposite is to come up with an alternative taxation system that will raise the revenue, that will be fair to people, and that will be efficient. We have sought to do that and this is obviously part of the arrangement.</para></talk.start><para>What the honourable senator opposite quoted was an extract from the committee <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I presume, where the tax officer said, `It is a new scheme and we are going to develop it.' I think what was said in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, and I am sure it was quoted accurately, was a very wise and sensible contribution to the debate. It would of course be absurd for a tax officer giving evidence to a Senate committee to say, `These are all the rules, it is all ready to go, and there is no more development of the program to take place.' The tax office, as I said on numerous occasions last Tuesday and now today, have experience in these self-assessment systems.</para><para>This is, as the tax officer before the inquiry said, a new system, but it is based on self-assessment. There is a range of powers available to the tax office. I refer the honourable senator to page 13 of the explanatory memorandum which, at 2.3, talks about part 4, which contains the rules about record keeping and substantiation. It refers to the fact that the commissioner can, for five years after a claim is made, go back and audit it. If someone seeks a grant, buys the diesel and then gives it to someone elseâin other words they rort the systemâthat would be a fraud and against the Crimes Act. There would be quite serious penalties, the smallest of which would probably be to ensure that they are not eligible for any future grants. There is a whole range of methods. The tax office will verify that it is for business purposes, and any business records may be examined for that purpose. So if there is rorting and fraud going on, the chances are that, at some time, the tax office will find it and the person who is rorting will be charged with fraud.</para><para>Senator Murphy may have a suggestion as to how he thinks we could improve the measures to reduce the chances of rorting and 
 to improve the chances of people getting caught, so I welcome him back to the debate. At the moment all we have had is a series of Labor senators coming up with a range of different views. Some seem to want to make the system slacker and easier to rortâthat is the Conroy faction. I have not figured out where Senator Hutchins is coming from. He has asked a series of questions about how trucks can be pulled over to the side of the road. I do not know whether Senator Hutchins thinks it is a good thing that a truck can be pulled over to see if they are rorting a grants scheme or whether he thinks you should just let them go on rorting. He may be just trying to get across the regime, which I informed the Senate last Tuesday is very similar to the fuel substitution regime in terms of the powers available to the commissioner. I do refer the senator to page 13 of the explanatory memorandum, which sets it out very clearly. There is nothing I can add to that, quite frankly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>11167</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor the minister's benefit and to clarify our position, Senator Conroy is saying that you really cannot verify this process without making it so restrictive and without having the record keeping so tough and onerous that it is hardly worth the trouble. It will be a cost to truck operators in particular. But that is not the question I am asking.</para></talk.start><para>I might make this suggestion with regard to off-road agricultural, mining and/or forestry diesel, which is currently already eligible for the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Maybe it would have been a worthwhile exercise to make some assessment of the current fuel volumes used so that you would know whether or not there is a rort in the process further down the two-year track. That may have some application. This is a new scheme, and what has not been explained is where somebody puts in a claim and then uses the diesel for other purposes. The tax officer said this is going to develop as the scheme unfolds. This is the tax office that came before this committeeâthe tax office that you say has all this experience with regard to self-assessment programs.</para><para>I would have thought that they would have at least been able to come before the committee and say, `Senator, these are the things we 
 have in mind in terms of checks and balances' and not `This is a new scheme,' because that contradicts the minister's proposition to the Senate that the tax office have all of the experience. It was the tax office that came before the committee. If they have all the experience, why could they not have explained some of that experience to us in respect of this scheme?</para><para>I am not saying that you should make the record keeping tougher; I am saying that there ought to be some thought given to ensure that the scheme is not rorted. As I put to the minister before, the tax office already has a problem with self-assessment schemes. That has been publicly acknowledged by the Commissioner for Taxation. I would really like to know if they are going to work it out as it goes along. It has two financial years of running. Sure, the tax commissioner might be able to go back five years, but in this case he will only be able to go back two because that is the extent of its operation. How is he going to do all that? How are you going to run this and ensure that the diesel that is eligible for the 16c a litre is being used for the intended grant purpose?

I can well appreciate his questioning on that aspect of the Job Network announcement made by the government last week. One of the best things any government can do for the people of Australia is to provide them with real jobs. Providing those jobs should be number one priority and it has been with the Howard government. Our improving economy Australia wide has meant an improvement in job prospects. From the tragic figures of the Labor yearsâdouble digit unemployment of 10, 11 and 12 per centâthe unemployment rates in Australia at the present time are down to around seven per cent. The announcement by my colleague Mr Abbott of new Job Network sites will certainly help job seekers in Australia, particularly in regional Australia, meet up with employers who have employment and are seeking workers for that employment.</para></talk.start><para>The Job Network sites, as announced last week, will increase Australia wide from some 1,400 at the present time up by 50 per cent to some 2,100. In regional Australia, where unemployment regrettably is a fraction higher than it is in metropolitan Australia, the number of Job Network sites actually doubles from 600 sites to 1,150 sites. More than 300 new Job Network sites, including outreach sites, will be established in towns in regional Australia which currently do not have a Job Network presence. These include places like Gilgandra and Bellingen in New South Wales, Daylesford and Nagambie in Victoria, Charleville, Mossman and Barcaldine in Queensland, Karratha and Halls Creek in Western Australia, Docker River in the Northern Territory and Coober Pedy in South Australia.</para><para>I am pleased that Michael Raper from the Australian Council of Social Service has said about our announcement to increase the number of sites that `having more of them, having them closer, having them more local is a big help to unemployed people'. He went on to say that this will mean less travel and 
 less cost for people who want access to employment services.</para><para>Madam President, in Job Network 2, which will be a performance driven system for the delivery of employment services in rural and regional Australia, a number of agencies are increasing their involvement in job placement. They include Mission Employment and also the Salvation Army's Employment Plus agency. They will both be recruiting staff in the next three months. Thanks to the big expansion of sites, I am advised that there could be an additional 500 jobs in the Job Network itself.</para><para>This good news in helping with a decrease in unemployment and with employment opportunities, particularly in regional Australia, is in stark contrast to the Labor Party's approach.

Senator, let me make a general comment on charities before I get to the specifics of your question. Under Labor's wholesale sales tax system 
 charities pay embedded sales taxes on their charitable activities. The Labor Party wishes to keep this. We want to lift that burden. Under Labor's tax system, charities pay full excise on their petrol. Under the coalition, the price of petrol will fall for charities. I am just going through the impact on charities under Labor's proposed system.</para></talk.start><para>Under Labor's system some families are in such bad poverty traps that they face effective marginal tax rates of 100 per cent. We have made some very important changes in this direction. Under our system there is a real increase in pensions and benefits and very substantial cuts in taxation for families. We are putting in place a major tax reform package which will benefit charities and which will benefit the clients of charities. The Labor Party policy is to do absolutely nothing.</para><para>The issue of fundraising through sponsorships was raised. Fundraising through sponsorships will be largely unaffected by GST, as the extra cost of the business sponsor will be offset by any input tax credit that it can claim.

That is always the problem when a prepared supplementary is available. You do not listen. I said fundraising through sponsorships from business will be largely unaffected by the GST, as the extra cost of 
 the sponsor will be offset by any input tax credit it can claim. Then I said that, in the case where you cannot claim an input tax credit, the sponsorship with the charity should not be affected because it is in the same position as any other sponsorship that the organisation may deliver. This tax system will provide very substantial real benefits to the clients of charities. It will provide benefits to charities. This government is not mean-spirited.

I am grateful to Senator McGauran for following this issue with such interest. The youth allowance payment was introduced on 1 July 1998 following extensive consultation with the community. It replaced five payment types for young people, all of which had different payment rates and different eligibility requirements. The main payment replaced was the previous Austudy, which had a number of structural disincentives for young people to choose study or training over the dole. Under Labor's system it was okay for young people to choose the dole. Actually, they made it easier for young people to do so. I wonder how Labor reconciles this policy stance with its supposed support of a more knowledgeable Australian society.</para></talk.start><para>Youth allowance has rebuilt from the ground up the income support system. Young people now can see to it that taxpayers' funds are targeted to those who are most in need. Youth allowance has provided incentives to stay in education or training until the age of 18. Let me remind all senators that Labor opposed the introduction of youth allowance. 
 Let it be very clear: the ALP opposed the introduction of youth allowance. Presumably they wanted to maintain a system where it was financially more advantageous to stay on the dole than to acquire skills. The reform of income support arrangements for young people and the introduction of the youth allowance represented an additional outlay of taxpayer funds for young people. An additional $254 million has been allocated to the payment over its first four years. That is something Labor should acknowledge, rather than trying to wage a misleading campaign in the community on behalf of the union movement.</para><para>The figures that have been released as part of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook show that the number of youth allowance customers at 5 November included 310,908 students. That is an increase of seven per cent over the same time last year. The average number of full-time students in 1998-99 was 273,126 and the projected average for 1999-2000 is 312,425. The growth in the number of students receiving youth allowance dispels the myths perpetuated by Labor that fewer people are continuing with their studies. It suits them to perpetuate those myths. Not only are more people staying and completing high school; the number of students between the ages of 21 and 24 receiving youth allowance has increased 10 per cent.</para><para>Clearly, as a policy, youth allowance is already proving to be an outstanding success. More people are completing school and more lower income people are undertaking tertiary education. More lower income people are taking on tertiary education. People with education and skills, as we all know, have a clear advantage in the job market. I would have thought the ALP would care about them. As I said in my speech to the National Press Club in September, the youth allowance represents an excellent example of welfare reform.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âA great speech, too!

In response to Senator Harradine's question, I would point 
 out that all lower to middle income families will be unaffected by the temporary Defence-East Timor levy. The levy applies only to the 2000-01 income year. Single income families with dependent children and income of up to around $100,000 will receive greater benefits from the new tax system than dual income couples on similar income. For example, after the impact of the levy, a single income family earning $70,000 will still receive around an extra $59 per week, a very substantial net benefit. This is because single income families also benefit significantly from the government's families package, which provides greater choice to families. Around 97 per cent of single income families earn less than $100,000.</para></talk.start><para>The levy, I think, has been welcomed by all sides of parliament. There is a recognition that there was a need for a temporary levy. In considering the options, the government always wishes to do things in a fair and equitable fashion, and we believe, all things considered, with this levy and the way we have arranged it, it is fair and equitable, particularly when you take account of the very substantial tax cuts that this government will be providing to families, and in particular to single income families.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11175</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

For these states this will ensure ongoing annual increases in funding each year. The government will also commit $1 million to help address aged care work force issues by, for example, promoting the aged care nursing work force, assisting with the retention of the existing work force and assisting to attract new entrants to that work force.

Commonwealth payments for residential aged care beds have increased from an average of $18,135 per bed in 1995-96âwhen Labor was last in government, I might sayâto $23,648 per bed in 1999-2000.

So there we are. Senator, we are always happy to help and in particular we are always happy to help you, because I know that was a genuine 
 question. The truth of the matter is that what this government is proposing for the car industry is cutting taxes on cars, which is good for the industry. The logic of the Labor Party position seems to be that if you increase taxes on cars that is good for the industry. The problem with that position is that no-one in the car industry would believe you. As I said earlier on in question time, no-one is calling for the reimposition of the wholesale sales tax on cars after 1 July next year. Everyone wants that system to go, particularly the car industry, because the car industry can see that in the medium and long term they are big winners under the new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>11179</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

What this does is ensure that, where you cannot get commercial services, you are able, in conjunction with local communities who make the identificationâand, of course, Labor never understands thisâto have at arms-length decision making by that board. If we are talking about sensible policy alternatives, let us see Labor introduce an arms-length project. It would be an absolute world first, because they do not believe in them. They believe in handing out things and asking you to be grateful. Senator Schacht wanted to keep that power of direction.

Mr Howard said on 25 September 1996, when the Labor Party had been defeated, that `the pall of censorship on certain issues had been lifted'. He said to the Queensland Liberal division in August the same year that he would not have `excess intolerance of legitimate dissent and legitimate minority points of view'. The truth of Mr Howard in government is very different to those two statements. This government is simply a bunch of standover merchants when it comes to those who are in receipt of government grants. Speech is not free; it is shackled to funding. Intolerance of dissent is the guiding principle as far as this Howard government is concerned.</para><para>Look at the defunded organisations. There is the Australian Youth Policy Action Coalition, National Shelter, the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation and the Womens Electoral Lobby. There have been severe funding cutbacks to organisations like the ACF and the Wilderness Society. This 
 government even had a real go at the Girl Guides. All of those organisations, to a greater or lesser extent, had been critical of the Howard government. That is the common thread. It is a case of `cash for comment' as far as this government is concerned. You get the money, and you give the government a positive spin, or else. If you do not promote the government, you do not get funded. That is how this government operates, and it stands condemned.</para><para>Of course, the most recent example of this is in the area of the government's GST Start-up Assistance Office and the contract that the government has for charities. Look at the words contained in this contract:</para><para>The Organisationâ</para><para>Madam Deputy President, that is the charityâ</para><para>shall keep the Officeâ</para><para>that is, the GST Start-up Assistance Officeâ</para><para>informed in relation to all publicity activity to be conducted in connection with the Project.</para><para>That is the problem. There is also a demand that the GST Start-up Assistance Office have all media enquiries referred to them for `an appropriate response'. That is the way the Howard government does business. What it means is this: charities are effectively gagged on problems that they may experience with the GST. If they are not willing to be gagged, they will not get funded. Funding is tied to support for the government. So, with this government, the rule is: either you do the government's bidding or you do not get government funding. That is the clear message. I suppose it is the reversal of the old bushranger's cry of `stand and deliver'. It is now `stand and we may deliver'. That is the problem. It is using government money to buy an organisation's, in this case a charity, silence, and that is not good enough for any government. This government stands condemned for this extraordinary performance in ensuring that there is no free speech, no freedom of thought and no capacity for charitable organisations in this country to properly represent the views of those who they have genuine interests in.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>11183</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday has been probably one of

We have a situation where there has been an enormous amount of focus being placed upon the charities to make sure they are not worse off under the new tax system. The GST legislation already contains several concessional measures that are available to charities. They include things like a registration turnover threshold of $100,000, GST-free status on non-commercial activities, GST-free status on supplies of donated second-hand goods, GST-free status on raffles and bingo games and the ability to claim input tax credits, which will lower their operating costs.

And the ability to use the cash basis of accounting regardless of annual turnoverâthe Labor Party do not want that either. </para></talk.start></continue><para> So we have a situation today where the Labor Party, right through question time, advocated higher costs to run charities. They want more expensive motor vehicles. Let us face it: the Labor Party were the ones that continued to put sales tax up on motor vehicles. We are proposing to remove that sales tax and put a lower GST on motor vehicles. Plus, all the input taxes will go and all operating taxes will goâeverything is rebated. But, no, the Labor Party just want to wind it all back and make sure that there is a higher tax level on motor vehicles. And the same, as I say, applies to charities.</para><para>There is also the line that is being pushed about corporate donations, for example, to charities: that charities are going to be worse off because corporations will have to pay a GST on donations to charities, or that the corporations will in fact remove or deduct the amount of GST they have to pay so that they still give the same amount. How dishonest can that line be? The fact of the matter is that a corporation that makes the donation is doing it, obviously, for gain, and the GST is fully rebatable. But, no, the Labor Party do not want to tell the people that. They do not want to make sure that they can actually come on board with a fair tax system and an honest tax system. No, they have come in here today and talked endlessly about increases in tax when they know the reverse is so.</para><para> But it just does not seem to matter, and unfortunately there is so much ill-informed journalism around on this matter, based on the nonsense that has been talked about by the Labor Party, that is faithfully reported without an understanding of how the new tax system is going to work. That is not informing the people of Australia honestly. I think, quite frankly, the media has a far greater responsibility to report accurately what is going to happen, not just simply report the Labor line in terms of making sure that everything is so distorted. This whole claim about the treatment of charities and motor vehicles and everything else is simply wrong.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>11184</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â`Report accurately what is going to happen': those were the words of 
 Senator Knowles just a moment ago, and, coming from a Liberal senator, they are rich indeed. What the Liberal Party means by `report accurately what is going to happen' is telling the people of Australia what the Liberal Party wants them to believe. If you are a business or, particularly in this case, if you are a charity and you need some government assistance to implement the GST with all of its new costs and processes, the government insists it will censor what you say to the community about the GST. Otherwise forget the idea of getting any support to change your business processes in order to be in compliance with the new tax system.</para></talk.start><para>Charities in Australia are among the most altruistic of all organisations. They are run by individuals who have a high idealistic commitment and who make personal sacrifices in order to deliver the purposes of that charity. They run, in the jargon, `on the smell of an oily rag'. No-one makes a profit out of delivering charity in this country; every red cent they get basically goes to the beneficiaries of that charity. Then this government rocks along and says, `We'll impose a GST on this sector.' Which charities put their hands up and said, `We would like to have a GST'? In the Senate inquiry which was conducted into the GST, not one single charity supported the concept of a GST. All of them said it would make their costs higher, which means that they would have to attract more donations to give the same amount of money as they did in the past to the beneficiaries of their charities.</para><para>All of the charities said it would take them away from their core business of aiding the poor or those Australians in need of special services. Their business is to deliver, but they will become collectors for the tax office instead. All of them said this at great length. Some of the charities retained, voluntarily, professors of economics and lawyers who were prepared to give their services to make sure their testimony was accurate and that the economic effects were properly set down. They are entitled to be heard in this debate, because if the government wants to cut welfare there will be more beneficiaries in the voluntary charity sector than there are now.</para><para>We have a government that says, `We are going to impose a tax on youâa GST. This tax will mean complications in understanding how it works and complications in complying with it. We are going to provide some assistance'âinadequate assistance, I might sayâ`to help you understand that tax, to educate your members in that tax, and to meet some paltry expenses in compliance costs. The net effect will be that you will be worse off, but we are giving this money so we can say we are aiding you when we know, at the end of the tally sheet, you are worse off.' And here is the rub: they say, `In order to accept any government funds, we will censor what you say.'</para><para>Here is what the government insists charities have to comply with in order to receive any funds:</para><para>The Commonwealth has the right to require prior approval by the Office of the content of all advertising material or other material made available or produced for distribution . . . </para><para>That is, the government will censor what charities tell the Australian community, otherwise they will not get any government assistance. Further:</para><para>The Organisation shall favourably acknowledge the contribution of the Commonwealth to the Organisation in any correspondence, public announcement, advertising material . . . </para><para>Not only are charities to be censored but they are to sign up to an open-ended commitment to praise the government for taxing them higher. This is something worthy of a dictatorship in a Third World country. We know the charities of Australia oppose the GST; it is in the record of the Senate hearings. But they are to shut up, otherwise they do not get any public assistance to help them run their affairs more effectively.</para><para>This is an outrage, and any Australian who has any sympathy for the charitable sector and the work they do, at great sacrifice to themselves, should condemn this government for the actions it is now undertaking in order to impose a government censorship on what they can tell the community about their needs. If charities tell the truth, they will be penalised in terms of the assistance necessary to deliver their services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>11186</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYet again we find the Labor opposition bereft of any positive initiatives on their own behalf, and so they resort to the scaremongering that has become a feature of their contribution to debates in this place, particularly in this taking note of answers segment following question time.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to the move to a GSTâthe much needed move, I might sayâand the treatment of charities under the new tax system, it was made crystal clear in the government's original policy document that the non-commercial activities of charities would remain free of the GST but the commercial activities undertaken by any such bodies would be subject to a GST. That proposed distinction has not changed one iota since the tax policy was announced. Indeed, to ensure that that proposal was implemented fairly, after the last election the government established the Voss committee to look at the design of the GST, particularly the scope of non-commercial activities of charities that should be included within that GST-free provision.</para><para>The Voss committee recommended that a 50 per cent market value test definition for the non-commercial supply of goods should apply, and that recommendation of the Voss committee was incorporated in the legislation, along with the 50 per cent cost test. The commercial activities of charities need to be treated the same as the commercial activities of ordinary businesses. In other words, it is quite valid for the GST to be charged on the commercial activities of charities, because in that area they are competing with ordinary businesses, mostly small businesses. It is important that small business is not put at a disadvantage in relation to specifically identified commercial activities by competing with charities.</para><para>It is important that a distinction is drawn between the commercial activities of a charity and the non-commercial activities of a charity. The commercial activities, quite correctly and quite fairly, will be subject to a GST so that small businesses in the same field are not put at a disadvantage. The non-commercial 
 activities will certainly remain free of GST, as the government originally committed.</para><para>There are a number of other concessions that the government has made to charities. First, their registration turnover threshold is $100,000 per annum compared with $50,000 for ordinary businesses. We have already mentioned the GST-free status of non-commercial activities, but there will also be a GST-free status for suppliers of donated second-hand goods and a GST-free status for raffles and bingo activities. Charities will also retain the ability to claim input tax credits. That will lower the operating costs for charities. They will also have the ability to choose the cash basis of accounting, regardless of annual turnoverâagain, a significant concession made to charities that is not available to ordinary businesses.</para><para>Further assistance has been provided for charities in relation to the transition to the new tax system with the establishment of the GST charities consultative committee last August to provide information to the charitable sector on issues relating to the implementation of the goods and services tax and also to monitor the potential impact of the GST on sheltered workshops and neighbourhood centres and to develop rulings following identification of significant issues from the sector.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThey'll all praise you for that!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>âAnd we hear the Labor Party interjecting again. We know very well that a feature of their 13 years in government was a complete absence of any consultation. They initiated policies and introduced them overnight without any consultation whatsoever with affected businesses or affected sections of the committee. That is a complete contrast to the way in which this government operates across a whole range of policy initiatives which we have taken where consultation is an important part of the implementation process. That has been applied in this situation. Since August, the consultative committee in relation to charities and the GST has met six times and has been able to provide a great deal of clarification and guidance on GST issues relating to the charitable 
 sector. There has also been flexible registration criteria initiated. So there are a number of positive initiatives for charities. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>11187</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have just heard the government's defence; that is, if you are consulted about being destroyed, then you should feel happy about it. It ought to be pointed out yet again that charities happen to service the poorest, the most vulnerable and the weakest members of our community. And what does this government do? It attacks them for it. It seeks to impose upon them further disadvantages and further abuses in such a way as to obscure the truth from the Australian people as to the government's real intentions. It tries to tell small business, `We're trying to help you out. We are trying to prevent unfair competition from charities.' We have an old expression in this country that there is nothing quite as cold as charity, but from this government we have, quite clearly, blizzards being imposed upon this industry.</para></talk.start><para>The government says, `We are going to withdraw support from the people in our community who are most disadvantaged. We are going to cut back on the level of support that is provided through our education system, through our housing system and through our social security system and we are also going to disadvantage those organisations which we call upon to fill the gap being left by our neglect.' What needs to be asked about these particular guidelines which impose upon charities in return for receipt of moneys from the government an obligation that they will report favourably upon the Commonwealth government is: why is the Australian Taxation Office getting involved in this sort of behaviour? What sort of role is it that the Taxation Office is now filling under this government? Why is the Taxation Office becoming the policeman for this government in regard to its propaganda efforts? Why is the Taxation Office now allowing itself to be used as a mouthpiece for the government in regard to a high controversial policy position which seeks to seriously disadvantage organisations in this country that are seeking to help Aus 
 tralians who are so disadvantaged to begin with?</para><para>Quite clearly, this is an outrageous policy. That is an expression that is often used in this parliament, but I do not believe there could be any other description for a policy that asserts:</para><para>The organisation shall favourably acknowledge the contribution of the Commonwealth to the organisation in any correspondence, public announcement, advertising material . . .</para><para>Organisations are required to enter into a contract with this government to praise this government in return for the miserable amounts of money that are being paid to them to compensate for what was government policy to begin with. We have heard this Prime Minister talk at length about the need for more philanthropy in this country, but what we see from this government is a policy which actually seeks to discourage people from philanthropy.</para><para>This government is seeking to disadvantage people who are trying to help. There is, quite clearly, a pattern emergingâa cynical authoritarian obsession with thought control. There is an unmistakable pattern emerging whereby those critics who seek to question or challenge this government are asked to go without. In February this year the universities were told that they would get money only if they agreed to support the government on voluntary student unionism. In August this year various welfare groups were told that they were no longer to receive government support because they had not done enough to support the government. We saw the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition in September of this year lose money as a result of what the government thought were its critical attitudes. We have seen women's groupsâfor instance, the National Council for Single Mothers and their Childrenâlose money. Green groups have lost money as a result of what the government perceives to be their critical actions. We have seen Aboriginal groups, housing groups, pensioners and even the Girl Guides lose money.</para><para>This government has an obsession with making sure that, if you receive money from the governmentâyour rightful entitlement for generations in this countryâyour funding 
 basis will be threatened unless you praise this government. We have noticed a pattern emerging where the government seeks to impose an authoritarian view about the nature of public debate in this country. As far as this government is concerned, if you are in receipt of public funds you are under an obligation to praise the government. This is a totalitarian attitude. It is an attitude that ought be condemned by all parties in this Senate. I trust that the Prime Minister's so-called new coalition of practical and tangible benefits is understood to be what it is, and that it is understood that this government is heavily influenced by such an ideology. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor: Refugees</title><page.no>11188</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11188</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today, relating to East Timorese refugees.</para><para>East Timorese safe haven visa holders have been in the news recently, particularly some of those from the Leeuwin base in Perth. The issue from the Democrats' point of view highlights one of the major dangers with the safe haven visa. The legislation implementing safe haven visas passed through this chamber at very short notice earlier this year in response to the government's approach to how to deal with the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. That was done at short notice and some of the potential problems with it were highlighted at the time by the Democrats and others. This situation with the East Timorese brings to the fore exactly what the problems are with the safe haven visas. They are purely temporary, but more importantly they are completely and utterly at the discretion of the minister as to whether or not people can have their visa extended.</para><para>People who have a safe haven visa are not able to apply for any other form of visa while they are here. They are not able to apply for a refugee or protection visa or a family reunion visa. They have to leave the country before they can apply for anything, unless the 
 minister lifts the bar and exercises his discretion.</para><para>In question time, we had Senator Vanstone saying that we should trust the minister, that he is a humanitarian type of guy, and that if people have any real concerns or genuine reasons, to use the minister's terminology, then Minister Ruddock will look at it. That is all very good. The problem is that under the safe haven visa legislation the minister is not even required to look at it, let alone to agree to it. There is no way of compelling him to even bother opening the mail and reading people's requests to be able to stay longer. There is certainly no way of being able to appeal against his decision, if he makes one, not to grant that. As we learnt at estimates last week, indeed there are no guidelines in place for the minister to use or to measure any requests against. So we have a situation where there are no guidelines, no criteria and no way of forcing the minister to examine a request for someone to be able to stay longer.</para><para>It is quite obvious to all Australians that the circumstances and the situation in Dili are not ideal and that people should have some opportunity to decide for themselves when they wish to return. We are just moving into the monsoon season. The shelter in many parts of the country and in Dili is clearly inadequate. People are being given a bag of rice to go back with. Many of those people would have no means for cooking the rice when they get home. It is clearly a ridiculous situation. I am baffled as to why the government is so keen and is going to such lengths to force people out. I think it is particularly inappropriate and disingenuous for the government to continue to insist that all returns are voluntary. We had that in question time and in estimates last week.</para><para>The department is emphasising that all returns are voluntarily. They even get to sign a form saying, `I am voluntarily leaving.' All you have to do is look at the television. Written and verbal statements have been issued by many of the East Timorese saying that they do not want to go back yet, that they would prefer to stay here. The government insists on trying to say that somehow or other nonetheless they are returning voluntarily. The fact is 
 that the decision as to whether or not people can stay or have to go lies not with the refugees themselves but solely with Minister Ruddock. Whilst we can all hope that he acts in a humanitarian way, the fact is that he and his agents through the government and the department are going to great lengths to encourage people to leave, running them up against a deadline of their visa which expires, I think, in two days time, with no surety that they would be able to stay, that any extension would be granted.</para><para>There is no way that any reasonable people could suggest that that was voluntary and, more importantly, no way that any reasonable person could suggest that such an approach is a humane one for people to whom we, as Australians, still owe a great debt. We all know the East Timorese people have endured an enormous amount of suffering. To enable them to stay in Australia at least until the monsoon season is over seems like the least we could do to further assist those who wish to stay in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The information related to the case of the person known as the Chinese woman. The grounds stated by Minister Ruddock for refusing such information were that:</para><para>.	 a separate inquiry had been established, and it was expected that this would be a thorough and detailed investigation; and</para><para>.	 the person undertaking the inquiry should not feel under any pressure to complete the task;</para><para>The Committee was concerned that the explanation seeks to avoid the obligation of departments to provide information on the basis that a Ministerial inquiry will have precedence. However there is no basis for such an approach, and it was noted that the absence of a reporting date for Mr Ayers' inquiry did not suggest that information would be available to the Committee in a reasonable time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, we believe, had even less reason for seeking to interfere in a Senate inquiry, used a similar argument. The terms of Mr Ayers inquiry related primarily to actions of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and its officers. This approach resulted in delay to the work of the Committee, with considerable time spent in discussions and correspondence. The Committee, after lengthy deliberation, took the decision to exercise its powers and ordered both 
 departments to appear before it. The Minister's reversed their decisions and officers of the departments appeared voluntarily at later hearings and the Committee was then provided with a substantial amount of information, including documents. The Committee is pleased at this outcome which avoided the need for referring the matter to the Senate and possibly to the Privileges Committee.</para><para>Confidential documents</para><para>A further burden to the Committee's work has been caused in part by the production of a substantial amount of material which departments have requested remain confidential. Such requests relate to personal and other information about the Chinese woman, and about Mr SE; to extensive correspondence including cables and other documents from departments; and to several other items including contracts between DIMA and a series of service providers in the Information Advice and Application Scheme (IAAAS).</para><para>On several occasions I have, on behalf of the Committee, sought advice from both departments about the status of this information. While I accept that material relating to a person's application for protection in Australia and to their medical status should generally remain confidentialâprimarily on the grounds of privacyâthere seems little benefit in placing much other information in a similar category.</para><para>At this time, although DFAT has provided an extensive list of documents that may be published, DIMA has cleared a limited number for publication. It has also not provided documents relating to contractual arrangements for services on the basis that these will only be provided if they are not published. It is necessary for departments to realise that, regardless of the decisions of Committee members, the Senate retains the power to order the publication of material; hence, it is not possible for the Committee itself to make any definitive order of the type requested by DIMA.</para><para>The claim of commercial in confidence is increasingly common in respect of material that is sought by Parliament. At this stage, the Committee has not pursued this issue. However, I note the matter as a reason for delays experienced in obtaining information to address the terms of reference of our inquiry.</para><para>The Committee notes that claims of confidentiality can often disrupt hearings and make it difficult to obtain information essential to an inquiry. While there will be many documents that should not be published for good reasonsâand this Committee accepts appropriate limitationsâbroad requests can hinder effective questioning and investigation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">New legislation</inline></para><para>A second reason for seeking an extension is the emergence of important new legislation governing 
 the legal framework for people seeking protection in Australia. On 23 November 1999, the government introduced into the Senate the <inline font-style="italic">Border Protection Bill 1999</inline> , which was passed two days later with bipartisan support.</para><para>Among other things the new law introduced:</para><para>.	 temporary visas for unauthorised arrivals found to be refugees;</para><para>.	 prevented access to Australia's refugee determination system for those with alternative protection avenues;</para><para>.	 and increased the powers to accurately identify asylum seekers.</para><para>The committee considered it important to devote time to evaluating the practical and policy implications of these new laws, and considerable time in public hearings was spent exploring these issues with departmental officials.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Need for Additional Hearings </inline></para><para>A further reason the Committee seeks an extension is the need for additional hearings and other briefings.</para><para>Between 5 July and 29 November 1999 the Committee held 15 public hearings and 9 in camera hearings. It plans another hearing tomorrow (7 December). Next week, the committee will be discussing issues with officers from the Attorney-General's department, and the committee expects to hold a further hearing in Western Australia early in 2000.</para><para>The Committee needs additional time in which to consider this evidence.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Other Factors </inline></para><para>First report</para><para>The Committee had planned to present a first report to the Senate before the end of this current sitting session. A considerable amount of the work has been done in the preparation of chapters relating to some of the Inquiry's terms of reference. However, during deliberation on these drafts, the Committee found that it was difficult to separate and compartmentalise each term of reference. Reluctantly, the Committee decided to abandon the idea of reporting separately on some terms of reference in order that the report should be complete and comprehensive when it is tendered to the Senate.</para><para>Issues not within terms of reference</para><para>I should also note that a further difficulty which the Committee has experienced has been the belief that the inquiry concerns a range of issues relating to immigration detention centres, such as treatment of detainees and the legality of detention itself. Members have sought to explain to individuals and organisations that there is no specific term of reference that examines the issue of detention centres, but this has not always been accepted. 
 Other concernsâabout removal from Australia, about the conduct of a case before the RRTâhave also been expressed. The Committee has advised that it is not in a position to investigate individual cases, with the exception of the two referred in the terms of reference. Again, this has not always been understood or accepted by members of the community.</para><para>These matters have also added significantly to the Committee's work, requiring both discussion and correspondence.</para><para>Allegations of intimidation/assault of witnesses</para><para>The Committee has also received reports during the course of the inquiry about assault and intimidation of witnesses and of other persons. The Committee took action on these matters for two reasons. Firstly, allegations of assault against detainees who themselves may have limited access to other sources of assistance, must necessarily be reported to the appropriate authorities in the same way as any such allegation would be reported by a citizen.</para><para>Secondly, the Committee emphasises that intimidation or assault of a witness in respect of evidence given or believed to have been given to the Committee is prohibited under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, the principles of which are set out in the Standing and Other Orders of the Senate.</para><para>The Committee has been obliged to consider matters in both categories. This has further delayed its consideration of evidence, but it believes that such action is essential in order to maintain the rights of witnesses and of Committees of the Parliament.</para><para>For the above reasons, I would ask that the Senate agree to the request for an extension of time to report.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Withdrawal</title><page.no>11191</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11191</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Coonan, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in the name of Senator Coonan for seven sitting days after today for the disallowance of Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 202 and made under the Customs Act 1901.

However, the Committee considers it might be regarded as unreasonable to expect a similar level of knowledge about EPO of any person who has come to Australia for purposes relating to a competitor's interests.</para><para>The Committee would be grateful for your advice on this matter.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Helen Coonan</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chair</inline></para><para>24 November 1999</para><para>Senator Helen Coonan</para><para>Chair</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator Coonan,</para><para>Thank you for your letter of 14 October 1999 and for conveying concerns of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances about the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation on Erythropoietin (EPO).</para><para>The intent of the Regulation is twofold. Firstly, it is to enable legitimate users of EPO to retain their medication on arrival to Australia. The role of Customs staff in enforcing the restriction involves satisfying themselves that any arriving international 
 traveller with EPO has a legitimate authority to possess it. This concession is designed as a "last minute" safeguard for those in need of the medication but who might not reasonably be expected to know of Australian requirements for the importation of EPO. The simple act of showing a routine prescription from a registered medical practitioner satisfies that test, for all travellers except the group mentioned below.</para><para>Secondly, the Regulation quite deliberately ensures that a competitor or those very closely associated with them may only import EPO on their arrival to Australia with the express permission of the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). That is, any athlete or their associates who have a genuine requirement for EPO is not denied access to and can readily obtain a Permit from TGA.</para><para>This latter mechanism was designed specifically to maintain the integrity of the Regulation, and only after exhaustive consultation with TGA, the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) and the Australian Sports Commission (ASC). Besides ensuring bona fide cases can import EPO, the Regulation will ensure that in Australia the appropriate sports agencies know that any competing athlete or someone associated with them, has access to EPO. It would then be up to the sports agencies to address any concerns they have in terms of doping risk or contraventions of doping policies.</para><para>The mechanism covers wider than simply the competitor because it is expected that persons such as the athlete's coach, or manager or doctor are as knowledgeable about doping in sport as the athlete. In particular that they are aware of the growing international concern about EPO being used as a banned substance because of its performance enhancing properties. Having recently chaired a two and half day International Drugs in Sport Summit, I can assure you that this is far from being an unreasonable expectation. The whole sporting community is acutely aware of the need for regulation of these matters. Knowledge is not limited to athletes.</para><para>Any athlete or those associated with them who do seek permission from TGA should have informed their own national sports administration of their legitimate medical need for EPO, thus adding a further level of accountability and transparency to the process. The Regulation therefore covers more than just the athlete to avoid a loophole that would allow the coach or manager to carry the EPO instead. Room for such an allegation would make a mockery of the Government's intention to restrict the importation of EPO for performance enhancement purposes in sport.</para><para>Any athlete, coach or manager carrying medication (including EPO) without permission is an indicator of a likely improper use of the substance, which can then be investigated. This is little different 
 from other performance enhancing substances which currently require written permission from TGA for anyone to import them into Australia.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, this Regulation was prepared in close consultation with ASDA and ASC. The doping in sport controversy, particularly leading up to the Olympics, cannot be ignored and Customs sought advice from sports as well as health experts. This Regulation is not onerous for anyone closely involved with elite and/or international sport. EPO is not a drug of normal use or availability. I am advised anyone in legitimate need of EPO is seriously ill. The Regulation provides a simple framework for those in need to easily and readily comply with a minimum of fuss or worry whilst not providing access to EPO by sports cheats.</para><para>I trust this assists the Committee in its deliberations.</para><para>Should the Committee require further elaboration of the reasons for these Regulations I would be very happy to appear before the Committee with Customs officials to answer any questions that the Committee may have.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>(signed)</para><para>AMANDA VANSTONE</para><para>25 November 1999</para><para>Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone</para><para>Minister for Justice and Customs</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA   ACT   2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>At its meeting today, the Committee noted your reply of 24 November 1999 on the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.3), Statutory Rules 1999 No.202 and welcomed the information provided on its concerns.</para><para>The Committee has continuing concerns with aspects of the instrument, including the following;</para><para>The appropriateness of drawing a distinction between legitimate users and competitors or those very closely associated with them;</para><para>The meaning of `a person who has come to Australia for purposes relating to the performance of a competitor or the management of a competitor or a competitor's interests';</para><para>Processes associated with obtaining permission to import EPO; and</para><para>Clarification of an `authorised officer' and in particular who issues a permission to import.</para><para>The Committee therefore wishes to accept your invitation to meet with it and if you agree with this

Laws which protect the integrity of Australia's border should provide a strong disincentive to the unauthorised importation of weapons and other dangerous goods.

It is an issue that relates to planning and the arrangements around how we plan for events and developments in the Australian Capital Territory. Planning has a long history, and a very proud and contentious one in many respects, in the ACT. Particularly since the advent of self-government, the management of planning in Canberra has been subject to an ongoing debate. The establishment of the territory planning organisation and the retention of the National Capital Planning Authority, now the National Capital Authority, was designed to ensure that the preservation of Canberra's attributes as the national capital were acknowledged by the federal parliament and a mechanism retained to ensure that our both our status and, I suppose, our reputation and the aesthetics of this wonderful place were reflected via that National Capital Authority.</para></talk.start><para>The motion moved here today relates to the works approval for plans to host a V8 Supercar race here on what is termed desig 
 nated land in the vicinity of Parliament House. I would like to make some comments on the basis that the issue is of concern to many in the Canberra community. As such, I believe it is my responsibility to place on the record the processes that involved the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, a committee of which I, amongst others, am a member. I take a continuing and very detailed interest in planning issues and have a couple of things I would like to say.</para><para>First of all, I believe it is very important to appreciate the planning processes currently in place as far as the national capital committee is concerned. It performs an advisory role to the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. That committee was constructed to give the federal parliament the opportunity to comment on, and in some way participate in, the process of approving works in the parliamentary vicinity. That is exactly what we have done with respect to the V8 car race. A time line of decision making was adhered to. Despite the assertions of many in the Canberra community, that committee has done its utmost to draw to the attention of both the federal government and the ACT government issues of concern. Those issues are numerous. That committee prepared correspondence for the minister arising out of its deliberations.</para><para>The time line is this: on 31 August, the ACT Assembly effectively approved the proposal to establish the V8 car race here in the ACT. There was a lengthy debate. Those in opposition in the ACT and on the crossbench, as is their right, reserved their right to continue to call the ACT government to account on this proposal. Subsequently, on 8 September, the proposal was brought before the Joint Standing  Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. As a member of that committee, I had the opportunity to peruse at some length the proposal presented to us by the National Capital Authority.</para><para>The committee offered its support in a qualified way. That qualification was expressed in a comprehensive letter to the minister. It traversed some areas of concern, including 
 occupational health and safety issues, issues of crowd management, issues of retaining aesthetics in the parliamentary triangle area and issues of concern relating to local residents, who had expressed at that point in the public debate concern about noise and so forth.</para><para>On 22 September, an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in which Jacqui Rees expressed the view that the parliament had not been brought into the loop at that time, even when we had by virtue of this briefing to the joint standing committee. On 8 October, the ACT government launched the plans for the proposal on the basis that they had secured a pathway of process up to that point that allowed them to develop the proposal to a greater extent and have the ACT named as the preferred site for the event.</para><para>On 13 October, another letter appeared claiming that some dubiousness relating to process had taken place. At that stage, I believe that some legitimate concern had been expressed about process. I will comment on that shortly. On 19 November, the National Capital Authority received the works approval application in relation to the project. The ACT government had nominated the 22nd to put tickets on sale for the event. On 30 November, the issue was listed here in the federal parliament.</para><para>The point is this: through all that process, there has been ample opportunity for people to express their concerns through their political representatives on the joint standing committee and subsequently. It was not until a late stage of the debate that the actual notion of using this parliamentary process as some form of planning veto was actually nominated by some activists. I believe that is cause for concern.</para><para>I value the use of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital as a mechanism for parliamentary scrutiny and deliberation on planning issues. I also respect the need for those in the ACT, regardless of their political persuasion, to tell people who are proposing ideas that they have a planning process and what that process is. I am gravely concerned about the introduction and use of the national capital committee and this subse 
 quent presentation before parliament as some last-minute veto. I will always reserve the right as a representative of the ACT to express the view of my community through that process. However, the time for expressing that view and allowing those factors to be considered as part of the debate within that committee is effectively long gone.</para><para>However, planning is always contentious. That is the legacy we have as a result of the Carnell government in the ACT. That legacy is not a proud one. It is not one that the ACT community has a great deal of confidence in. I empathise greatly with those in our community who do have consistent concerns, regardless of the subjective merit of any planning proposal, because of this history. I do not need to remind too many people in the community who are concerned about the V8 car race about the Futsal slab debacle, which identified some flaws in the process of approval. It led to the committee I am onâthe joint standing committeeâexpressing grave dissatisfaction about the process by which the parliament and that committee's approval processes were used for that project.</para><para>In conclusion, I will raise another issue related to this. There is a reasonable call that again the ACT government has been a little insensitive in its management of this and a little disrespectful of the processes within the federal parliament. It relates to putting those tickets on sale before the works approval was given. I understand the need for having an identifiable way in which the Assembly can proceed in putting ideas into action. I will always respect its right to deliberate the relative merits of those proposals. However, given the circumstances and given that so many people in Canberra care very passionately about the nature and precinct of particularly the parliamentary surrounds, any proposal of this nature requires the utmost sensitivity, attention and commitment to due diligence.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âSenator Lundy, you were given leave to make a short statement.

They fall into three parts. Firstly, there is due process. Notwithstanding what Senator Lundy said in cataloguing what she saw as the administrative process that has led us to be where we are at the moment, the fact remains that we are still very much putting the cart before the horse. It should not have to be the case that we find ourselves here today snookered, as it were, into being forced to make a decision on something which appears to have been set up as a fait accompli. I understand the promoter of the 
 event was on radio this morning saying that the Senate was just here this afternoon to rubber-stamp the process, and I am offended by that. There must be a better way of going about doing these things. I think the parliament really has the right to know exactly what is being planned before these things are presented as such. Our second concern relates to noise pollution, and I am not convinced that that has been adequately addressed in terms of the noise expected on the day and the way in which it will drift over residential surrounds.</para></talk.start><para>Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, is the notion of the post-race behaviourâthat is, the driver education programs which have been implemented in some other places. There is anecdotal and empirical evidence to show that general driving, particularly amongst young men, is prone to become dramatically worse post these events. These events in a metaphorical way fire up the blood with some people and bring about unacceptable behaviour in terms of driving in the streets and surrounds of the area. There is clearly no plan of action by the ACT government in terms of addressing that scenario should it present itself, and indications are that it would. It is very clear here this afternoon that, given that both the government and the opposition are in agreement, there is little point in going to a division, but I want to express the deep concerns of the Democrats with the process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>11201</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Regional Services, Territories and Local Government</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI simply want to thank the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for their understanding of this application, and also the local representatives of Canberra, Senator Lundy, Senator Reid and others. I also thank the National Capital Authority for the way they have dealt with the application.</para></talk.start><para>This is not an application from the federal government; it is from the promoters and Tourism-Canberra, the local tourism promotion organisation. The law, the Parliament Act 1974, quite clearly sets down the process which has been followed by the National Capital Authority and the government. All of 
 the documents were tabled in this Senate last Tuesday and are available for all senators to have a look at. There was very detailed information provided by the promoters and by the National Capital Authority. The ACT government is supportive of the proposal because of the economic activity it will create and the jobs that will be created for Canberrans as a result of the activity.</para><para>Contrary to what Senator Brown has said, apart from the administrative costs of the National Capital Authority, which are covered by application fees and the like, there is no Commonwealth taxpayers' money whatsoever involved in this. There is a $200,000 bond lodged by the applicant to ensure that the site is made good, and that is deemed and assessed to be sufficient for us to go in and do it if perchance the promoters do not.</para><para>I just want to emphasise that due process has been followed and that no Commonwealth taxpayers' money has been involved. One of the reasons why the National Capital Authority is supportive of the application is that one of the roles of the National Capital Authority is to promote the ACT as our national capital, the national capital of all Australians. With this race, for those that enjoy car racingâand I must confess to not being one of them, but I do understand that many Australians do like this form of racingâthere will be widespread coverage on television and elsewhere. It is an opportunity for many Australians to see some of the national icons. It is great publicity for Canberra and it does show to the people of Australia that Canberra, while it is a special city, while it is our national capital, while it is a bush capital, is also a capital of ordinary peopleâpeople who like to participate in all forms of sporting prowess. It was thought by the National Capital Authority and the ACT government, and they have convinced me, to be a great opportunity to do what we are required to do, and that is to promote this city as our national capital.</para><para>I conclude by again thanking the joint committee, who have been involved in this all the way through. They have been briefed, they have had discussions with the National Capital Authority and they have been kept fully informed, as have the local members of 
 parliament who did take an interest in this right from the start. They have made inquiries, they have assessed it and they have talked everyone through it, and I thank them for their part in the process.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âI would like my sole dissenting voice to be recorded.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11202</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee </title><page.no>11202</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>11202</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>11202</page.no><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPursuant to standing order 38, I present report No. 19 of 1999 of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline>  No. 19 of 1999, as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline>  at item 14, which were presented to the President on 1 December 1999.

The seminar was opened by the parliamentary secretary responsible for Australia's aid program, the Hon. Kathy Sullivan MP, and the panel of speakers on the day included representatives of Jubilee 2000 and several other non-government organisations. The seminar was balanced by the inclusion of academics and officers of government departments and was very well attended by members of the diplomatic corps, representatives of government and non-government organisations and other interested parties.</para><para>The debt of the world's poorest nations is an issue that all sides of politics have a great deal of concern about, a concern shared by many people in Australia and around the world. A petition of 385,000 signatures from Australians that was presented to members of parliament clearly demonstrates the depth of feeling in the community about the debt issue. The Australian petition formed a part of a global petition of some 17 million signatures, which was delivered to the June 1999 meeting of the G7 nations in Cologne.</para><para>The debate about development has evolved in recent years. Debt is one of the fundamental problems inhibiting growth in the poorest nations of the world. There is a belief that debt and a failure to develop are intrinsically linked: highly indebted nations are unable to attract investment, nor to invest in their own social capital because of the debt burden they carry.</para><para>In 1996 the World Bank and the IMF launched the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative to alleviate some of the debt of the poorest nations. Criticisms have focused on the initiative's strict qualifying criteria, the limited amount of debt forgiveness and the long compliance period that countries must adhere to before debt forgiveness is offered. In response to the continuing debt crisis and the perceived shortcomings of the HIPC Initiative, a broad coalition of interested parties began campaigning for greater debt 
 forgiveness for the poorest nations by the year 2000 on moral and ethical grounds. In June 1999 G7 leaders agreed on the Cologne Debt Initiative, which would relax some of the criteria for access to debt relief and, most importantly, substantially increase the amount of money offered for debt forgiveness.</para><para>Australia bears little responsibility for the indebtedness of other nations. We accept that the role that the Australian government can play in reducing the debt of developing countries is somewhat limited. The committee's report therefore focuses on the concrete objectives that Australia can pursue to reduce poverty in the world's poorest and in other developing nations. In our report, we recognised the need for a fine balance between the monetary cost of the Jubilee 2000 proposals for debt relief and the human cost of doing nothing and the debt crisis continuing. It is on this basis that the committee recommended the government's continued support for the HIPC Initiative.</para><para>Australia does not have a great deal of bilateral debt owed to it by other nations, and even less of that debt is not being serviced. This is largely a result of prudent decisions to offer development assistance in the form of grants, not loans. At the seminar the committee was told that these debts totalled less than $80 million. In the spirit of the HIPC Initiative, the committee recommended that Australia offer this bilateral debt to be considered as part of any future contributions to the revised HIPC Initiative, where those countries are permitted and agree to meet HIPC conditions.</para><para>Despite the IMF proposal to revalue some of its reserves of gold in order to pay for the HIPC Initiative, the initiative will not be fully funded. It is on the basis of this expected shortfall that the committee recommended that the Australian government give consideration to additional contributions towards the HIPC Initiative, in line with Australia's levels of obligation to the IMF and the World Bank.</para><para>We also recommended that the Australian government give consideration to increasing substantially the current levels of Australian official development assistance. This recommendation is consistent with the government 
 continuing to endorse a ratio of 0.7 per cent of GNP to be spent on development assistance. During the seminar we also heard of the problems with putting any conditions on granting debt forgiveness. It was made clear to us that the problem is a serious one, and the committee recommended that the government negotiate a form of conditionality which will prevent the expenditure of these funds on military equipment or corrupt practices.</para><para>Debt relief may be a circuit-breaker but it is not a panacea for the development of the world's poorest countries. Development will flow only from a genuine commitment to improving the material conditions of people, along with basic policies and robust institutions that are essential to growth. In conclusion, may I commend the work of Jonathan Bonnar from our committee in putting this seminar together and his efforts in formulating the report. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interests Committee</title><page.no>11204</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Register</title><page.no>11204</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>11204</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Denman and in accordance with the Senate resolution of 17 March 1994 about the declaration of senators' interests, I present a copy of the latest register of senators' interests, incorporating notifications of alterations of interests, lodged between 18 September 1999 and 3 December 1999.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>11204</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>11204</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>11204</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: <inline font-style="italic">No. 12 of 1999âStaff Colleges Collocation Project, Weston Creek, ACT</inline> ; and <inline font-style="italic">No. 13 of 1999âAnzac Hall Extension, Australian War Memorial, Canberra ACT.</inline>  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the reports.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the reports.

</para><para>On 2 and 30 September and 21 October, the Committee held further hearings at Parliament House, Canberra and took evidence from Defence officials and representatives of the Australian Heritage Commission.</para><para>The Committee noted the concerns of local residents that collocation of the Defence staff colleges in Canberra would require abandoning Queenscliff, with a modern military instructional facility, and developing a similar institution at another site. The Committee therefore sought to quantify the extent of these benefits and, between August and October, sought additional information from Defence to substantiate the decision to collocate the colleges in Canberra.</para><para>In its conclusions, the Committee has made reference to the future use of the Fort Queenscliff property when the Army college is collocated in Canberra and has stressed the necessity to preserve the heritage values of the property when ownership is transferred.</para><para>Whilst the Committee's inquiry on this reference was unusually protracted, it was felt necessary to conduct an exhaustive examination of the rationale and justification for the location decision.</para><para>The second report I have tabled concerns the construction of a new exhibition hall for the Australian War Memorial at Campbell. The importance of the site has been recognised since 1941, when the Australian War Memorial opened to commemorate the sacrifice made by Australian men and women, and those who served with them, who died in time of war.</para><para>Since that time, the Memorial has developed and maintained a collection of historic material, conducted research into all aspects of Australia's military conflicts and is involved in other activities such as the dawn service on ANZAC Day.</para><para>The Memorial complex has been extended several times since 1941, with the Public Works Committee recommending in 1992 the construction of a depository at Mitchell to house large relics of war.</para><para>Funding has now become available to enable the construction of a large exhibition space, to be known as ANZAC Hall, at the Campbell site.</para><para>ANZAC Hall will provide visitors to the Memorial the opportunity to view much of the Memorial's collection at the one site, including many of the large relics that have been housed at the Mitchell depository.</para><para>One such relic is the Japanese midget submarine that was recovered from Sydney Harbour, with the Lancaster Bomber `G for George' and other assorted tanks and artillery expected to be strikingly displayed in the modern exhibition space of ANZAC Hall. 
</para><para>It is proposed that ANZAC Hall be constructed on the existing carpark at the Campbell site, and be connected to the Aircraft Hall in the Memorial by way of a glass link at a mezzanine level.</para><para>The loss of the existing carpark will require the development of several new parking areas. The Committee is particularly concerned that adequate parking spaces are provided, including spaces for people with disabilities and for buses.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that 355 sealed carspaces (including 10 carspaces for people with disabilities) and the proposed additional bus parking spaces are available to visitors before the opening of ANZAC Hall.</para><para>The construction of such a large exhibition hall obviously entails a considerable expanse of roof. At the public hearing, the Committee extensively questioned the architect and representatives of the Memorial and the National Capital Authority about various aspects of the roof.</para><para>The Committee is satisfied that the nature of the design, being set behind the Memorial and sunk into the ground, minimises any visual impact the roof expanse may have when viewing the Memorial along ANZAC Parade or from places such as Parliament House.</para><para>The Committee is also satisfied that the proposed Colorbond roof meets the requirements of the brief. This is despite the fact that both the National Capital Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission have indicated that a better quality material, such as zinc or copper, would be more appropriate.</para><para>At an additional estimated cost of $2 million, the Committee does not believe that a zinc or copper roof represents value for money. However, in recognition of the concerns raised by those organisations, the Committee has recommended that the Australian War Memorial and the National Capital Authority resolve this issue prior to the commencement of work.</para><para>The Committee recognises that as many people as possible should be able to access a building of such national importance. The Committee notes the progress of the Memorial in this area over the last few years and supports the decision by the Memorial to engage a consultant to advise on issues relating to people with disabilities.</para><para>It is anticipated that, subject to Parliamentary approval, the construction of ANZAC Hall will be completed by 31 March 2001 and officially opened on ANZAC Day 2001.</para><para>The addition of ANZAC Hall to the Memorial complex can only enhance the experience of the visitor; it can only enhance the understanding of the individual sacrifices made in time of war.

In particular, the co-location project of the Defence Staff College was a difficult one for the Public Works Committee because we were much attracted to the former site at Queenscliff in Victoria, which I believe has great heritage values. The Victorian government is going to protect those values. I just hope that particular establishment goes to a good home. I was not sad to see that we are going to have a co-located staff college in Canberra but it was sad for all the committee to see the traditional former establishment at Queenscliff closed. And it was a sad moment for the residents, because they did rely very heavily on the establishment there providing employment and goodwill in the community. I just hope that whoever takes over Queenscliff has the same rapport with the community that the Army did.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Crime Authority Committee</title><page.no>11206</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>11206</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11206</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator George Campbell, I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <inline font-style="italic">Street legalâThe involvement of the National Crime Authority in controlled operations</inline> , together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of the committee's proceedings and submissions.

The report recommends wider powers for covert 
 investigations matched by a more independent approval and accountability system.</para><para>In controlled operations, police, agents or informants work undercover and become involved in illegal activity in order to investigate more serious criminality such as the drug trade. A recent report by the Queensland Crime Commission estimated that law enforcement recovers only about 1.3 per cent of the heroin available annually on the Queensland market. To be effective law enforcement needs to infiltrate the sophisticated organisations behind the drug trade and gather intelligence about how they operate. The same applies to criminal organisations involved in other kinds of organised crime.</para><para>Controlled operations legislation immunises law enforcement officers against the consequences of their unlawful actions and secures the admissibility of the evidence obtained. But it also imposes statutory limitations and appropriate accountability. Across Australia, however, legislation differs. Under the Commonwealth regime in Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914, the NCA is only covered in relation to controlled operations in the investigation of offences involving the importation of narcotics. NSW and SA also enacted controlled operations legislation but those schemes differ from the Commonwealth regime in a number of respects. Other jurisdictions, such as Queensland, have no legislation.</para><para>As the NCA operates on a national basis, it is severely hamstrung by the disparate arrangements between the States and Territories. The Committee urges the States and Territories to either introduce uniform legislation or to promote national uniformity to ensure the NCA's effectiveness in counteracting organised crime.</para><para>This report recommends expanding the scope of controlled operations to the range of offences that the NCA is able to investigate under the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The NCA could then conduct controlled operations in relation to other organised crime with legislative approval. In particular, the NCA should be able to conduct controlled deliveries of cash to follow the money trail to the core of a criminal enterprise.</para><para>Civil liberties groups claimed that the current internal approval process for controlled operations allows room for the inappropriate use of power. Law enforcement agencies argued that an external approval system would adversely affect operational efficiency. On balance, the Committee recommended a two-tiered approval process, requiring external approval for longer-term operations. The current arrangements for urgent approval should be retained for where, say, drugs arrive at the barrier.</para><para>In relation to accountability, the Committee was concerned that an appropriate balance should be 
 struck between transparency and operational necessity. The Committee decided that the regime implemented in New South Wales involving independent oversight by the Ombudsman, is the preferred option.</para><para>Other significant recommendations include:</para><para>.	 extending the period of the validity of certificates authorising controlled operations from one month to three months;</para><para>.	 adopting the strictly limited provision in the New South Wales model for retrospective approval of controlled operations where the unlawful conduct was engaged in solely for the purpose of preventing death or serious injury; and</para><para>.	 extending the immunity under the Act to innocent civilians who assist police. The situation of informants who assist police, however, is different. The current arrangements, where certain representations can be made on their behalf during the prosecution process or at the time of sentencing, are appropriate.</para><para>Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the officers of the secretariat: Mick McLean, the Committee Secretary; Yvonne Marsh, Inquiry Secretary, and Debbie McMahon, the Executive Assistant.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>11207</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis report, <inline font-style="italic">Street legal</inline> , by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is a significant step towards ensuring that our law enforcement agencies are more effectively equipped in fighting organised criminal activity, particularly relating to the drug trade. The focus of this report has been on the NCA's involvement in controlled operations, a process by which a law enforcement agency may become involved in an illegal activity to assist in securing a conviction.</para></talk.start><para>There was unanimous support from law enforcement agencies who appeared before the inquiry for the need to maintain the power to engage in controlled operations. In fact, it was argued that law enforcement cannot have a significant impact on organised crime unless it can become involved in criminal organisations from time to time. At an international level there is a high degree of acceptance of controlled operations to combat the increasing drug trade. In fact, a recent report published by the Queensland Crime Commission revealed that law enforcement recovers only about 1.3 per cent of the heroin available 
 annually on the Queensland market. That 1.3 per cent is a very small amount in relation to drugs in Queensland and it is very clear therefore that the ability to conduct more effective controlled operations is vital in undoing and destroying this insidious industry.</para><para>One of the major concerns raised during the course of the inquiry related to the perception that the NCA's controlled operations were narrowly defined in the existing legislation. The committee heard that such a narrow interpretation prevented the NCA from investigating other narcotics offences which do not involve importation. It also put the NCA at a significant disadvantage in their non-drug related work in general. The committee has therefore recommended that the range of offences in which a controlled operation can be used should be expanded. It has therefore been recommended by the committee that the corresponding immunity which is granted to covert operatives should also be clarified.</para><para>We as a committee were concerned that the NCA be able to conduct controlled deliveries of funds and, very importantly, follow the money trail as a crucial part of the fight against crime. In operations, such as short-term investigations, where urgent approval is required, the committee recommended that the current arrangements remain as they are. However, we have nominated the Inspector-General or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to perform the role of providing external approvals.</para><para>Concerns were also raised before the committee about the protection currently being offered to civilians who become engaged in controlled operations. It was argued before the committee that, if we are going to ask these operatives or civilians to participate in this type of very dangerous work, we should be able to provide them with adequate legal protection. These people should be protected. It would be quite unfair for civilians, directed by law enforcement to engage in a dangerous task, to subsequently find themselves forced to defend their actions and the legality of those actions in court.</para><para>The inquiry also found that, while the NCA is seeking to operate on a national basis, it is 
 unbelievably hamstrung and significantly disadvantaged by the confusing arrangements which differ in the states and territories. The committee has therefore called upon the states and territories to introduce uniform legislation so the NCA can work across all states and territories in a much more efficient way. It is clearly absurd that organised crime significantly benefits from this lack of uniformity across the states and territories. Let's face it: the crime agencies do not worry too much about the rules as far as the states go, but of course the agencies involved in enforcement must do so, and we need to make sure those rules are harmonised.</para><para>Because many controlled operations extend beyond one month, the committee has recommended extending to three months the time under which the NCA can obtain a new certificate to continue to undertake this work. This will further strengthen the NCA's use of controlled operations as a crime fighting tool. All Australians are worried about the increasing drug trade and its effect on our communities. There is no doubt that the NCA needs to be given more efficient and more effective tools in crime fighting operations. Strengthening the legislation regarding controlled operations and a more coordinated approach will significantly assist in this important public service.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>11208</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority entitled <inline font-style="italic">Street legal</inline> . The Democrats wish to add a significant and broad caveat to that report, which is outlined in the supplementary statement contained within that report. In that supplementary statement I have referred to the Ridgeway decision, the legislative response to it, issues of external authorisation, the public interest monitor, uniformity of laws and regulations, and the accountability issue. Our caveat is based on the increasingly common misconception that somehow civil liberties and human rights issues can be balanced or even traded against concerns about regulatory efficiency. This argument has arisen with increasing frequency and is playing an in 
 creasing role in debates about law enforcement. It is certainly an argument that has been raised in relation to an increase in powers for ASIO, as we have seen recently.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to draw attention to a common misconception which played an important part in the testimony of various law enforcement officers testifying before the joint committee. That misconception relates to the legal effect of the Ridgeway case. This is not an appropriate time for an in-depth analysis of the Ridgeway judgment but I do want to put some facts on the record. The Ridgeway case does not prohibit controlled operations. Courts have always possessed and have frequently invoked the discretion to exclude evidence obtained through impropriety or illegality. While law enforcement agencies have claimed that the High Court `unreasonably restricted the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect and break up drug rings', the application of the discretion was limited to those entrapment cases where the illegality was an integral part of the offence charged.</para><para>The Ridgeway case left considerable scope for controlled operations but law enforcement agencies were not comfortable with the level of uncertainty and immediately called for an administrative regime which could authorise the conduct of controlled operations, including those to which we are responding in the report of this inquiry. Contrary to statements contained in the preface of the chair's report, the Australian Democrats are not satisfied that there was sufficient debate on the merits of controlled operations legislation at the time of the passage of that legislation. There are a number of concerns that the Democrats believe should be addressed prior to any further codification or expansion of executive power. A number of these concerns are addressed in chapter 2 of the chair's report. It is the view of the Democrats that these concerns should be addressed prior to any further legislative action.</para><para>While balance is a noble and appropriate goal, many concerns must be understood outside the paradigm of efficiency. Some of the concerns are not able to be quantified and simply cannot be traded against law enforcement interests. The possible erosion of rights 
 is a major concern to us, and we believe it should be addressed again prior to further legislative action. One of the central recommendations of the report is the establishment of an authorisation regime relying on both internal and external authorisation.</para><para>The Democrats have a number of concerns with internal authorisation, based on the lack of independence and accountability. The Australian Democrats favour an external authorisation process, due to the need for both independence and accountability. However, the Democrats do agree with the concerns expressed about the operation of judicial authorisation mechanisms. Clearly, the nature of controlled operations and the inherent licensing of illegality make judicial involvement inappropriate if not constitutionally invalid.</para><para>We also wish to emphasise the need for a uniform national scheme. A number of witnesses referred to the jurisdictional problems involved in the current operations, and the previous speaker has done so as well. It would be extremely unfortunate if this inconsistency were allowed to continue. The Democrats do support an increased role for the parliamentary joint committee in the oversight of the National Crime Authority. However, as noted in the Chair's report, there is clearly a need for that role to be limited by the committee's primary task of overseeing the exercise of executive power. It would not be appropriate for the committee to be involved in the direct oversight of controlled operations, but there is clearly a role to be played in reviewing the operations of the legislative framework. I conclude with my conclusion from our report, and that is:</para><para>The Australian Democrats support the recommendations of the Chair's report, with the significant caveat that civil liberties concerns must not be weighed against efficiency considerations.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee </title><page.no>11209</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>11209</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>11209</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of Senator Cooney and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the following reports: <inline font-style="italic">27th report:

The rest of that group was reviewed in Report 25, and these two were held over in order to provide interested groups with the opportunity to comment on the proposal before us.</para><para>Similarly, there were seventeen proposed treaty actions tabled on 12 October 1999. We have held three of that group over, to allow interested groups more time to give us their views. Relevant Ministers have been informed, and we will report on these matters as soon as practicable.</para><para>Of the agreements in these two Reports, the most noteworthy is probably the proposed termination of the Social Security Agreement with the UK, in Report 27. For its own reasons, the UK Government has refused to index pensions paid under this long standing agreement to its pensioners in this country. We have supported termination of the Agreement, but recommended that an additional year's notice should be given to reduce the chances of hardship to those who might be effected.</para><para>The Department responsible for this Agreement appeared before us without having undertaken any consultations with community groups that might be effected. It was, of course, the first time that the Department of Family and Community Services had encountered this Committee and its process.</para><para>This Committee has now been in existence for three and a half years and, in terms of its emphasis on consultation, it has been very consistent. I would have thought that the importance of consultation of interested groups and individuals about proposed treaty actions would have dawned on every Government agency by now.</para><para>It was therefore alarming to find another example of lack of consultation in the treaties reviewed in Report 28. This was in relation to the Consular Agreement with the People's Republic of China. 
 While there are many Australia-Chinese business groups, no attempt had been made to contact any of them to ascertain what they thought about this proposed treaty.</para><para>This lack of action was from the agency responsible for managing the revised treaty-making process, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, making this lapse more worrying.</para><para>When he announced the establishment of the reformed treaty-making process in May 1996, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that consultation would be the key word. While I have already drawn attention to some lapses in this area in both Reports 27 and 28, in general the Minister's policy has been acted upon by most agencies, most of the time.</para><para>As our processes have settled down, we have attempted to extend our own consultative mechanisms. In June this year, the Committee held a very significant seminar, dealing with the involvement of Parliament in the treaty-making process.</para><para>One of the outcomes of that seminar was the expansion of our efforts to seek and use the views of the State and Territory Parliaments. Although we did not receive many comments from them for the treaties reviewed in these Reports, it seems that a number of the Parliaments are now looking at ways of involving themselves in this process. This can only make the revised treaty-making process in this country more effective.</para><para>The 15 sitting day rule under which we operate is, of course, going to limit the ability of State and Territory Governments and Parliaments to forward submissions to us in time for their comments to be included in our Reports.</para><para>Intensive use of such technologies as e-mail is, of course, playing a part in speeding the dispatch and receipt of material. We look forward to greater contributions from the State and Territory Governments and Parliaments.</para><para>These two Reports review a wide range of proposed treaty actions. We have made some additional comments, as well as recommending that binding treaty action be taken. We hope that the sponsoring agencies take note of these comments.</para><para>I commend Reports 27 and 28 to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>11210</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak to reports Nos 27 and 28 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Report No. 27 includes the committee's report and recommendations concerning two treaties. The first recommendation is that Australia terminate the social security agreement with the United Kingdom, and the second recommendation is that binding treaty action be taken by Australia with respect to 
 the new revised text of the International Plant Protection Convention.</para></talk.start><para>Report No. 28 comprises the committee's report on 14 treaties tabled on 12 October 1999. Reflecting Australia's broad international interests, these treaties establish fair, agreed and transparent rules to guide our nation's relationships in areas as diverse as the conservation and management of fish stocks; judicial assistance with the Republic of Korea; Australia's participation in the multinational force, and observers, in the Sinai; double taxation agreements to prevent tax evasion with Argentina and the Slovak Republic; mutual assistance in criminal matters with Monaco; two bilateral agreements for the safeguarding of the use of nuclear power and the sale of uranium; two telecommunications agreements; amendments to the agreement relating to the International Mobile Satellite Organization; cultural cooperation with Germany; and consular agreements with the People's Republic of China and the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. In all instances in report No. 28, the committee recommends that binding treaty action be taken.</para><para>Today, we often hear that Australia enters into treaties so that we might be acknowledged as good international citizens, and sometimes we hear that we enter treaties out of naivety or some sort of misguided altruism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Australia negotiates and enters into treaties because it serves our national interest to do so. As report No. 27 illustrates, Australia will terminate those international agreements when they no longer serve the interests of our community.</para><para>Under the existing social security agreement with the United Kingdom, Australians are missing out. Under our domestic legislation, Australia indexes benefits such as pensions that are being paid to former residents eligible for social security benefits living overseas, including those residing in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom government, however, does not index the cost of living to the benefits it pays if those eligible to receive benefits are residing outside the United Kingdom and living in Australia. All such 
 indexation benefits are frozen on the date the person leaves the UK for Australia or the date of the pension, whichever comes first.</para><para>As the UK refuses to index pensions it pays to people in Australia, this country is effectively subsidising the UK national insurance system in the vicinity of $100 million per year. Importantly, however, in recommending the termination of this treaty, the committee has recommended that the Minister for Family and Community Services take steps to ensure that former United Kingdom residents living in Australia are not disadvantaged by the proposed termination.</para><para>I hope to say a bit more about the important work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in tonight's adjournment debate. Suffice to say, recent protests in Seattle against free trade and globalisation in general, and the activities of the World Trade Organisation in particular, are a very timely reminder of the need to subject international agreements to scrutiny.</para><para>In the absence of public input, international organisations and international agreements are too readily perceived as nothing more than conspiracies and plots by special interests, pressure groups and unaccountable international bureaucrats. The echoes of Seattle should have convinced us all that our role in this parliament, and in particular in this committee, is to explain to Australians, and perhaps to others as well, how and why international agreements serve our national interests.</para><para> I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the committee secretariat, whose great patience with newcomers is matched only by their industry. I would also like to thank my colleagues in both houses and all parties for their contribution to the work of the committee, particularly our chairman, the Hon. Andrew Thomson, and the deputy chairman, Senator Barney Cooney. They encouraged all that is the very best in the practice of parliamentary committees in this country: decisions based upon a broad appreciation of the public interest, free of partisan reckoning but thankfully never devoid of principle.

I inform the Senate that the delegation was led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Neil Andrew. The deputy leader was Duncan Kerr and the other members of the delegation were Joel Fitzgibbon, David Hawker, Mrs Danna Vale and me. The secretary was Mr John Kain from the library. We visited the three countries of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus at a sensitive time. The wars in the Balkans have impacted on each of those countries, and we visited Cyprus during the 25th anniversary of Turkish intervention.</para></talk.start><para> Australia has strong social and cultural links with all three countries. There are over 600,000 Australian residents of Greek extraction, 100,000 of Turkish extraction, and a considerable number from Cyprus. I understand that the Australian Cypriot community is one of the largest outside Cyprus. These migrants have made a very rich contribution to Australiaâto its arts, media, cuisine and business. While none of these countries are major trading partners with Australia, they do offer important export growth and investment opportunities.</para><para> I have some comments on the economies of these countries. Firstly, I believe that the 
 Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 offers considerable investment potential for Australian businesses. Australian construction and related industries would be wise to take up those opportunities, given their experience in Sydney. Greece's economic orientation is, naturally, focused on Europe. It has been a full member of the European Union since 1981, and it is a significant net beneficiary of EU funding. It entered the European exchange rate mechanism in March 1998. In regard to economic policy, the government's stated top priority is to ensure that Greece achieves the convergence criteria to enable it to enter into the economic and monetary union. Towards this end, the government passed a very tight budget in 1998, imposed new taxes and curbed public expenditure. It also introduced significant changes in labour force arrangements, particularly applicable to publicly owned, debt-ridden companies such as Olympic Airways and the Greek post office. As well, there has been an extensive restructuring of the public education system. These changes have attracted significant public opposition, but the aim to be well and truly part of the European Union overrides all that.</para><para> Turkey is increasingly becoming an economic powerhouse in the region. I guess that not many Australians realise that there are 63 million people in Turkey and that the natural increase is a million and a half people each year. However, there have been significant problems in Turkey, particularly its internal upheaval as a result of its Kurdish problem. Already there has been a significant growth in our trading relationship with Turkey and, in recent years, there have been agriculture, animal husbandry and irrigation infrastructure developments between the two countries. The export of fast ferries to Turkey has also been noteworthy. It has a young and fast growing population and the government places a priority on improving its people's educational levels. But its education system is under considerable strain and this opens up opportunities for Australian educational institutions.</para><para> The Turkey-Australia economic relationship is supported by a number of bilateral agreements in such fields as trade and economic cooperation, migration and taxation. 
 Turkey has embarked upon a large-scale infrastructure development and modernisation program. The aftermath of the earthquake will certainly have an accelerating effect on this program. The outpouring of international assistance following the tragedy has also drawn Turkey closer to its neighbours in Europe. Particularly noteworthy was the response from Greece, because there has certainly been a lot of enmity between those two countries.</para><para> Cyprus is only a very small market but it does offer the potential as a bridgehead for the rapidly growing markets of the region. It is a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Australia-Cyprus relationship reflects the common institutional inheritances of our origins. Australian Federal Police force members attached to the United Nations civilian police have been serving on the demarcation line in Cyprus for many years. While we were there we met with the Federal Police representatives, and they were very pleased to see us.</para><para>All three countries are certainly oriented to Europe and, while Greece is already a member of the European Union, Turkey and Cyprus are very keen to join. That was a very strong theme that we encountered. We had a very worthwhile visit and I must say that the ambassadors looked after us very well; in fact they complimented us on coming to visit the countries in which they are stationed. Particularly as we were led by the Speaker, we had access to presidents and prime ministers, which would have been difficult to achieve otherwise. As the only senator on the committee, I wish to thank the countries, the embassies and the parliaments for their overwhelming hospitality, the great receptions they gave us, and the friendliness they showed to each and every one of us. It was a memorable occasion for all of us. In particular I thank the secretary of the committee, Mr John Kain, for this report.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>11212</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>11212</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>That Senator Ludwig replace Senator Collins on the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small

 step just a fraction outside the boundary for a fraction of a kilometre then you get the whole journeyâhundreds of kilometresâtax free.

 Let us compare operating a truck from a market garden within the urban conurbation and taking your produce to the central market with a market garden or winery that is outside the boundary of the urban conurbation. It may be just outside; it may be the next-door neighbour.

So a woodchip truck or a truck carrying wastepaper which commences its journey, say, outside the conurbation is treated in exactly the same way. A woodchip truckâand this is for the 4.5-tonne to 20-tonne trucksâwhose journey is solely within the conurbation is treated the same way as a wastepaper truck. You are trying to make a distinction and trying to make a point by ignoring the facts and realities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This does not discriminate. What we are trying to do is provide a significant benefit to rural and regional Australia, to the battlers out there. This will deliver significant benefits to the battlers. Don't you dare hide behind the fact that this is the big corporations. That may make it slightly easier for your conscience, Senator, but you would be missing the point. 
 These arrangements under the ANTS package will be of benefit to battlers in regional and rural Australia, including those battlers who are driving trucks on these long journeys. So do not try to calm your conscience by trying to wipe this by saying that this all goes to the big end of town, because you would be wrong. It is about time that you showed a bit of consideration, Senator Brown, for the battlers in this country instead of always trying to deny them jobs.

What I am putting to him is a real set of circumstances. The woodchip truck does come out of the forests, it does go into the city, it does export its woodchips to Japan and it does get subsidised by the government under this scheme. But the recycling truck that I described does start its journey in the city, it does go around the city streets collecting paper for recycling and it does go to the recycling facilityâand does the environment a great turn by doing thatâbut it gets no subsidy. It is discriminated against yet again under this Democrats-government package.</para></talk.start><para> On the issue of the battlers, the point is that this is a $3-billion rebate scheme we are talking about and $2 billion of that is going to the mining corporations, according to government ministers, the minister's own colleagues. A huge slice of the rest will go to transport corporations. In the relative order of things it is small but in terms of forests, and we will be getting on to that shortly, it is the woodchip corporations that will get the big advantage out of this.</para><para>The last time I spoke to a group of truckies, at close quarters, they were in my office because this minister's party in Tasmania had stood by while they were sacked by one of these woodchip corporations.

Then I read in the paper just a couple of weeks ago that a whole bunch more truckies had been sacked by woodchip corporations, under the regional forest agreement which the Prime Minister signed with 
 the promise that there would not be any jobs lost.

But we do not have that option under the regulation route. We will look with interest at the boundaries of these so-called urban conurbations.</para><para>I want to make a comment about battlers. What concerns me about the Liberal-National approach is that we know that there are 
 battlers in the trucking industry, but they are not just in rural and regional Australia. I have met and talked to drivers who operate in urban conurbationsâin Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, wherever these boundaries are going to be. I have met couriers and drivers in the trucking industry who operate just in those areas, and they are battlers too, Senator Kemp. So we are going to have the battlers in the bush and rural and regional Australia who are advantaged over the battlers in urban conurbations. That is not treating people in the same business equitably. It is unfair. Senator Kemp, what you are saying is that you care about battlers in rural and regional Australia but you do not care about battlers in the outer suburbs of Australia's large cities, and there are a lot of battlers there.</para><para>From reading the press this week and last week, I think a number of your backbenchers from those outer urban areas and those so-called conurbations are getting a little bit nervous about the approach of this government on policy areas. This is a prime example of battlers in one area being assistedâand there is no argument about thatâwhen, in the same industry, people on low incomes, working extraordinary hours, in urban areas are not going to be advantaged. They are in the same industry. In some cases, they will be competing against each other. It is a very competitive industry, as I think anyone who has participated in or listened to this debate knows.</para><para>We are just about to come to a close, but there is another point that I want to raise, Senator Kemp: the issue of private roads versus public roads. I understand the legislation applies only to public roads. I would think that there are a lot of journeys in this country where at least part of the journey is on a private roadâacross a propertyâand that may form a considerable part of the journey. Again, it depends on how these boundaries are drawn. I do not see a valid reason why the distances travelled on private roads should not be allowed. The minister may be able to give me an answer to that. It just seems to me to be a bit unfair if you have some distance to drive on a private road, and 
 I am sure we do have those circumstances existing in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>11230</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are aware of this issue.

What concerns us about urban conurbations versus 
 non-urban conurbations is that it requires new boundaries to be drawn. Inevitably, when new boundaries are drawn, there will be anomalies. There will have to be enforcement at those boundary points for obvious reasons. That will have to mean additional regulation, additional bureaucracy and additional cost for the trucking industry in this country. We had some discussion about battlers. We have battlers in rural and regional Australia in the trucking industry; equally, we have battlers in urban areas of Australia in the so-called urban conurbations.</para></talk.start><para>The maps showing the boundaries have not been presented to the Senate.

As I said, we do not blame him for negotiating this. He was not involved in the process, as I understand. He has to defend it as a representative of the Democrats, the party that did the appalling deal with the Liberal-National Party on the goods and services tax, but he has not even done that. He has not defended it at all or attempted to explain it. Urban conurbation versus rural and regional was the Democrats' idea, as we understand it. He has not attempted to explain in any detail what was meant by this approach. Those aspects have been disappointing to us.</para><para>We have not had satisfactory explanations about the costings and the basis for those costings. We will be supporting this bill. We do not accept the government's assurances that prices in the bush are going to go down and that the price of goods and services will drop. We have had recent examples of the Prime Minister backing away from his assurances with respect to motor vehicles, for example. We were told in the lead-up to the last election that motor vehicle prices would go down by an average of $3,000, and the Prime Minister is backing away from that 
 rapidly. There is a range of other areas with respect to the goods and services tax. This week the Senate will be expected to pass a total of over 1,000 amendments to the goods and services tax package. Presumably there are at least 1,000 errors that need to be rectified. Very shortly, we will be passing on to the next piece of legislation, which the government has described as a mistake. We will make some comments on that legislation when we get to it.</para><para>The range of explanations and responses from the ministerâand when he has not been here, his representative, the parliamentary secretary, Senator Ian Campbellâhas not been particularly satisfactory. I think we raised quite legitimate questions on behalf of the trucking industry in this country, which will have to put up with the enforcement procedures, increased bureaucracy and some of the uncertainties that will arise as a result of the boundaries and the additional cost that will flow through.</para><para>There are two matters that the government may be considering. Firstly, I understand at some time in the past there has been discussion about colour-coding the diesel to try to use that as a basis for some sort of enforcement system. I would be interested to know whether or not you are discussing that in this context. Secondly, is it the government's intention to consider satellite tracking of trucks? That might sound a little absurd to some people, but I know in the fishing industry satellite tracking technology is used with respect to the location of fishing vessels.</para><para>I will conclude my remarks there and hope that we get some reasonably satisfactory answers to the new questions I have raised. That concludes the Labor Party's remarks on this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>11231</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn relation to colour coding and satellite tracking, the government is not planning these sorts of changes at this stage.</para></talk.start><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para><inline ref="r916">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</inline></para><para>The bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>11231</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1A  Subsection 164(1)</inline></para><para>	 Omit "subsections (2)", insert "subsections (2), (2A)".</para><para>(2)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), after item 1A, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1B  After subsection 164(2)</inline></para><para>	 Insert:</para><para>	 (2A)	 A person is not entitled to be paid diesel fuel rebate, or to retain diesel fuel rebate paid to the person, in respect of diesel fuel purchased by the person for use by the person in a manner referred to in subsection (1) that is specified in the application for that rebate if the person uses the fuel:</para><para>		 (a)	 in forestry operations in native forest; or</para><para>		 (b)	 in forestry operations in plantation forest where such forestry operations involve any clearing of native forest.</para><para>(3)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 6), after item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1C  Subsection 164(7)</inline></para><para>	 Insert:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> forest</inline>  means a vegetation community dominated by trees with a projective foliage cover greater than 30%.</para><para>(4)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 6), after item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1D  Subsection 164(7)</inline></para><para>	 Insert:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> native forest</inline>  means forest dominated by tree species native to the locality in which it occurs and where natural regeneration processes operate either fully or in part for recovery of canopy structure following natural or artificial disturbance.</para><para>(5)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 6), after item 1, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1E  Subsection 164(7)</inline></para><para>	 Insert:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"> plantation</inline>  means an area of trees planted and managed in an agricultural context for purposes including wood production</para><para>(6)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 7), before item 2, insert:

Before I get on to the terminology of the legislation itself, I ask the minister whether he would look at the Prime Minister's letter to Senator Meg Lees of 28 May this year, which consummated the agreement on the GST and, therefore, the diesel fuel rebate grant package, as he might like to label this piece. At page 7, under the heading `Off-road diesel and light fuels', it statesâand these are the Prime Minister's wordsâ`The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be not for forestry'.

If we had any doubt about that, we could look at Deputy Prime Minister Anderson's comments when he commenced the second speech. It was not a press release; it was a second reading speech. He stated that the bill:</para><para>. . . implements changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate scheme agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000.</para><para>We then had Senator Greig at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which considered this legislation. Page E24 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record reads:</para><para>Senator GREIGâI have some sympathy for these guys from the ATO. They are not in a 
 position to answer that. But, as far as the Democrats are concerned, the position is not unclear.</para><para>Senator CONROYâSo, is forestry in or out?</para><para>This is in reference to the diesel fuel rebate. The discussion continued:</para><para>Senator GREIGâIt is out.</para><para>Senator CONROYâDoesn't this bill put it back in?</para><para>Senator GREIGâIt does.</para><para>So we have a position where the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister clearly and explicitly agreed to delete the forest industries from benefits relating to the diesel fuel rebate. Senator Kemp would have the Senate chamber believe that this was inadvertent. It clearly was not inadvertent. It was a deliberate part of the package that they signed up to with the Democrats to exclude the forest industries. That is fact. It is very clear. It is on the public record. I do not think we have got a clearer record of what the facts are.</para><para>So it is totally wrong for the minister to describe the legislation we are now considering that puts the forest industries back under the diesel fuel concession as `a mistake', or `an oversight' or `inadvertent'. The minister is just misleading the chamber and he knows it. We take exception to that. We should not be in the mess we are in on the diesel fuel rebate in respect of the forest industry. This has caused a lot of uncertainty in forest industries. In my home state of Tasmania there was great concern.

We have always known Senator Brown's position, but the Democrats waxed lyrical and made triumphant claims about the environmental credentials that they had in negotiating this package. The Democrats claimed, on the one hand, that the GST was a great environmental package. It was not, but 
 they claimed that. And yet here you have a clear example of this government welshing on the agreement. Nothing could be clearer. Why are the Australian Democrats supporting the GST package? If excluding forest industries from the diesel fuel rebate was so important, so critical for the environment and part of your grand negotiations, why have you allowed the government to do this? Why have you allowed the government to go back on their word? That is what you are doing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You can pull the rug from under them. You can say, `It was part of the GST package; put it back in or else.' But you are not doing that. I have not seen any critical public comments by you or other Democrat spokespersons on this issue. You sit down and you negotiate. I do not agree with the deal you reached with the government, but you sit down, you sign off, you negotiate in good faith. If it is not delivered, you say, `Well, you have walked away. We are not going to vote for this GST package.'</para><para>That is my understanding of negotiations. If you do not deliver on the detail, you do not have a deal. The Democrats are being played for suckers on this issue. The government knows that Labor will support, as we always have done, forest industries and making sure that the diesel fuel rebate covers forest industries. The Liberals know our position. So they know this is going to pass, Senator Greig. They are playing you for suckers. I think it is a sorry day for the Democrats. There is still legislation to consider on the GST package. You can still say to the government, `Deliver or else.' You are not prepared to do that. I think that is duplicitous. You are just going along with a breach of the deal and the agreement.</para><para>They are the points I wanted to make. I am sorry to interrupt Senator Brown. I do not agree with some of his comments about forest industries, but on the points of principle Senator Brown is quite correct about what has happened.

 off-road industries by the deal signed between Senator Meg Lees and the Prime Minister, John Howard, specifically excluding off-road forestry uses. Then that became known, and the government moved to turn it around to give that advantage to forestry as well, so that they would not be disadvantaged. The difference is between a rebate of 35c per litre and 43c. That is where the 8c comes from.</para></talk.start><para>Basically what we are doing here is catching up and giving a rebate of 43c instead of 35c. That was not there, because the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, specifically excluded it in their pact of 28 May. The Leader of the Democrats asserted that a number of times in the public debate following. In fact, on 29 June Senator Lees, attacking me, said:</para><para>In this bill we have increased the costs for forestry by 8c a litre. It is probably not something that we should point out to the National Party, but there it is, and that is what we have done in this legislation. So for himâ</para><para>that is, meâ</para><para>to stand up here yet again and react to anything we try to do on the environment with his incessant undermining and incessant complaining is appalling.</para><para>Who is appalling? With a whimper, the Democrats have allowed the Prime Minister to welsh on a deal that they signed up to. They are going to vote against this measure in here, knowing that Labor is supporting it and therefore there is going to be no change. That is a very base form of politics.</para><para>The fact is that the industry was quite chuffed when it got the turnaround. The National Association of Forest Industries, in its press release on 2 September, said:</para><para>The industry is grateful to Mr Tuckey for pursuing vigorously this rectification of a mistake, the benefit of which will be felt by forestry operators in regional Australia.</para><para>That is as may be, but what we have is a statement of principle by the Democrats, viewed then as a mistake by the government under industry pressure, and a total turnaround, a breach of the agreement not just by Prime Minister Howard but by Democrat leader Senator Lees herself. She has not said one word in defence of that change. Last week, at the end of the debate on this matter, 
 I asked that Senator Lees come into this committee and explain this change. She has not. Senator Allison is missing. So it is left to Senator Greig, who was not there to put his signature on the agreement with the Prime Minister.</para><para>What we have is a clear case of the Democrat leadership not having the gumption to stand by an agreement which just a few short months ago they were beating their chests about as a means of scoring political points. They know that this will not be reported. Forestry issues in the main will not be reported by the press gallery. So they know that they can stay in their rooms, ignore this major change on a matter of principle, as they put it in May and June, and get away with it. And there is nothing to be done about that except to record it.</para><para>I hear in the last 24 hours another member of the Democrats is talking about their meeting a need to change another piece of legislation to protect people who might be taxed on lamington drives. It has been obvious for yearsâat least two yearsâthat that tax was going to be in place. Did the Democrats at any stage in their discussions with the Prime Minister say charities should be protected? No, they did not. But now the heat is applied, they are going to renege.</para><para>They are going to try to appear as if they have been the protectors of the public interest, just as they were doing a while ago over forestry. On that occasion the loggers moved in, Mr Tuckey moved in and the Democrats caved. On this occasion they will be quite happy to change again an agreement they made, because they are not prepared to stand with that agreement. But it is there in black and white and nothing is going to change that, I guess. It just means that there has been a change in the political landscape in this place. The members of the opposition are quite right in pointing to that as well.</para><para>It is a pretty poor sign that, on a matter as important as this, the leadership of the Democrats cannot come down and say, `We did not make a mistake, because we at the time pointed out that this was a win for us. What we have done in the meantime is quietly cave in on the environment'âand of all things on 
 the forest environmentâ`over which we have been marching in the streets and protesting in years gone by. We are now going to support legislation which is going to subsidise the bulldozers at work in the wild forests of Australia, and we are not going to say a word about it.' That is the difference.</para><para>The other question I put to the minister is the one on agriculture. He says that this is simply ensuring that forestry as an agricultural industry gets the same benefits as the rest of the agricultural industry. I ask the minister this: is the logging of wilderness forests, which have never been touched before by any industry, agriculture?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>11237</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are seeking to maintain the status quo.

The point I am making to you is that we are seeking to maintain the status quo; we are not seeking to give an additional advantage.

I think it is an important question, and Senator Brown has been pursuing it very well and I think accurately. The Prime Minister's letter to the Leader of the Australian Democrats I think makes it fairly clear. My question, how did you get it so wrong, is relevant. You say that the government's position did not change; it was always the same. It never intended to commit to the Democrats to not allow the forest industry access to the additional 8c a litre. I think that is fairly clear in the Prime Minister's letter, as has been pointed out by Senator Brown. What is interesting in the Prime Minister's letter is that in the second-last paragraph of the letter he says:</para></talk.start><para>Moreover, the offer is subject to the Democrats supporting the funding arrangements and any consequential amendments necessary to implement this package.</para><para>The package is the ANTS package.

We have the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the consideration of legislation referred to the committee, the  Taxation Laws Amendment 
 Bill (No. 9) 1999 , a report signed by the chairman of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Gibson, who is a government member. But if we go to the back of the report we find a minority report signed by the Australian Democrats which says:</para><para>After careful consideration of the evidence before the Committee on this bill, the Australian Democrats are still of the view that it should be opposed. We urge the Labor Party to oppose it also.</para><para>The Democrats know what our position was with respect to the GST. We went through this exercise where the Democrats reached an agreement with the government to pass the GST legislation lock, stock and barrel subject to a set of arrangements, one of which was the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in respect of forestry.</para><para>Senator Brown has pointed out from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record the statements that were made by Senator Lees and Senator Allison on a number of occasions which are a total contradiction of what you, Minister, have been saying here for the last almost 50 minutes. With the greatest of respect to you, what you have said would seem to be a contradiction of what your Prime Minister has said. You have been saying, `Look, we never intended for the status quo to change,' but the proposal before us in terms of amendment bill No. 9 does change the status quo. From the Labor Party point of view we do not oppose that, but what we are very interested in, and certainly I am very interested in, is how we get your story to fit with the Democrat story; how we get your position to fit with their position.</para><para>As Senator Brown rightly points out, why isn't Senator Lees or Senator Allisonâor indeed Senator Murray, who was acknowledged in the Prime Minister's letterâin here to actually discuss and debate this issue? It was part of a deal to support a whole new tax regime that would increase taxation on a whole host of people in this country. Of course, the government proceeded to write the letter, and the Prime Minister very clearly made the point that this would not apply to forestry. This was after some degree of pressure. I have to say that this is where Senator Brown and I might slightly part company. I support the view that the 8c ought 
 to be paid to the forest industry. But, you see, this is a question of integrity, credibility and honesty on the part of the government and how you treat those people that you negotiate with at the other end of the chamber. The report signed by Senator Gibson says, in the section headed `Background to the bill':</para><para>1.5. The relevant part of the Government/Australian Democrats agreement was to exclude the forest industry from receiving the full diesel rebate. This decision meant that for the first time parity was broken between the various primary production sectors. Consequently, the forest and timber industries pay 8c per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries.</para><para>I understand that is exactly the point everybody has been trying to make to you, Senator Kemp, but you have been trying to say, `Oh, it was inadvertent, a mistake.' I think your Prime Minister and indeed your minister for resources clearly understood the circumstances; I know the Treasurer did. You were desperadoes and to get your ANTS package up per se you signed a letterâor the Prime Minister did on your behalf and on the rest of the government's behalfâthat gave a commitment to the Australian Democrats that this would not be the case.</para><para>Senator Gibson, the author of the report who was on a committee which has a government majority, has allowed this statement to be madeâin the opening paragraphs of the report in a statement of background to the billâexplaining exactly what this bill would have achieved and you, Minister, have now spent 50 minutes trying to tell us, `No, no, noânot us. We never intended that.' If that is so, I do not know what led the forest industry, NAFI and the Australian forest growers to appear before the committee screaming blue murder that somehow you had dudded them, which has subsequently led to you wanting to change it all. On the basis of inadvertency? No, I do not think so, Minister.

It ought not to have had to go to her, because she ought to have spoken up in the public arena, but she did not.	She has turned her back on the forests when they needed her and when she could have made a difference. I am not the one who says that: she said so herself. She said so in this place, and so did environment spokesperson Senator Allison. They both berated me for saying that they had not stood by the forests back in June and said, `We have. We've made a difference here.' This fuel rebate is a subsidy to the machines that work in our wild forests. But they are absent tonight. They are not going to come in here, and they are not going to stand by the forests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>11241</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should indicate at this stage that we will not be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Brown. I will also briefly indicate the reasons. On the substance of the debate that has occurred to date, you could summarise each party's position as follows. Labor has always held the view that the diesel fuel rebate should apply to forest industries. Those operators who use skippers, generators, bulldozers, cranes, portable sawmillers, chippers, chainsaws and the other range of machinery and forest operations should 
 receive the diesel fuel rebate. Labor has been very consistent on that. We have never suggested that it should be taken away. By way of example, in my home state of Tasmania, where forestry represents 15 per cent of the economy, thisâcall it what you likeâsubsidy or payment represents $2 million a year to the forest industries. From a personal perspective, I agreeâand the Labor Party also agreeâthat the diesel fuel rebate should apply. That has been Labor's position.</para></talk.start><para>The Liberal Party and the Democrats agreed to take the diesel fuel rebate away from the forest industries as part of the GST deal. The government and Senator Kemp say that it was inadvertent, but it was quite deliberately negotiated. I do not know what the National Party was doing at the time. The National Party allowed the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to negotiate away the diesel fuel rebate for the forest industry in rural and regional areas.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>âWe like to ambush!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âThe problem, Senator McGauranâthrough you, Mr Temporary Chairmanâis that, for some months, this has caused a great deal of uncertainty and worry amongst forest industries and amongst forest workers. You are saying no, but it did. You just have to look at the committee evidence or talk to some of the forest operators who are next door to you in Collins Street in Melbourne. They will explain to you the very nasty impact this is going to have. But the National Party dropped the ball.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats did a deal to exclude forestry. They walked away from the table. They had signed up to the deal, they had stated it publicly and the government has reneged. We have had nothing from the Democrats other than Senator Greig's comments in here again tonight. The Democrats know the position and appear to be quite relaxed and comfortable to let the government break the deal they signed with them. If someone breaks a deal you apply a sanction, and the sanction is, through you Mr Temporary Chairman to Senator Greig, that you say to the government, `You are backtracking on part of the package that we negotiated.' But you are not prepared to hold the government accountable, and from 
 that point of view I am very disappointed in the Democrats. You are not prepared to hold the government accountable to a deal that you signed up to. So you cannot with any credibility claim that you have done what you said you would do: defend the forest industries.</para><para> As I say, as a matter of principle and from a policy perspective we do not agree with you on that. You have tried to have it every which way and you have accomplished nothing as a result of what you have tried to do. Senator Brown, as I have said, has been consistent. We have all known Senator Brown's position. Unlike the Democrats, he has been consistent on the principles and issues that he has always been very clear on. That is to his credit, even though I and the Labor Party do not agree with some of those principles that he enunciates. I do not know where One Nation stands on this issue as we have not heard from them to date.</para><para> We will not be supporting the amendments. Firstly, as I have said, Labor have always believed that the diesel fuel rebate should apply to the total forest industry. Secondly, Senator Brown is attempting via his amendments to separate plantation forests from native forests so that the diesel fuel rebate would apply to plantation operations but not to native forests. That would create an uneven playing field between the two sectors of the forest industry. Senator Brown is not giving the total picture, of course. Native forests are not all wilderness forests; in fact, only a very small proportion of native forests are wilderness forests. The vast majority of native forest that is logged in this country is regrowth; it has been logged before. To attempt to split it in this way and disadvantage native forest logging over plantation operations is inappropriate. Some logging of some native forests is appropriate. In some areas that is what the RFA process has been all about.</para><para> I conclude by saying that there is a real debate emerging now about plantation forestry. Plantation forestry is monoculture. It is growing a crop on a 15- or 20-year cycle. You do not have any diversity of wildlifeâof the flora and faunaâin plantation forests. By its very definition it is monoculture. We are starting to see a significant reaction to planta 
 tions in Tasmania for those reasons and for others. We do not want this debate to go too late so, from a Labor perspective, we have made the points we need to make. We will not be supporting the amendments, and I am very disappointed in the approach of the Australian Democrats to this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>11243</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs we are speaking directly, or ought to be speaking directly, to Senator Brown's amendments, I want to make it very clear that they have the full support of the Australian Democrats.

But as we saw in the debate on the previous legislation, we had a set of circumstances where the forest industry was going to be treated unequally in terms of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We have seen a whole raftâI think some 1,100âof amendments proposed for the ANTS package, the latest of which relates to the debacle of the charitable organisations, where we had a position put out on behalf of the government that charitable organisations will be required to support the government's position before they will actually receive their grants.</para></talk.start><para> A number of matters were raised in meetings of the Economics References Committee with respect to A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill 1999  and taxation bills No. 8 and No. 9. These included the pay as you go withholding system and PAYG instalments; collection and recovery rules; binding oral advice on income tax matters; payment; the Australian business number and identification verification system; a shorter period of 
 review for taxpayers with simple tax affairs; endorsement of deductible gift recipients and tax exempt charitiesâand we now have a clearer view of the government's position on that; administration of the business activity statement obligation; and provisional tax technical correction.</para><para>We have seen a whole raft of potential impacts, and I am glad Senator Minchin has just come into the chamber because another matter that has arisen is the impact this package has had on the car industry. We know how many times Senator Minchinâin response to questions from us and in response to dorothy dixers from his own sideâhas tried to imply that the circumstances in the car industry as a result of the ANTS package are all hunky-dory. He has tried to imply publicly that sales of passenger vehicles are exactly the same as they have been in recent years; in fact on one occasion I think he said that they were even better. I will be very interested to hear what Senator Minchin has to say about the most recent reports.</para><para>Senator Kemp, in response to a question today about the car industryâa dorothy dixer from Senator Fergusonâsaid, `Look, the November figures were slightly down on last year, but I will check that.' Perhaps Senator Minchin might be able to inform us more accurately of that. More importantly, he ought to be able to inform us about claims that the car industry is now experiencing a 16 per cent downturnâsomething that we have been pointing out to the government for some time in respect of the impact this package of bills is having. The Ford factory is now in shut-down mode, and, according to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, the Director of the Motor Traders' Association, Jim Gibbons, said that `the slowdown had been pronounced since June'. Certainly the minister has been telling us since June that all is well and that things are sailing along. Up until last week, the minister, the Prime Minister and everybody else on the government side were saying that cars were going to be cheaper. What has happened? The Prime Minister all of a sudden has said, `Oh, well, perhaps they won't be cheaper. Perhaps the poor old punters out there are not going to get cheaper cars.'</para><para>Part of this bill deals with the treatment of charities, and it has now been exposed exactly what the circumstances are really going to be for charities. It is very important, in consideration of all of the amendments to the ANTS package, that we take account of all of these things. The government has told us from the outset that nothing would be a problem, that they had worked this out thoroughly, and that there would not be an impact on this and there would not be an impact on that. The chickens are really coming home to roost, and the government has some major problems.</para><para>The Democratsânone of whom are currently in the chamberâwere the party that helped pass this legislation, and they have sort of disappeared into thin air. We have just had a debate on the diesel fuel rebate scheme and the forest industry. Senator GreigâI do not know if he was even in the Senate when the negotiations took place between Senator Lees and Senator Murray on behalf of the Democratsâhas had to sign a minority report saying that they were opposed to the forest industry receiving the additional 8c a litre, when in fact his party leader and the economic spokesman of the party had agreed with the Prime Minister that that would not be the case. They negotiated an arrangement to pass an overall tax package that has problems, for charities and for nursing homes, in terms of imposing an increased tax on the general public of this country. They came in here and championed their participation in and support for the ANTS package as being of great importance. They said they had succeeded in significantly protecting the environment. They  said they had achieved a new outcome for the environment, but  nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>As this whole package has been unravelling, so has the deal that the Democrats have done with the government. There are some major impacts as a result of this. I know the car industry is important to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a senator from South Australia. The minister is a senator from South Australia who has said on many occasions, `The opposition has it all wrong. Car sales have not slumped. It is all okay. It is all plain sailing. Of course, even if there was a 
 slight downturn, they will make it up after 1 July 2000, because car prices will go down and all the Mr and Mrs Averages are going to rush out and buy new cars, so things will be really fantastic.'</para><para>I note that Senator Ferguson has come into the chamberâanother senator from South Australia; and the one who has asked the dorothy dixers of the minister in respect of the car industry and the sales within the car industry. Senator Ferguson might also like to make a contribution about the most recent reports in the newspaper with respect to the slump in passenger car sales. I have made the point to the minister before that the figures that he has used in the past do not actually reflect car sales, that they in fact reflect overall vehicle sales, including Mack trucks. I do not know any families who have a Mack truck to use as their family car. There may be one or two, but I am certainly not aware of any. It would seem to me that they would be fairly expensive to buy in the first place and even more expensive to run. But, of course, the minister wanted to roll all of those, including other trucks and other vehicles, into the overall sale of vehicles. What the minister has failed to address, and what the car industry has been very concerned about, as Mr Gibbons points out, is that since June there has been a marked downturn. That has been a major problem.</para><para>We have also had as part of this package of bills the issue that relates to the payment of the new 16c a litre in terms of the new diesel grants scheme and the conurbations in respect of trucks between 4.5 and 20 tonnes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>âAre they big trucks?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âNo. I understand big trucks remain exempt. We may have to consult Senator Macdonald on big trucks. He is not in the chamber at the moment, but he may come in later and tell us a bit more about big trucks. We do not know what the administration process will be for that particular program. Senator Kemp earlier tried to convince us that the Australian Taxation Officeâwho are so well versed and so expert on the self-assessment processâwould have it all worked out and that they would be able to 
 deal with the problems. But I do not think so. This is the Taxation Office who appeared before the Economics Legislation Committeeâwho Senator Kemp claims knows it allâand we did not get too good an explanation from them. They said, `This is a new scheme and it will have its problems,' and they acknowledged problems in the past with the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and its application.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This whole package seems to be unravelling. In terms of the administration of the package, we do not know what the cost to business will be. I cannot recall the figure that the government stated in the package originally, but it was only small. It is now being assessed at something like $3 billion. All in all, I think the amendments that we are going to deal with during the course of maybe finally passing some sort of legislation will throw into major confusion the businesses of this country, the taxpayers of this country and also transportâin respect of which the National Party thought they got a good deal for the bush. The Victorians did not think too much of the good deal for the bush.

The only thing I found out in the whole of the 20 minutes that you were talking was that there is some chance, after all, that the Labor Party do not like the wholesale sales tax system, because just before you finished speaking you said, `We might or might not want to keep the wholesale sales tax system.' This is a revelation. I am wondering whether Senator Murphy ought inform Mr Beazley. Certainly Mr Latham would want to know. There just may be a tax policy in the wind, formulated while Senator Murphy was fly-fishing. He probably knows that he paid 22 per cent on his fly-fishing tackle; if it was not 22 per cent, it was probably 32 per centâI am not sure. The thing that he is really narky about is the fact that he has paid his 32 per cent and, if he had waited a while, he would have had to pay only 10 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>It really is a revelation. After all this time, the Labor Party do not like the wholesale sales tax.

They believe in higher taxes and broken promises. Senator Murphy was not here for the 1993 election. Senator Collins certainly was not. Although it is a fair time ago, I vaguely remember that in the 1993 election the Labor Party promised income tax cuts with no sales tax increases. That was their policy: cut income tax and no sales tax increases.</para><para>What did we do after the 1993 election? True to form, the Labor Party broke its 
 promise, took away the income tax cuts and increased sales taxes. That is the sort of policy you get from the Labor Party. With Senator Murphy coming in here and saying, `We might or might not want to keep the wholesale sales taxes,' it is about time he went to his party and talked to Mr Latham, Mr Beazley, Mr Crean and all those other people who may have some input into policyâalthough they obviously have not yet had any input because we are yet to see a policy. Then we might find out what the Labor Party believes in.</para><para> This partyâthe governmentâhas always believed that we require a modern, competitive tax system, something the Labor Party has never heard ofâa tax system that provides incentives to save, to invest, to create jobs and to increase living standards.

One reason that there are amendments to the bill is that this is a government that consults. It listens to the representations made to it. Since the announcement and the initial passage of the legislation, there has been a lot of consultation. A lot of representations have been made to the government because of certain aspects of this bill. The government has been true to its word. It has said that it wants to have a tax system which is both competitive and does not disadvantage people. So it has been prepared to make the changes that you will see in the amendments in this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a situation where the Labor Party is probably the only party left in the OECD countries that thinks that wholesale sales tax is the right way to tax a country today. Senator Murphy is gradually changing that view. I think he knows that it is not nice being the only party out of all the recognised developed countries in the world that actually favours a wholesale sales tax. I think Senator Murphy has a future in the Labor Party. He is showing a bit of foresight, something 
 nobody else has shown for years and years. It might not be a bad idea if, next time he goes fly-fishing, he takes Mr Crean, Mr Beazley and probably even Senator Quirkeâalthough Senator Quirke is much better at some other sports than fly-fishingâup there to a get a bit of the fresh air that he got. They may actually change their view and show enough foresight to realise that, when you are the only party in the recognised developed countries of the world that thinks that a wholesale sales tax is right for today, it is time to change your mind.</para><para>I congratulate Senator Murphy. He has shown in his speech tonight that at least he is someone who has some foresight. Some would say that Mr Latham is the leader of policy in the Labor Party, that he is the only one with any foresight. He is the sort of person who might lead the Labor Party into the next millennium because at least he has some modern ideas. But now we have Senator Murphy as well. Between the two of them, there is a chance that we might reinvigorate the Labor Party and have a bit of a resurgence of policy ideas. Quite honestly, they are not going to have too much difficulty because currently they are working in a policy vacuum. There are no policies. Senator Murphy, once again, I congratulate you.</para><para>Senator Murphy raised a number of issues in his speech. One was the car industry. Senator Murphy comes from Tasmania.

He said that he understood all about rural Australia. He understands a lot about rural Australia because it is pretty hard to go fly-fishing in the cities. Most of the time that Senator Murphy goes fly-fishing, he has to go into the country. He goes to very pretty places. He says he understands a lot about rural Australia, but he does not understand how much rural Australia welcomes the new 
 tax policy of this government. There is scarcely a personâI use the word `person' carefullyâwho does not believe that the wholesale sales tax system that we had was totally out of date and was hindering production. It hindered exports. The sales tax that was in-built into the cost of exports impinged on the cost of the goods that could be exported.

To the best of my knowledge, he had no input into these bills that are going through the parliament or the changes that are being made. Senator Murphy said that he did not mind things changing as long as they represented a change for the better. He has proved that. He has changed his thinking. He is now considering the removal of the wholesale sales tax. That is the first piece of good news for years. That might be a change for the better in his thinking. If he can convince his party to do the same thing and to support the removal of sales tax, that is a change for the better. I quite understand why he thinks that it would be a change for the better.</para><para>The Labor Party is tied to an antiquated, unfair and complex tax system.

It does not want to give any tax relief to those people in Australia who are paying the highest rates at the middle level of income. They are the people who have suddenly gone up to the highest rate of taxation and are earning $35,000 per year. Senator Murphy may think that a person who earns $35,000 per year is wealthy. However, they are paying the highest rate of taxation. They are paying the highest rate of marginal income tax at $35,000. Senator Murphy considers that they are wealthy because he does not want to give them any income tax cuts.</para><para>We are a party that believes that people earning between $35,000 and $50,000 are not wealthy.

It was not in favour of that at all. They said that you must not give tax cuts to the wealthy, the people earning $35,000 per year. They consider them to be wealthy. It is probably less than half of what Senator Murphy gets.</para><para>We have always believed that in order to deliver those income tax cuts there had to be a change to the whole taxation system. That is exactly what we did; we reformed the whole taxation system. We have given Australia a competitive taxation system for the next century.

It was passed into law last July so that people had 12 months to know exactly what they were going to be faced with after 1 July 2000.</para><para>In drawing that plan together, we made sure that people who needed help would not be affected by the system. We talk about health, education, child care, food, local government rates, water and sewerage charges. All those things will be GST free.

This means that 80 per cent of Australians will no longer pay any more than 30 per cent income tax.</para><para>This is something that the Labor Party could only ever dream about. Many Labor Party supporters and previous Labor Party supporters believe that the strong point of our taxation plan was that it gave some relief in income tax rates to those on middle incomes. They are the people who have been hurt most by the Labor Party's taxation system, which gave them very high income tax rates and very high wholesale sales tax rates. The Labor Party never talk about the 32 per cent sales tax rates that they were applying to people on the lowest incomes. It was 32 per cent for goods that attracted that rate. There was never an endeavour to make it any easier.</para><para>In fact, all they did after 1993 was to put the rates up. They promised they would not put them up. It was a typical Labor Party 
 election promise: `We will give you income tax cuts and we won't raise any other taxes.' But, once they were re-elected, what did they do? They forgot all about the income tax cuts. They made sure they were not delivered and put up the sales tax rates. That is the Labor Party's way. That is the Labor policy: no reform whatsoever, stick your head in the sand like an ostrich, hope that everything will just hang together and keep battling away and eventually falling behind the other developed countries in the world.</para><para>This government was not prepared to do that. It was not prepared to let the other countries in the developed world get a significant advantage over us.

This government was concerned to make sure that we become as competitive as we possibly can, and we have. We will continue to do so with the introduction of the new tax system next year, when all of those people who are producing goods for export will be able to take advantage of the tax system that this government was prepared to put to the Australian people. It was prepared to put it into practice and it has.</para><para>This bill is providing some amendments in order to finetune the package because of representations that have been made to us.

The government keep saying that we allegedly were the only ones that had a wholesale sales tax while everybody else had a VAT. I had an interesting conversation with the United States congressional delegation which was out this week. They only levy their tax once. The point was made to me by a congressman that you do that so that it makes thing more simple. If you only levy a tax at one stage, the administration is more simple and it is more readily identifiable, instead of happening at every stage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am sorry Senator Heffernan has left the chamber tonight, because the issue I want to concentrate on is how the payments to wheat producers from the Australian Wheat Board are going to be handled.

It is very serious. There is a problem for these primary producers because it borders on whether their product is actually being exported.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We had Senator Ferguson tell us that taxes on inputs will be removed for those crops and those products that are exported. Let me use a current example. In New South Wales, and I guess in other states, it is the beginning of the wheat harvest time. In the north-west, in some areasâin fact in Mr Anderson's electorateâthey have had a lot of rain. The crop has 
 been downgraded in a number of parts to being fit only for stockfeed wheat.</para><para>I am not aware of stockfeed wheat being in any demand on the export market. It is usually sold off at about $80 a tonne as opposed to $160 a tonneâthose sorts of comparative figuresâon the domestic market. From my reading of the answer that I have received and from Senator Ferguson's comment, for any wheat that goes overseas that is prime hard growers are going to receive premium paymentsâbe paid wellâand be able to claim the taxes off their inputs and not pay them. But those primary producers whose wheat is weather affected and is classified as stock wheat only and therefore is not able to be exported will have to pay the GST.</para><para>Not only will they then be getting less money for their product; they will be having to pay more for their input costs than those who are able to produce for export. It is sheer luck as to whether a storm may have hit their crop and the neighbour's crop might not have got that rain. You could well have, in adjoining paddocks almost, one crop being affected and another one not. The affected crop could well end up getting a lower price to the farmer, but he will not be able to claim his inputs as tax deductions, as opposed to the chap or woman who gets the better cropâgets an export cropâand is able to get a higher price and also claim the tax deductions for their inputs. That does not strike me as being fair. I am led to believe that that is correct, because part of the answer says:</para><para>Export sales of wheat by the AWB will be GST free and domestic sales will be subject to the GST. Therefore, the AWB will have to account separately for these sales.</para><para>What is not clear to me is what the implications are to the AWB for their running costs, but it is very clear to me that there are some potential stings in the tail here for primary producers. When we get to the committee stage, I would certainly like that question to be answered.</para><para>Getting back to the answer to my question (1), about outlining the arrangements for loan payments, it said:</para><para>Where a loan arrangement is entered into with, amongst other things, loan repayments and interest 
 charges with commercial terms, details of conditions in the event of loan default, risks borne by the lender and a genuine expectation of repayment, no GST will be applicable to the loan principal and no GST is payable on interest charges. However, the supply of the loan facility by the AWB itself will be input taxed as a financial supply.</para><para>That obviously has some implications for grain producers. Later I asked whether these sorts of situations would apply to producers of other grains. The answer was: `See (1).' It then said:</para><para>Where a genuine loan agreement is entered into with a producer, a liability for GST on the supply of the wheat will arise either at the time the producer is paid or issues an invoice for their wheat, depending on whether the producer accounts on a cash or non-cash basis.</para><para>First of all, when we get to the committee stage, I would like all that interpreted into English that is plain and simple, so I can understand it and so that I can send it out to my wheat producers.</para><para>The reason for these questions going on notice was that I was asked these questions by grain producers. They, it is obvious, are quite concerned and quite unsure of what the situation is. In answer (2) we are told:</para><para>If the AWB sells wheat directly to a non resident customer and actually exports the wheat, the supply will be GST free. The conditions which must be met to make a GST free export are that the goods are exported from Australia by the supplier within 60 days of the supplier receiving any consideration or issuing an invoice for the goods (whichever occurs first).</para><para>I would like that also in plain English, but I would also like the Department of the Treasury to tell me, if they can, how much wheat is sold in such a situation that there is less than 60 days eventuating from the export where the supplier has received any consideration or issues an invoice for the goods. These are pertinent questions which were not answered in the answer that I got. For other grains I was told to see answer (1). The final answer says:</para><para>Broadly, primary producers and agricultural marketing boards will have the same responsibilities as all other GST registered businesses. Each entity will have to apply for an Australian Business Number to be registered for the GST. After 1 July 2000 GST will have to be remitted for taxable supplies made in the course of their business. An input tax 
 credit will be allowed for GST paid on creditable business acquisitions. Regular returns called Business Activity Statements will need to be completed and lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (quarterly or monthly). A net payment of GST will have to be made at the same intervals. Where a business has paid out more GST than has been collected then the ATO will refund the amount within 14 days of the lodgement of the return.</para><para>As I said, I want all of that put into plain English, because it is not in plain English at present.</para><para>I want to go back to the beginning in terms of the loan payments or the payments by the AWB to wheat producers. My understanding is that when these payments are made they do not get a single payment but that payments are made over two or three pools, as they are called. The bulk comes through first and then after the wheat sale has been finalised more will come through in maybe one or two different lots. It is of course possible that for this year's wheat harvest the pools will not be finalised until after 1 July 2002âthat is, after the introduction of the GST. I want to know what transition arrangements have been put into place for the GST for farmers who actually are getting paid for the crop that they harvested this year and for the work that they put in for this year. This is not clear.</para><para>I also want to know from the department and from the minister how they are going to work out which farmers have had their grain exported, or is it going to be done on the basis of a collective allocation or assessment? A truck load of wheat is made up of many grains. The farmer will have some idea, when he takes his wheat to the silo, of its grading. The wheat is put into different grades; part of it may end up being exported, but part of it may be used domestically. How is how much a particular grower has contributed to a particular pool going to be assessed? How is the assessment going to be done so that we know that allâor maybe only partâof grower X's crop went overseas? No-one knows, because it is made up of individual grains and they are all pooled.</para><para>Presumably an assessment will be done and a pro rata applied. For example, if 50 per cent of one particular category gets exported and 
 somebody has 100 tonnes of that particular grade, then they will get 50 per cent notionally allocated to them as having been exported, and for that 50 per cent they will be able to claim their input taxes back. For the other 50 per cent they will not. This has some severe ramifications, because that will lead to higher prices in terms of value addingâor disincentives to value adding. If a farmer is lucky enough to have all of a particular pool exported, they will get all their inputs removed. But if it goes to some value adding within Australia, which might eventually end up being exported, the farmers are not going to be able to recoup the tax on their inputs.</para><para>I come from the central west of New South Wales. We have Uncle Ben's and Friskies. They are two pet food providers, and a large part of the base for pet foods is cerealsâwheat, barley, et cetera. A lot of their product for dogs and cats ends up on the shelves of supermarkets in Japan and other countries overseas. Are Treasury telling me that they will be able to work it all the way back and calculate the percentage of the grain the Wheat Board sells to Uncle Ben's and Friskiesâsay 100 tonnes made up into 100 tonnes of pet food, of which 50 tonnes goes overseasâso that Uncle Ben's gets the benefit, the Wheat Board gets the benefit and the farmers get the benefit? If they are telling me that, then it sounds like an extremely difficult and time consuming paper trail.</para><para>I do not think primary producers will want to be involved in that sort of thing. I do not think primary producers realise just how confusing this particular issue is. I have grave concerns because I do not know just how the government are going to be able to explain that. From the reading of the answer that I have been given, it strikes me that there are still some answers to be had on this. We are now only seven months away from the introduction of this tax. Grain producers and other farmers are planning not just for this season's crop but for next year and the following years. How can they plan with any certainty? How can banks and lending institutions lend them money with any certainty when they know that any export sales of wheat will be GST free and domestic sales will be subject 
 to GST? It does not affect just the farmers in this region; it affects the whole region. If there is less income and more paperwork to be done, the farmers will not be spending as much money in the communities and the town. This is another example of where this tax would appear to be more iniquitous.</para><para>When we come to the committee stage of the debate on this bill, there are a lot of questions I want answers to, and I want answers in plain English so that the wheat producers that are asking me these questions can have the answers they want in language they can understand. This answer is not given in language they can understand. It also took 39 days to come. I would have thought that, so close to the introduction of this bill, the department and the minister would have been able to almost pull the answer off the shelf and have a one-day turnaround in answering. But they did not; it has taken 39 days. That is indicative of the unprepared state the government are in as they attempt to introduce this piece of iniquitous legislation that is impacting on the whole community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>11254</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support these government bills, the <inline ref="r866">A New Tax System (Pay As You Go) Bill 1999</inline>  and three related bills, which are about amending and tidying up the key bills which went through this parliament in June about the new tax system. Why are we here talking about tax? The fundamental reason we are talking about tax is that Australians know that the Australian tax system has been an absolute mess for a long, long time. It was designed in the 1930s when the Australian economy was based on goods and not services. Back in the 1930s, about two-thirds of the Australian economy, as in most Western world economies, was goods and about a third was services. Today the reverse applies: two-thirds or more of the Australian economy and of most of the Western world's economies is services and about a third is goods, and it is shifting rapidly to services. That is what people are spending their money on. So the system that was designed back in the 1930s, a long time ago, is basically out of date. Not only that, we had a process since the 1930s of adding complexity to a system which was 
 not based on principles. So we built up this superstructure of complicated tax in Australia, and we have ended up with one of the most complicated tax structures in the world.</para></talk.start><para>Both sides of politics have known this for a long time. The Asprey committee reported in the mid-1970s about what a mess the Australian tax system was and how it needed to be changed. The Hawke government in 1986 came to the same conclusion, but unfortunately politics between the ACTU and the Prime Minister of the day defeated Mr Keating and option C went out the window. Instead of going ahead with what was needed by the Australian economy and what was needed by our children and our grandchildren for the future, it was thrown out the door for short-term politics. Fightback in 1993 was the next major attempt, by our side of politics, to get the situation right, but again unfortunately scare tactics led to the defeat of the coalition's proposals in 1993.</para><para>It took John Howard to have the courage to set the record straight. In August two years ago he said, `This government has the guts to take on board tax reform and change the tax system for Australiaânot for us for today or tomorrow but for our kids and our grandkids for the future.' Everyone who knew anything about tax recognised that this had to be done. From that day back in August 1997, the coalition has been through this long process of tax reform. I had the honour of being chairman of the Prime Minister's tax task force, which was seeking views from the community for seven months about what was wrong with the tax system and what needed to be changed. The government considered those views, came out with this package and went to the election on it, followed by a Senate select committee on the ANTS package and then Ralph and business tax. So Australia now has a modern tax system before us, and what we are talking about today is minor amendments to tidy up the ANTS bills as a result of consultation with industries about the detailâjust a normal, sensible process of consultation with the various interest groups and getting the fine detail right. The principles have been set right. They have been set in legislation and they are now 
 law. What we are about today is setting the detail and getting that right.</para><para>In spite of all this, we have the opposition continuing with the lie that this is all nonsense, that the GST is nonsense, when in their hearts their leaders know that tax reform was required in Australia. Their leaders took part in the debates and led the debates in the 1980s requiring those changes, but they have left all that behind because they want to go ahead with short-term scare politics with the Australian community. That is very sad for our children and our grandchildren. Even though the opposition woke up in the last couple of weeksâand thank goodness they did wake up and agreed to the Ralph changes on business tax going throughâit is time that they also woke up and agreed to the GST changes going through so that Australia does end up with a sensible, practical, modern tax system fitting in with the rest of the world. They want to stay with wholesale sales tax. They want to put us back into the category of Botswana and three other Third World countries, in contrast with anyone else in the rest of the world.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>11255</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I joined the treaties committee when I first entered the Senate and believe that today it is one of parliament's most important committees. It does not have a very long history, having been established a little over three years ago, but it fulfils a very important and a very crucial role. The committee provides a voice for parliament and a voice for the community in developing international law. It is a voice that the people of Australia have been demanding for a very long time.</para></talk.start><para>Many people think that international law is an esoteric matter with little bearing on the way we lead our lives here in Australia, but this is not so. Increasingly, as the international community grows and matures, more and more aspects of our daily lives and our interactions with others are governed by internationally developed rules and norms of conduct. Whether it is in the field of defence and security, nuclear disarmament, trade and investment, the environment, civil aviation, social security and health services, science and technology or human rights, international agreements affect us all.</para><para>While some mistakenly see treaties as of little importance in everyday life, some others equally mistakenly go to the other extreme and ascribe far too muchâoften sinisterâinfluence to international treaties that bind this country. In a rapidly changing world, the extent to which domestic policy options are limited by our international obligationsâby our treatiesâcan be a source of concern for some people in our community. Some people fear that treaties unduly infringe on our rights and on our national sovereignty.</para><para>Recent protests on the streets of Seattleâagainst free trade and globalisation in general and the activities of the World Trade Organisation in particularâare a reminder to governments of the need to subject international agreements to close scrutiny. In the absence of public input, international organisations far too readily become the focal points for alleged conspiracies and plots by special interests and unaccountable bureaucrats. In my view, in a civilised global society the advantages of international agreements far outweigh any potential disadvantages: treaties can help to establish fair, agreed and transparent rules to guide the relations between nations.</para><para>But Australia's entry into international treaties goes much further than simply being a good international citizen. Treaty making is not a matter of altruism: this country negotiates treaties because it is in our national interest to do so. Nations with relatively small populations, such as Australia, benefit greatly from a world where relations between countries are based upon agreement and not aggression. If the rules of international engagement 
 were to be governed simply by the projection of military and economic power, Australia would be at a distinct disadvantage. But in a world where international relations are based upon effective rules, our country can have an influence that extends beyond what our military and economic strength might suggest. Already Australia has advanced her national objectives by helping to shape the standards and the rules by which international relations are conducted. A recent example is the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, which establishes globally accepted regimes for access to the resources of the sea and the seabed.</para><para>Australia is one of the world's very great trading nations but, because of our relatively isolated geographical position, we are heavily reliant upon efficient transport and communications systems. The treaties establishing the much maligned World Trade Organisation assist Australian industries in developing global markets. Without international cooperation of this sort, Australia's standard of living and our quality of life would suffer. For example, treaties can help communities around the world tackle environmental problems that cross national borders and require coordinated international action to resolve. Treaties can help establish fair taxation regimes for small Australian export firms seeking to trade in international markets. Treaties can help ensure that international air services meet minimum safety standards and that Australian travellers who fall ill while overseas have access to local health care services. Treaties can also help establish agreed plant and animal quarantine standards.</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is part of Australia's response to this challenge of ensuring that global rule making reflects, and is responsive to, local concerns. In its work it operates in the best tradition of parliamentary committees: it is objective and inquiring and it recognises that the commitment to Australia's national interest is far more important than considerations of partisanship. Since 1996 the treaties committee has tabled in parliament 28 reports reviewing 160 separate treaty actions. Since July this year, when I joined the committee, we have pro 
 duced six reports reviewing 26 treaty actions. Not only is it a prolific committee but I believe it is an extremely effective one.</para><para>Our terms of reference provide that all proposed international treaties be reviewed by the treaties committee before action is taken by this government to bind Australia to the terms of the treaty. In short, we expose all treaty actions to the bright light of public examination. The questions we ask in our reviews are generally very straightforward. Why is this treaty action being proposed? What obligations, costs and benefits will be associated with this treaty action? What other government and community groups have been involved in the development of this treaty? These questions are directed at gathering sufficient information to allow us to determine whether or not the treaty or proposed treaty action is in Australia's national interest.</para><para>In doing so, we gratefully acknowledge the assistance we are given by the submissions we receive from members of the public, community organisations and state and territory governments. A good example comes from my home state of Queensland. Last month the treaties committee travelled to Rockhampton to talk to the local community about their views on a proposed treaty allowing the Singapore Armed Forces to use the defence training area at Shoalwater Bay. Although we have not yet reported to parliament on this treaty, I can say that we found it to be extremely useful to speak to representatives of the local community, government, business and environmental groups about the impact of the proposed treaty.</para><para>Australia is changing dramatically in economic and social terms along with the rest of the world. The changes are driven primarily by new technology which has the potential to dramatically increase the productivity, the wealth and the quality of life of the Australian community. Australia cannot opt out of these developments nor opt out of the international system that seeks to make rules for orderly progress. Rather, we must try to influence developments in order to protect and promote our national interest. The echoes of Seattle convince me that our role in this parliament is to explain to Australiansâand perhaps 
 othersâwhy international agreements serve our interests.</para><para>It is about leadership. While we cannot tell people who have concerns about a changing world and about the pace of globalisation that their concerns have no validity, neither can we merely echo and massage the ill-informed fears that Australia can somehow opt out. In a way, the treaties committee simply seeks to ensure that international agreements to which Australia might become a party benefit the national interest. We want to ensure that the strengthening of economic, social and cultural ties between Australia and other countriesâcall it globalisation if you wishâare the bonds of benefit and not the shackles of subservience. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Class G Airspace Trial</title><page.no>11257</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>11257</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe report of the class G airspace trial recently released by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, and tabled in this place was indeed a damning document. It was a matter that I pursued at some length in last week's estimates hearings, and this evening I wish to make further comment on the report and evidence from those hearings.</para></talk.start><para>It was clear from the evidence provided by a number of senior officers from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, Airservices Australia and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that Airservices remains responsible in law for airspace design. It was also clear from the evidence that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority was keen to take over that role. That was certainly the case when Mr Dick Smith was the chair of CASA. I assume it is still the case. As senators are aware, the class G airspace trial conducted by CASA at the end of last year was a complete disaster. According to the ATSB, there were 154 occurrence notifications received by the then Bureau of Air Safety Investigations relating to airspace procedures in the demonstration area or associated with the trial. CASA was forced to close down the trial prematurely on safety grounds. </para><para>During last week's hearings, I asked the deputy secretary of the transport department, Mr Harris, on what legal basis CASA was able to conduct the trial. He said that CASA could make changes to airspace management for safety reasons but acknowledged that Airservices Australia was responsible for making changes to airspace design. However, the original Airservices Australia safety case relating to changes in airspace management concluded that the new system was not designed to be safer than the old system.</para><para>In fact, a document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Summary of responses to (NPRM) 9702RP</inline>, which related to radio requirements for class G airspace and was published by CASA in January this year, stated that change to class G airspace was designed to improve traffic information and to review third-party directed traffic information services with `substantial cost benefit to industry if change could be achieved safely'. The reality was that the airspace changes were far more about cutting costs than enhancing safety. The action of CASA in taking control of the trial can therefore not be accommodated in even the most liberal interpretation of the authority's responsibilities as defined in the Civil Aviation Act.</para><para>In the estimates, I asked Mr Harris whether the former transport minister, Mr Vaile, or his senior adviser was made aware that the transfer of airspace management from Airservices Australia to CASA required legislative change. Mr Harris replied, `Yes. Definitely, they would have been.' But Mr Harris was not sure whether that advice went directly to the minister or was provided through his adviser. In fact, there was legal advice on this very point provided by the Government Solicitor to the department in January last year. However, it is unclear when that advice went to Mr Vaile and to Mr Anderson. Similar legal advice would also have been provided to Mr Vaile in March last year as part of the report on the restructuring of Airservices Australia.</para><para>Mr Harris also confirmed for the committee that Mr Vaile and his senior adviser were both briefed on 28 May last year of CASA's decision to proceed with the class G trial. He confirmed that there was no ministerial 
 direction to CASA to take over functional responsibility for airspace. In fact, I understand the minister was not able, legally, to give such a direction. I also checked the legality of CASA's decision to take over the airspace trial with Mr Pollard, the Chief Executive Officer of Airservices Australia. I asked:</para><para>Is it your understanding that, under the current legislation, Airservices Australia remains responsible, in law, for airspace design and changes?</para><para>He said:</para><para>Yes, sir.</para><para>Mr Pollard also said that authority for the management of airspace could not be delegated to CASA.</para><para>This evidence was confirmed by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau report on the class G trial. According to the ATSB, despite no legislative changes occurring, CASA had taken control of the development, management and implementation of airspace reform. The ATSB found no document that provided a direction or instruction to CASA to take control of airspace issues. Indeed, senior management officers confirmed to the bureau that the government had made no decision to transfer this power to CASA. I asked Mr Harris of the department about a reference in the ATSB report that stated:</para><para>Departmental officers indicated that the Department's view in early 1998 was that CASA had much work to do before it could take over responsibility for airspace.</para><para>Mr Harris said that this statement related to available resources but acknowledged that it was probably related also to the fact that, at that point, CASA was not properly prepared to undertake the trial. That point appeared to be confirmed by an answer to a question taken on notice in the February 1999 estimates. That answer advised that CASA did not undertake any risk modelling or quantitative risk analysis prior to the class G airspace demonstration. I asked Mr Harris whether the minister was briefed on the fact that CASA was both under-resourced and underprepared to run the trial and, soon after, the fact that CASA planned to proceed with the class G trial anyway.</para><para>Senator Macdonald, in his ever helpful way, jumped in and confirmed that the ministersâI 
 assume, Mr Vaile and then Mr Andersonâwere both properly briefed. I assume that was a clear yes. So we had a situation where an authority took control of the management and change in Australian airspace with no proper legal authority and without the resources or the skills required to do the job. We had the illegality of that action certainly known to Mr Vaile and his senior adviser, and I am confident that a similar brief would have been made available to the incoming minister, Mr Anderson.</para><para> We had both Mr Vaile and Mr Anderson also being briefed on the intention of CASA to run the class G trial. It appears that Mr Vaile, or at least his senior adviser, actually encouraged CASA to do so. Mr Anderson did nothing to stop CASA proceeding with the trial despite the fact that he had advice that it was outside that agency's legal charter. So CASA was well aware of the illegality of taking over airspace management as early as January last year. I understand that legal advice on that point was also put before the CASA board in March last year as part of a task force report on the issue of airspace management.</para><para> I understand that the CASA board noted in November last year that there were still outstanding legal issues that needed to be resolved in relation to the transfer of airspace management. At the time of that advice the class G trial had already commenced, so it is now clear that CASA acted well beyond its legislative authority in running the trial. It should also be noted that CASA placed itself in a conflict of interest situation: it was both the advocate of the proposed changes to airspace management and the safety regulator in relation to that change. I would have thought that the consequences, both for the authority and for the government, of this illegal action would have been to the forefront of the minds of both Mr Vaile and Mr Anderson.</para><para> As I understand it, under the law all government statutory authorities can be sued, either under common law for negligence or, alternatively, for failure to carry out their statutory duties. I would have thought that Mr Vaile and certainly Mr Anderson, given the 
 advice they had from their departments, would have been aware that CASA could be considered negligent if there was an accident by breaching its duty of care to ensure that safety aspects of the class G trial were up to scratch. It is hard to see how there would be a case for government immunity in such a situation.</para><para> It is important not to forget that this question while now theoretical was almost a reality on two occasions during the trial. According to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, on 16 November last year the crew of a BAe Jetstream were maintaining the aircraft at 5,000 feet for separation from a descending Beechcraft King Air. The sector controller transmitted radar information on the Jetstream to the pilot of the King Air. This information was not acknowledged by the King Air pilot and was subsequently reported to have been overtransmitted by another pilot. The King Air was observed on radar to descend through the level of the Jetstream. The two aircraft passed each other with approximately 600 feet of vertical separation and 0.5 nautical miles horizontal displacement. That is a near miss in anyone's language. There was a second incident involving a Beechcraft King Air and a Saab 340. According to BASI, in both of these incidents, prior to the class G airspace demonstration, the crews would have been alerted to each other's existence through the provision of directed traffic information.</para><para> So the CASA board knew that it did not have the power to do what it was doing. In doing so it created an unsafe situation. Mr Vaile and Mr Anderson also knew that CASA did not have the legal power to run the trial and, therefore, both failed to meet their responsibilities to ensure that the aviation industry had a safe environment in which to operate. This is yet another black mark for the transport minister. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>World Trade Organisation: 3rd Ministerial Conference</title><title>Online Australia Day</title><page.no>11259</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>11259</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening 
 to talk about the events of the past week in Seattle and the lessons for the future arising from that. If time permits, I will also talk about IT. The 3rd World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference certainly brought globalisation onto the streets and our television screens. For the first time, instead of the traditional smiling line-ups of world leaders, civil action managed to change the agenda of one of the world's most powerful organisations. Far more people now know about the WTO and its potential to affect their lives and of the way globalisation has moved from the removal of tariff barriers in the international marketplace to more insidious means of championing the expansion of global capital.</para></talk.start><para> The failure of the talks in Seattle to launch a further round of negotiations presents international leaders with an opportunity to reassess the pace and direction of trade liberalisation. It is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that there must be a review of the effect of the Uruguay Round reforms on international trade, the developing world and the implementation and enforcement of international standards pertaining to human rights, to workers, to social rights and to the environment. The demonstrations in Seattle proved that the mantra of the inevitability of globalisation, chanted by some governments across the world, is insufficient explanation for the haste with which it has been embraced.</para><para> The failure of these talks to lead to a further round of liberalisation negotiations has given the international community and its citizens the opportunity to further question their governments about the pace and effect of liberalisation and to assess the consequences of past liberalisation and reform, particularly on developing nations. There is a world of difference between the removal of tariffs and the prohibition of domestic standards protecting health, the environment and children's rights. This is the future agenda of international trade liberalisation.</para><para> The WTO suffers from a number of intrinsic flaws which make it increasingly unacceptable to citizens around the world. Foremost among these is the degree to which the WTO prioritises free trade and commercial 
 considerations above all other values. WTO rules generally require domestic laws, rules and regulations designed to further the protection of non-commercial interests to be undertaken in the `least trade restrictive' manner possible. It is very difficult to uncover instances where trade is subject to non-commercial considerations. Workers', consumers', environmental, health, safety, human rights and animal protections nearly always come off second-best. The prioritisation of trade, coupled with the WTO's extraordinary powers of enforcement, means that contrary to its rhetoric it actively promotes, not just regulates, trade. Its rules are biased to facilitate global commerce at the expense of efforts to promote local economic development and policies that move communities, countries and regions in the direction of greater self-reliance.</para><para> The WTO also undermines democracy by drastically restricting the choices available to democratically controlled governments, with violations of WTO rules attracting potentially severe penalties. These inflexible rules determine how economies should be organised and corporations controlled. The WTO enforces a trade regime detrimental to the interests of developing nations by forcing them to open their markets to foreign multinationals, leaving fledgling domestic industries vulnerable to foreign competition and dumping. In agriculture, the opening to foreign imports proposed by the WTO has the potential to cause a massive social dislocation of millions of rural people.</para><para> The WTO operates against the application of the precautionary principle. WTO rules generally block countries from acting in response to potential risk, requiring probability before governments can move to resolve harms to human health or, say, the environment. It threatens diversity by establishing international health, environmental and other standards as a global ceiling through a process of `harmonisation', exceptions to which are quite difficult to obtain.</para><para>It operates in an opaque fashion, applying stringent rules and making decisions which affect millions of people behind closed doors and without the input of those people who 
 will be affected by the decisions. It limits the potential of governments to use procurement in the furtherance of human rights, environmental or workers' rights, or for other non-commercial purposes. By stipulating that governments may make purchases based only on quality and cost considerations, the WTO ensures that the neo-liberal agenda operates to the detriment of populations which expect certain levels of support and protection from their elected governments.</para><para>The Australian Democrats endorse the following proposals for future action on international trade liberalisation. Firstly, the Australian Democrats endorse not just free trade but fair and ethical trade. Unjust enrichment of the wealthiest nations and corporations should not be part of the international trade agenda. Secondly, we endorse the examination of trade and its consequences. Trade is intrinsically linked to the environment, human rights and labour standards, and reform or liberalisation proposals must be considered within this context. There must be ongoing dialogue between international institutions, designed to implement international standards relating to the environment, human rights, social rights and the WTO.</para><para>The power of the WTO to invalidate laws passed pursuant to international agreements must be revoked. Following on from this is the necessary recognition that trade is only one aspect of business and business is only one aspect of life, and neither should subjugate other values. Clearly, there must be a balance.</para><para>There must be transparency in the international trade regime. The demonstrations were a clear indication that people are not satisfied with WTO's current policy. The WTO and the Australian trade minister must make WTO documents available for public scrutiny. It is not enough to merely inform people what is happening; there must be democracy as well, with communities able to influence decisions made at the WTO.</para><para>In the time remaining, I wish to refer to the fact that 26 November this year was Australia's second Online Australia Day. I would like to acknowledge and congratulate all those who were involved in that day. I 
 especially wish to congratulate the ABC for their extensive involvement, which was certainly one of the highlights of the day. Roger Clarke, a consultant who is well known to many members of the Australian Internet community, prepared a short `state of the e-nation' address for Online Australia Day, which I will draw on quite heavily. The document outlines his view of this government's progress on a number of technology and information economy issues, and the view he has painted is a little distressing. The Democrats share many of his concerns, and I will run through some of them.</para><para>Firstly, the  Electronic Transactions Bill 1999 , which was debated in this place during the current sittings, was not only overdue but it may not provide the level of certainty that is required in that area. In particular, I reiterate the concerns which I put during the debate about the need to extend the framework to all Australian jurisdictions and all transactions.</para><para>We are still waiting for legislation to ensure private sector privacy. This privacy protection is long overdue and is a crucial component in establishing public confidence in electronic commerce. The key government public authority has failed to include a range of privacy protections in the public key infrastructure model which has been adopted. This is likely to be a significant impediment to the adoption of the model.</para><para>Encryption policy requires a major overhaul to ensure unrestricted access to tools which can ensure some degree of communications privacy. Most people would baulk at the idea of sending their credit card number on a postcard, but we live with insecure communications every day on the Internet. International connectivity remains inadequate. Despite frequent suggestions that Australia should play a major role in financial and information services in this region, there are few direct data connections between Australia and Asia, and currently they are simply not adequate.</para><para>The pricing of connectivity in Australia is extraordinarily high when compared with our major competitors. Charges are around 300 per cent greater in Australia than in the USA or Canada, for example. ISDN data services are still extremely expensive, even though off- 
the-shelf modems are now available which offer almost the same capacity. Cable is available to around two million, mostly affluent, people, but Internet access via cable is still not priced at an affordable level.</para><para>I have certainly taken some liberties with Roger's list. I have a few more that I could add, but time is against me. The general pattern here is obvious. The government makes louder and louder noises about their successes in relation to the information economy and information technology, but not enough has been done to back up the marketing rhetoric. I should also point out that Internet censorship, the government's unworkable and undesirable legislation, also came under attack and criticism. I think Clarke referred to it as a misguided attempt to control content on the Internet. With this legislation, the government has ignored expert advice, the wishes of the community, and the evidence of failed past attempts around the world. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Day of People with a Disability</title><page.no>11261</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>11261</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn 3 December this year we celebrated International Day of People with a Disability. As this is the first opportunity I have had since that day, I thought it appropriate to mention a scheme that I have recently become involved with. It involves a family with a disabled member adopting a politicianâcommonly called `Adopt a Pollie'. The scheme is administered by the Disability Development Council of Western Australia, and it is designed to give an insight into the impact on a family when one member of the family is disabled. The scheme provides for first-hand contact between the member of parliament and the adopting person and their family. It allows the member of parliament to investigate assistance which would make life easier for the family and the person concerned, and it provides an opportunity to visit disability service providers and to get in touch with other people with disabilities and experience their needs.</para></talk.start><para>I have had the privilege of being adopted by Stephen Franklin, a delightful young man 
 in his early 20s with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Stephen, who lives at home with his father Norm, his mother Carol and his sister Kristy, is confined to a wheelchair and requires constant care and attention. It has indeed been a privilege to be invited into their home to see how they cope with Stephen's day-to-day needs. At the recent adoption ceremony, it was somewhat moving to hear what Stephen's mother Carol had to say. At that adoption ceremony, she said:</para><para>My life began the same as many and for all my early years my life seemed to take the path of the innermost band of the rainbow. I could see the pot of gold at the end. I was married, had a career and one lovely child. A few years later my life took an unexpected turn, with the birth of my second child Stephen. With his birth, my life took a new path. I could still see the pot of gold but it seemed a bit further away. It was as if I had stepped from the red band onto the orange.</para><para>As Stephen grew up, the pot of gold seemed to be getting further away and I seemed to be stepping across all the colours of the rainbow, from orange to yellow to green and so on. It seemed impossible for me, let alone Stephen to reach the pot of gold. Then almost eight years ago a Local Area Coordinator asked me to think of what we could see in the future for our son. We had difficulty picturing that pot of gold for Stephen. Then we asked what the future held for our other two children. We then realised that Stephen had a pot of gold too. He would just need some assistance to get there.</para><para>So we began to plan for Stephen to reach the pot of gold and he began to move toward the inner bands and his path seemed to be lessening. But several times along the way doors began to shut and again he seemed to be moving outward and backward.</para><para>When the opportunity was given to our family to adopt a politician, we took it with great hope. It was a chance for us to show that person that our family just wanted what other families take for granted.</para><para>It is our hope through this scheme that we all can raise the awareness of politicians to help every disabled child reach that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</para><para>I think those words are somewhat telling, and I would use them in recommending this scheme to other members of parliament. In my home state of Western Australia, there are a number of state and federal politicians from across the political spectrum who have become involved in this scheme. It is a scheme 
 which places a member of parliament in touch with the reality of the problems faced by the people who are experiencing them. With the contact that I have had with Stephen and his family, it has certainly been an eye-opener for me.</para><para>Some people perhaps approach this with some trepidation. I know that my association with people with disabilities prior to this had been minimal. It is for that reason that I would urge my colleagues across the political spectrum to become involved with this program. It is a thoroughly worthwhile program. I want to acknowledge the efforts of Liz Pretsel from that council, who is absolutely unswerving in her efforts to get politicians adopted. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Stephen Franklin and his delightful family for adopting me and bringing me into their home to see the challenges that lie ahead for them. I only hope that I can use my position to assist them to meet those challenges.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Republic Referendum: Youth</title><page.no>11262</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>11262</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor many young Australians the change to a republic on 6 November would have represented the belated formal acknowledgment of our unique cultural identity. Young Australians who, like me, still feel strongly that the only sensible next step for Australia is to become a republic will continue to work towards the next chance to make our Constitution truly Australian.</para></talk.start><para>No-one can deny that the future belongs to youthâit does by definition. This holds true with respect to the republic as wellâgiving young people an even greater stake in the outcome than mere numbers would imply. However, it is with typical irony that it was young people who appeared to have the least opportunity to participate in the decision to move forward to a republic. You must be 18 and on the electoral roll to vote. If you were younger, you were out of the official picture and you basically had to sit back and cross your fingers and hope that enough people in enough states would see the light and vote yes for a republic when it mattered. The effect this had on young people was twofold. It creates a feeling of cynicism which our 
 younger generation is incredibly susceptible toâI know; I have been there myselfâand it leads to apathy, which is damaging to their present situation and their future as potential community leaders and participants in our community.</para><para>The potential is there for this structural exclusion to turn young people away and to confirm feelings of alienation from what they see as the establishment. However, this structural exclusion can also potentially be the motivation for the most extraordinary campaign to be embarked upon by the youth of a nation. The dedication and commitment that I have witnessed amongst young Australians is profound. The desire to use the republic referendum as an anvil to forge a new direction for Australia, I believe, heralds the beginning of a new civic awareness. Seventy thousand young Australians enrolled to vote for the first time in the November referendum. This figure alone is a ringing endorsement of the desire of young Australians to play a significant role in the determination of the future direction of this country.</para><para>But for those too young too vote, what medium exists for them to have a voice in our direction? How do they make their voices heard in our political system? The Internet is rapidly becoming one of the most important communications media for Australians generally but most importantly for young Australians. With a trending increase in accessibility to the Internet, and if we were to create a more equitable system for Internet access, Australia has the potential to become a highly connected nation. The Net has the capability of overcoming the communication barriers relating to the tyranny of distance which continues to plague and divide us, and it has the potential to facilitate the equal involvement of all Australians, be they from rural, regional or metropolitan areas. Most importantly, it allows Australians of all ages, regardless of differing abilities, to interact with their political representatives in a real time environment.</para><para>The purpose of my Internet site during the republic debate was to provide such a medium for young Australians, for those under 18 years of age. Young people were very much 
 aware during the republic debate that, although they were officially not part of the decision making process, it was they who would inherit the results of this process. I hoped my site would provide an opportunity for those Australians who were too young to vote in the November referendum to express their view on the issue, and it continues to do so on a range of issues.</para><para>An example I would like to refer to to illustrate my point about the role that young people play in our political future and our development as a nation can be found in the conclusions of the Youth and New Technology project, which, although quite dated now, was conducted in Eastern Europe and finished with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Mahler saw the young as having the potential to be the motivators of change, and his study led to the conclusion that universal youth culture was too powerful to be resisted by an authoritarian state. The enabling factor for change was a product of information technologyâthe media.</para><para>Such technological advancement allowed the presentation of common views and aspirations into every home and led a value shift, ultimately resulting in political transformation. No doubt Mahler would have been astounded by the accuracy of his predictions. However, the media revolution taking place at that time in Europe is dwarfed by the convergence of computing, communication and media giants occurring on the cusp of the new millennium. This convergence has produced a common digital language and the Internet represents not just the backbone of global communications but the circulatory and nervous system of the 21st century culture. If the observations of Mahler hold true, there is no reason to think otherwise and the power in the hands of those who can access and utilise the Internet is immense.</para><para>As recently as December 1998, Australian statistics show us that by far it is young Australians who are the most adept at accessing the Internet. While there is no doubt that the tertiary student population is a big part of this with 100 per cent of students gaining access through their institution, the sheer numbers indicate that there is a comfort zone 
 with the Internet among the younger generation that cannot be matched by other age groups. Academic studies and practical experience show us that it is the young who attain and lead with computer literacy with respect to life skills and cultural pursuits. The online world of Internet relay chat, emails, mailing lists and news groups for those with common interests spanning the globe all form part of a world that is relatively inaccessible, let alone understood, by many in older generations.</para><para>Studies conducted on the values and attitudes of citizens online show a level of political awareness beyond that of the general community. A survey conducted by <inline font-style="italic">Wired</inline> magazine went so far as to describe the `netizens', a term they use to describe online citizens, as `discerning, swinging voters with well-developed social consciences'.</para><para>The use of the Internet as a political communication tool has been gaining momentum with each passing election around the globe. It is a tool which can be a powerful instrument in the hands of young Australians.</para><para>The Internet is one of the most inspiring changes on the technology front, not just for its technical feats or even its central position amidst converging media, computing and telecommunications, but for the potential to empower global movements. The Internet is re-setting power relationships. It is a universal medium that will be the circuit-breaker for the frustration and cynicism felt by so many young people. It will give a voice to human rights activists and environmentalists the world over and allow global movements to work cooperatively like never before. The political clout was illustrated recently by two examples; firstly, the defeat of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. This agreement was so complex in its construct, so obscure in its intent and its proponents so inaccessible that there was a real risk of it being adopted before anyone understood it. It was the Internet that broke open its mystique and exposed its agenda.</para><para>The online campaign that led to its defeat traversed international borders and was conducted via email. I received hundreds upon hundred of emails alone from individuals 
 expressing concern. This had a significant impact on drawing my attention to the contents of the MAI and its potential negative impact. Another example is the recent events at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle. We know that the Internet campaign leading up to that event involved organising online for up to 11 months in advance, and the coordination that occurred, despite some of the tragic outcomes, brought together those opposing the agenda of the WTO.</para><para>These two examples of the online community getting its act together to influence political outcomes are worthy lessons. There are many others. If these feelings of frustration are coupled with far more overwhelming feelings of national pride, it should come as no surprise that young people are motivated to establish their own agenda for the future. The republic debate was a tangible way to refocus the political agenda on what comes next, not what has been. I would like to table a graph that shows the results of my online republic referendum survey.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>âFinally, I would like to comment on the role that I believe this online presence plays. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>11264</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>11264</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis evening I would like to make a few comments on the work that is done by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I understand that today in the house a number of speakers have tried to raise the profile of the joint treaties committee. The joint treaties committee is perhaps not as well known as some other committees of this house. It does not always attract attention in the way that estimates committees or some of the legislative review committees do. This is a shame because the treaties committee performs an extremely important task on behalf of parliament. The committee reviews and reports on all new international treaties that the Australian government proposes to enter into. Every time the government indicates that it wants to sign up to a new treaty, be it an extradition treaty, a health services agreement, a quarantine standards treaty or an environmental 
 protection treaty, we examine and report on the fine print of the particular treaty.</para></talk.start><para>Our role is to ensure that the government has considered the costs and benefits of the proposed treaty and that the government has consulted widely in the development and negotiation of the treaty. It is not always glamorous work. Sometimes the subject matter is fairly dry. I challenge anyone but the most ardent accountant to get too excited about double taxation treaties, for example. But we are a watchdog committee, seeking to ensure that the treaty actions proposed by the government are in Australia's national interest. It is important to stress that our reviews are not just an examination by experts behind closed doors. We provide a very real opportunity for interested members of the public to comment on the purpose and effect of the proposed treaty actions.</para><para>Each time the government presents a proposed treaty action to parliament, we advertise the fact that we have the treaty under review. We invite interested members of the public to comment on the purpose and effect of the treaty. We advertise in the national press, on the Internet site and by way of direct mail to people on our mailing list. We often find that the comments we receive from community organisations and members of the public provide a fresh perspective on the issues before us. While these submissions might not always address the niceties of international law, they do reflect personal experiences and concerns. This type of grassroots comment can be extremely valuable to us as we seek to determine whether the government should take action to bind Australia to the terms of the treaty.</para><para>I think many parliamentarians would agree that there is a palpable sense of unease in the Australian community about the extent to which international organisations are making decisions which affect our day-to-day lives. The events in Seattle over the last week have shown that there are many people around the world who feel this way. I share some of these concerns. I agree that international organisations must directly reflect the interests of member states. I agree that these organisations must recognise and respond to the 
 concerns of local communities. I agree that environmental, labour and other social interests must figure at least as highly as economic and business interests.</para><para>However, there is no use pretending that we can wind back the clock. We live in a world where travel is global, where commerce is global. We have heard speakers earlier tonight speak about e-commerce and the trade over the Internet. Communication is now global. Environmental issues are global. In a world like this, we need the assistance of international organisations to help establish international rules to ensure that international travel is safe, that international commerce is fair and socially responsible, that international communication services are available to all and that environmental issues are tackled with collective effort. We need to make sure that this government listens and responds to local concerns, to make sure that government represents local and national interests when it deals in international fora. This requires community engagement at all levels of our political systemâengagement with local government, engagement with state government and engagement with Commonwealth government.</para><para>I know that, at times, government seems remote and unresponsive. But it is only remote and unresponsive if we let it be so. There are ample opportunities for people to become involved or to influence government decision making at all levels. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is one of these opportunities. By contributing to the work of the treaties committee, people can have a direct say in the international agreements that the government enters into on our behalf. If people support a proposed treaty, we want to hear from them. If people oppose a particular treaty, we want to hear from them as well. Some people are concerned that treaties unduly infringe on our rights or sovereignty. I do not believe this. I believe that, by establishing agreed and transparent rules, treaties provide a valuable framework for international relations, thereby enhancing our national interests.</para><para>But to those people who are concerned about the impact of treaties on sovereignty, I 
 say that there is a solution: become involved in the reviews conducted by the treaties committee; check our web site for information about what treaties are being reviewed; get on our mailing list so you can receive copies of all new proposed treaty actions and the national interest analyses that are prepared to explain the purpose, costs and benefits of proposed treaties. Armed with this information, you can help us assess the merits or otherwise of particular treaty actions.</para><para>The value of community contributions was highlighted very effectively during our review of a proposed agreement with Singapore on access to the defence training area at Shoalwater Bay. As part of this review, the committee travelled to Rockhampton, where we inspected the defence training area and met with local government, business and environmental groups to discuss the costs and benefits of the proposed treaty and perhaps the wider impact. These meetings were extremely useful to us, offering a perspective on the issues that would not have been available had the community not taken the time to make submissions to us. We are now far better placed to make sensible recommendations on the proposed agreement than we would otherwise have been.</para><para>I conclude by urging all Queenslanders, indeed all Australians, to take an interest in treaties. I cannot promise that we will always agree with the representations we receive. But the treaties committee provides an opportunity for local voices to be heard on the national stage. I also thank the secretariat for its hard work in making the committee function in a well-oiled manner.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.43 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>11266</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>11266</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Airports ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 1999 Nos 290 and 291.</para><para>Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry ActâAustralian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Export of Cattle) Amendment Order 1999 (No. LC1/99).</para><para>Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 1999 No. 294.
