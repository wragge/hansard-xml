The motion is in relation to the confusion that occurred during the debate last night. Most of the attention yesterday was in relation to the <inline ref="r637">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> , but the <inline ref="r636">Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998</inline> , a bill relating to the services of Telstra, was also in there. On the night, there was a lot of confusion about the amendments. I asked about the running sheet and about continuing without knowing exactly the relevance of the particular amendments we were voting on.</para><para>I believe that the will of the Senate was not necessarily done last night because, on reflection, there was at least one amendment which indicated that the vote would have gone another way if it had not been put through in such a rushed process. Under standing order 104, I simply ask that government amendments Nos 5 and 39 from the  Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998  be recommitted. The bill has not yet gone to the House of Representatives. Although we deal with lots of issues hereâand there are many issues which other people believe are more importantâthis is one of those areas where we would like to think that Senate processes had been per 
 formed correctly and that the proper outcome had come from the will of the Senate.</para><para>This is one of those occasions when, if more of us had had the information in front of us, we may well have called a division. A division was not called and I believe that had it been called it would have gone in a different direction than was recorded last night.</para><para>I ask for support on this issue. As I said, there are lots of important issues, and I would like to think that the whole process is such that we will not end up with an outcome which contradicts the will of the Senate. It may well be that decisions are being made which mean that votes are with the government but, if it is the case that the will of the Senate has not been abided by, I think it deserves recommittal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>5893</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government will not agree to the suspension. With all respect to Senator Margetts, if she were serious about this matter she would have given us notice of it this morning so that it could be properly investigated. To be told that this was to be moved as we came into the chamber for prayers this afternoon is not a sign that that this is an issue of serious moment. I can only presume that it is another one of the Greens' stuntsâungracious for me to sayâto try to attract attention to their cause, which in this instance is a lost cause. In such circumstance, I see no reason why the suspension should be granted and the matters recommitted. The government will therefore vote accordingly.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>5893</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have heard the contribution of Senator Margetts and Senator Hill's response. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, the approach that the opposition has consistently taken on these sorts of matters is to ensure that, where there has been misadventure, the will of the Senate is reflected in votes on the floor of the chamber. We adopt that principle because in a chamber like thisâwhere no party has a majority and where many votes are closeâany misadventure can lead to a situation where the will of the Senate is not reflected in voting.</para></talk.start><para>I indicate that I am inclined to support the suspension motion on the evidence available. The problem I have with the suspension motion before the chair is this: Senator Margetts has indicated that, as far as she is concerned, she did not vote as she would have intended to because of a series of consequences. I find that difficult to understand in one sense because you will recall that, in relation to the votes on this particular matter, Senator Ray did call this issue to the attention of all the Senate, and he did ask that standing order 195 be applied in this circumstance. The opposition was worried about the confusion that was on the faces of certain senatorsâparticularly the Democrat senators, who nowadays look to the government for guidance, as you know, Senator Margetts, in how they vote.</para><para>Senator Margetts, I accept what you say, that you inadvertently did not vote in support of this motion. The opposition voted no against government amendments Nos 5 and 39. We did not call a division because there were no other voices in voting no to government amendments Nos 5 and 39. Senator Margetts, you have indicated clearlyâand I appreciate thatâthat you would have voted that way if there had been, in your view, more clarity at the time. I think the case would need to be made that not only you but other senators were in that situation. I will listen to what Senator Harradine, who is in the chamber, might say and I would be interested to hear what the view of the representative of the Australian Democrats might be. There would need to be a substantial number of other senators who found themselves in a similar situation to yourself, Senator Margetts, for the case for recommittal to be made.</para><para>I think that is as objective an analysis that I can make on this situation, and that is why I say that I am minded to vote for the suspension to allow briefly for that case to be made. If it is made and it is clear that there would have been a different outcome, then I think it is proper, in accordance with the principles you would know that I have consistently espoused in this chamberâthat is, that the will of the Senate be reflected in votes on the 
 floor of the chamberâthat the opposition support the recommittal. It is not enough to say that you, Senator Margetts, with the opposition voting in a different way would mean that the outcome would be different. The opposition commands 28 votes in this chamber; you are another one, Senator Margetts, but it is not enough. That is the only way I can approach this situation. That is why I indicate to the Senate that the opposition would support a suspensionâand we do not want a long drawn out debate on this; I can assure youâif by the end of the suspension debate that issue of the will of the Senate is not clear. But if it is clear that the will of the Senate would not be any different if the amendments are recommitted, then the opposition will not support an approach that there be a recommittal, and I do not think there is any other reasonable way that the opposition can approach this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5894</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just indicate briefly that the Democrats are of a mind to support Senator Margetts's call for a suspension of standing orders on this issue, despite Senator Faulkner's assertion that the Democrats now look to the government before we decide what we are doing. Once again, the hollowness of that sort of rhetoric is demonstrated by the fact that we will be supporting Senator Margetts on this issue, despite the very cogently argued position put by Senator Hill. I could say that I was swayed by the arguments of Senator Faulkner but, again, I think that would sound fairly fatuous, given the quality of them.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Margetts has outlined the confusion, and all of us who were here last night would be aware of it, that specifically applied to the amendments that she has drawn attention to. In that context, I think it is important that the vote of the Senate recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> clearly reflects the position of all senators in this place. Whether we end up with a different outcome or not is something that we will find out if we get the chance to recommit the amendments to a vote. We think it is important that the position of the various parties on that vote is on the public record. It is clearly indicated that there was some 
 confusion amongst some senators about what the vote was to be, and that is the purpose of Senator Margetts's aims in trying to get this recommitted. We support her in her aim.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>5895</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Faulkner is right in that a recommittal is warranted if in the course of the debate it appears as though a vote has gone the wrong way.

My recollection of events is that, as the telephone sex amendment was discussed, the opposition moved an amendment. It indicated that it treated it seriously and it wanted the government to treat it in such a fashion. The government indicated it was going to oppose our amendment. Consequent upon that, I stood and advised that the position of the Labor Party had not changed: because of the actions in respect of the guillotine and the fact that our amendment had not been treated seriously, we would vote against the amendment when it was put. Subsequent to that, Senator Ray rose in his place and, on two occasions, asked the Chairman to read out the amendment before us, and the Chairman read the preamble to the amendment. So there was no confusion or misunderstanding on our part that we were discussing, and later voting on, the telephone sex amendment. I accept that Senator Margetts and Senator Brown might have been confused and might not have had access to the running sheet on the bill at the appropriate time. As far as I was concerned, we had the running sheet all evening and the Labor Party was aware of the context of the particular amendment that was being put.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Firstly, taking the lead from Senator Faulkner, it is clear to us that if some or all minor party senators were not aware of what was going on, it would be appropriate for Senator Allison, who has had carriage of telecommunications matters, to rise in this place and advise the chamber that she was confused and did not understand the particular amendment that was being put. Secondly, Senator Colston, as we are all aware, was the swing vote in this. We had advised Senator Harradine that we were going to oppose the 
 amendment. Senator Harradine went to the government side, as did Senator Colston, when the motion was put by the Chairman. It was called on the voices. Only opposition senators voted no. Government senators voted yes, and there was no objection, no movement and no shifting from Senator Harradine or Senator Colston.</para><para>We looked down to the end of the chamber and there was no movement by the Democrats or other minor party senators. On that basis, we understood the will of the chamber to be as called by Senator West, the Chairman. In that context, we would seek a full explanation from Senator Allison. We would also seek a full explanation from Senator Colstonâbecause we looked at him, he did not move or indicate opposition in any way, and we think it appropriate for him also to advise the chamber as to whether his position was misrepresented.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>5896</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think `confusion' was a good word to use for the passage of these amendments. I indicated in various speeches, both last night and when we previously dealt with this bill, that we would oppose those amendments. So I think the Labor Party was quite clear about it. I cannot recall whether I actually heard the Labor Party say they were opposed to these amendments, and I am quite happy to say that we would like to see a recommittal of the vote because of that general state of confusion.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âThat was truly pathetic.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5896</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI agree with what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate said. That was a pathetic attempt, Senator Allison, to be quite frank. I draw your attention to page 5772 of yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , which deals with this question. The Chairman said:</para></talk.start><para>The question is that government amendments Nos 5 and 39 on sheet ER229 be agreed to.</para><para>Then Senator Mark Bishop got up and made a few comments, and he made it perfectly clear that the matter was about phone sex, and, in a minute or two, he outlined it succinctly.

For anybody who was listening or following the debate at all, there was no confusion at all; none whatsoever. If you were listeningâyou did not have to have the sheet before youâyou would have known what it was all about.</para><para>The remaining stages went through. Senator Brown indicated that he did not understand a response from the chair about Senator Ray's request for the amendments to be completely read out. Then the question was put and resolved in the affirmative. These were the government amendments. Then a further vote took place, and was resolved in the negative, in respect of Democrat amendments Nos 2 and 7. So it was perfectly clear to everybody what the situation was, if they had ears to hearâparticularly as Senator Mark Bishop got up and explained why the opposition was not supporting government amendments Nos 5 to 39.</para><para>I do not propose, therefore, to support the suspension of standing orders, and I think that we ought to get on with what I am down here for, which is the biodiversity bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>5896</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not going to go into all the ins and outs of this. Normally if there is a claim of inadvertence in the Senate, the matter goes to another vote and there is not a lot of analysis as to why a particular person has missed a vote or otherwise. So I think most of the debate today is irrelevant from that point of view. If the people in the chamber were too dopey to understand what was before the chair, that is bad luck. It was 
 unfortunateâI have to say to Senator Harradine and othersâthat, having asked for an explanation as to what was before the chair, we had half of it read out and the guillotine then cut off the other half of it.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âBut the half made it abundantly clear what it was about.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âTo most people, Senatorâto people of your eminent perception who grasp issues so quickly.

It has been brought in here before we have seen the amendments the government is going to move to this legislation. It has been brought in here before we have had a chance to scrutinise the deal that has been done between the government and the Australian Democrats on this extremely important piece of legislation. This is a bill that can wait. If a deal has been done with the Democrats, let that deal become subject to public scrutiny. If a deal has been done, let all the stakeholders involved have access to the 
 finetuning of it so that we can see what will be passed in this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation should not be debated before we have a chance to see the government's amendments and before we have a chance to draft amendments to the government's amendments. We have a situation where right at this moment the Australian Democrats are announcing the structure or the formality of a deal with the governmentâthe final details of it or the start of it, one or the other; we do not even know that. But what we do know is that, for a party that has for a long time protested as being a green party, the Democrats have become gangrene. They have lost their direction. They are going to lose their constituency, and they are going to lose it for good reason. This is a bill that is not just about legislative efficiency. This is not a debate about reducing administrative complexity and duplication. It is not a debate about clarifying the responsibilities of each level of government for the protection of the environment. This debate is about the Howard government's determination to revisit history and to remake it. This debate is about this government's ideologically driven obsession to restage battles long lost by the forces of conservatism in this country, to reset the rules of engagement and thus to erase from the record the victories won by environmentalists for some 30 years. The Australian Democrats, sad to say, are compliant partners in this course.</para><para>The government seeks to remove the Commonwealth as an active combatant on the side of environmental and biodiversity protection. They would have this nation turn its back on international undertakings and responsibilities by radically diluting the Commonwealth's power. No matter how you try to amend this legislation, as the Democrats probably now will protest they have done, there are at least 17, if not more, escape clauses through which the Commonwealth minister and the Commonwealth government can flick back Commonwealth responsibilities to the states.</para><para>The government has presented this bill as the only comprehensive and fundamental attempt to reform environmental responsi 
 bilities in the history of our federation. Unfortunately, however, although this bill may be the largest environment bill introduced into this parliament, neither is it comprehensive in coverage nor does it achieve fundamental reform of Commonwealth environmental laws. The fact is that in many ways this bill returns environmental law in Australia to the pre-1970s situation, when environmental concerns were the sole province of the states. The bill significantly limits the scope for Commonwealth activity on environmental issues. Even within that limited scope, the bill provides for an extremely broad range of exemptions from its standard procedures on the so-called matters of national environmental significance. Ministerial discretion in this legislation is uniformly unfettered by any semblance of clear environmental standards. Public participation in critical environmental decisions is negligible.</para><para>Unsurprisingly, this bill and its companion consequential bill engage in another mean-spirited attack on the hard-won rights of indigenous people in this country. This bill contains amendments which have taken no account of the principles of joint management and show no respect for the expertise of indigenous communities in caring for their environment and for their attachment to it. This is a bill which has met with universal opposition from stakeholders, no matter where they come from in the political spectrum.</para><para>Let us look at the history that has been overturned by this legislation, and let us look at the history that the Australian Democrats are compliant in overturning. National and international awareness of the importance of protecting the environment has blossomed over the last 40 to 50 years. International awareness of the environment is a significant example of the new social movements of the late 20th century. This is a movement driven by local communities' concern about the effects of unchecked pollution, industrialisation and unsustainable resource use.</para><para>Australia has been no exception to this international phenomenon. All of the great environmental battles fought in Australia have had strong community support and polling still consistently shows environmental issues 
 high on the list of community concerns. This consciousness has emerged in parallel with such developments as international human rights institutions and the recognition of the right of colonised people to self-determination.</para><para>The 1972 declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment marked the beginning of a serious attempt by the world community to weld world environmental concerns to economic and social issues. As with the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the declaration in 1972 on the environment is an aspirational statement concerned with the potentially catastrophic effects of unchecked industrial development and resource use on the quality of life of all people and the conservation of nature and ecosystems. During the past three decades these aspirational statements have been fleshed out in a range of specific international environmental treaties relating to environmental damage, the marine environment, protection of the atmosphere, nuclear risks and the conservation of nature and other living things.</para><para>In the early 1970s the ALP introduced the first ever national approach to environmental regulation with the introduction of the EPIP Act. This legislation was aimed at ensuring that significant environmental matters are considered in relation to actions, proposals and decisions taken by the federal government and its agencies. It was through this national approach to environmental legislation that we conducted an inquiry into sand mining on Fraser Island in Queensland. That inquiry was able to proceed and the recommendations of that inquiry convinced the Fraser government to use other Commonwealth powersâthose ad hoc powers that the current minister refers toâto stop sand mining on the island.</para><para>We have had other Commonwealth initiatives on the environment which have also been critical to saving what are now considered inviolable national environmental icons. The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1975, again passed by the Labor government, ensured that invaluable areas such as Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta became national parks under national Commonwealth control. Fol 
 lowing the 1983 election, fought partially on the question of the construction of the Gordon below Franklin dam, the Hawke government introduced the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. That act was used later in that decade to stop the logging of the Queensland wet tropics, including the Daintree forest, by the Queensland National Party.</para><para>We had then a mentality in the states which is probably still the same now, a mentality best reflected by the Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose attitude was, `You can do so much with a bulldozer.' You can do so much with a bulldozer unless you have a Commonwealth government that is responsible and acting responsibly. This government is not. We must remember that both these Commonwealth interventions were fought tooth and nail by conservative state governments and also by the then federal opposition under the guise of protecting state rights. The Commonwealth government, under Labor, invoked the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 to stop the logging of the Lemonthyme forests in Tasmaniaâforests identified for world heritage listing. The Commonwealth similarly intervened to stop the proposal to mine the ecologically and culturally unique Coronation Hill site in Kakadu.</para><para>The telling point about all this is that you need a national approach to environmental security. All these icons would have been destroyed had their future been allowed to be determined by state governments. From a constitutional perspective, the legal struggles initiated by the states against the Commonwealth's legitimate use of power to achieve such environmental protection has resulted in a series of High Court decisions finding that the Commonwealth has near to plenary constitutional power to enact laws to protect the environment. Nothing in this bill protects that constitutional power. This government has drafted a bill that provides the potential to hand over environmental control to the states and territories. We have come full circle. This time, however, we are completing that circle without the Australian Democrats on board.</para><para>I will now move to the details of this legislation. This bill purports to carve up the respective responsibilities of the Common 
 wealth and the states. They use a definition of so-called matters of national environmental significance. Even this small list of matters is in some senses not sufficiently protected by Commonwealth action because even in these areas Commonwealth control can cascade directly to state and territory control. There are narrow concepts of the operation of `national' matters within the bill. For instance, there are only six specific matters of national environmental significance and one catch-all provision through regulation. Even with respect to those matters there can be a cascading of Commonwealth powers.</para><para>The policy justification for these six matters is the COAG agreement, but let us remember that the COAG agreement identified some 30 matters of national environmental significance. In this legislation we have only six and the most important matters relating to climate change, greenhouse gases, ozone depletion, air quality, soil salinity, desertification, water allocation, land degradation, land clearing and so on have all been left to languish either with the states or in that never-never land between Commonwealth and state responsibilities. This is hardly a satisfactory outcome for the environment. It is hardly a satisfactory outcome for certainty for industry and the states.</para><para>But that is not the only concern. It is not just a limitation in terms of matters of national environmental significance; we have a whole raft of other mechanisms through which the states are given responsibility to exercise the power that the Commonwealth should be assuming. In respect of that, we have the concept of bilaterals. I must start with the concept of bilaterals because I think this is a particularly insidious concept. Through bilateral agreements we basically have a situation where the Commonwealth can vest authority in the states for both the approval and the assessment of a particular project. The bilateral agreement concept has met with universal reaction and concern from across the stakeholders. The proposed operation of bilateral agreements has caused acute concern for both industry and environmental groups. </para><para>The bill provides that a bilateral agreement may declare certain classes of action exempt 
 from the Commonwealth approval processes if they have been approved by the Commonwealth, a state or a territory; they have been approved by a specified agency in a specified matter; or the actions are in accordance with a strategic assessment. Let me say in respect of all those conceptsâspecified action and specified mattersâthat it is essentially left to an unfettered discretion by a federal minister. The bill explicitly excludes a decision by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation, however defined, to another person to take an action that excludes from environmental control. Moving on from bilateral agreements, the bill also provides a capacity for the minister to declare that a proposed action does not require Commonwealth approval if the Commonwealth or one of its agencies has approved the action in a specified manner.</para><para>The list goes on. There is a capacity for the minister to agree to a strategic assessment of the impact of a policy, plan or program with a person or corporation responsible for such plans. So they can get together, they can come to an agreement in respect of a policy, plan or program and then the minister can declare that such policy, plan or program does not require Commonwealth approval. Given the wideness of the phrase and given the lack of scrutiny over the mechanism used here, there has got to be concernâand it is quite amazing that once again the Democrats have decided they can actually come to an agreement with the government in respect of this.</para><para>We then have conservation agreements. The minister says, `Oh, you've got them already,' but what we do not have already is the breadth of conservation agreements that the minister introduces in this legislation and also the lack of scrutiny over them. In terms of these conservation agreements, there are no environmental requirements for conditions on the discretion of the minister to enter into conservation agreements. There is also, for instance, no requirement for input from traditional owners in relation to conservation agreements. I mentioned world heritage earlier. In respect of world heritage listed areas, the bill only obliges the Commonwealth to develop a written management plan for a 
 world heritage area if it falls within a Commonwealth area. There is no requirement in this legislation for such a plan in relation to a world heritage area falling within a state or a territory, despite the Commonwealth's specific international obligations on this point.</para><para>The history of the seventies would provide testament to the fact that we need a broader range of areas to be covered here. For instance, the billâin respect of world heritageâonly requires the Commonwealth to establish a permit system in relation to a threatened species, threatened ecological communities and migratory species in relation to Commonwealth land only. So if you want certainty and if you want a lack of duplication, you will not get it here, because the Commonwealth has responsibility in respect of a limited range of land and the states may choose not to take up their responsibility in respect of other sectors of Australian land. So you will find stakeholders having to go through two processes to get one outcome.</para><para>I mentioned indigenous communities. Their concerns over this legislation are many. Despite a last minute concession by the government, given what we know so farâand, once again, we have not seen the agreement with the Democratsâthere is concern that there will be disruption to joint management arrangements in respect of areas such as Kakadu, Uluru and Wreck Bay; disruption that will be unacceptable to the traditional owners and their supporters. The environmental bills were developedâdespite a commitment by the minister that nothing would be done without the consent of TOsâwith negligible consultation with indigenous communities. They got a commitment that there would be no change without consent; the next thing they saw was legislation which disrupted the existing system of joint management.</para><para>Bilateral agreements, for instance, may impair or extinguish aspects of native title, and they significantly undermine world respected joint management practices in the Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks. Let us be mindful of this: by disrupting those existing joint management plans, there is a real legal possibility that the existing arrange 
 ments between traditional owners and the Commonwealth could very well be overturned. Leases held by the Commonwealth could be terminated by the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and land taken from the traditional owners. There are specific clauses proposed in this legislation that anticipate such an event, clauses that would lead to the termination of leases. More than most other Australians, I would say, indigenous people have a very strong interest in the environment through their continuing close physical, spiritual, social and economic attachment to it, and in many cases there is dependency on the land and its native flora and fauna. These people have been ignored in the process. These people get ridden over in this legislation.</para><para>Our view of the bill is that it needs amendment. I said to the minister a few weeks ago that we have some 200 to 300 amendments to this legislation. We really have close to 300 amendments but they cannot be finalised until we see the government's amendments. They cannot be finalised until we see what deal has been done, once again behind closed doors, between this minister and the most gullible of senators, Lyn Allison and Meg Lees. We do not know what is happening with the Democrats. They have basically excluded from consultation their self-claimed constituency, the environmental groups. They have been told over the last few weeks that they have no place at the table. But now we seem to have an outcome which is acceptable to both the Democrats and the government. From our perspective and the perspective of so many concerned people, not just now but over the last 30 or 40 years in the struggle for environmental issues in this country, there is real disquiet, unrest and concern about this arrangement. A bill that we thinkâand that the Environmental Defender's Office thinksâneeds some 300 amendments is coming in for debate in this place at the last moment without any clear idea of what the government's amendments are.</para><para>We will try to amend this legislation. We fear a guillotine. We know that the Democrats and the government do not fear a guillotine. We have had the message already that there 
 is a suggestion that this legislation should go through as quickly as possible so that stakeholders do not become wised up to the implications of it. We will try to take every opportunity in this place to ensure that there are amendments. As I say, we have some 300 amendments. We have amendments that go to the review mechanism, transparency of decision making, public accountability, natural justice and the rights of indigenous Australians. We need to broaden the scope of the legislation in accordance with the COAG agreement. We need to have greenhouse triggers, for instance. We are basically going to try to do in this parliament what the government has not done with this legislation over the last 12 months or so.</para><para>Any acceptable bill will retain a pivotal role for the National Parks and Wildlife Serviceânot just as a token position or as a substitute for the body as a whole. Clear penalties are neededâin some circumstances, criminal penalties. We will provide for the Auditor-General to fulfil the environmental audit functions that this legislation prescribes. We will move amendments to better protect world heritage areas. We do not want to water down the currently existing provisions. We need to ensure that this legislation takes the opportunity to protect Ramsar wetlands. We need to redraft provisions for committees to ensure, for instance, indigenous representation with respect to some.</para><para>Basically, this is a bill drafted in the department of, I suppose, wishful thinking on behalf of a minister who is wedded to the concept of state rights. It seeks to banish the pesky greenies from the agenda. This is a bill that, basically, will trigger broad community concern. It will trigger the sort of action that we used to have in the 1960s and 1970s. When people cannot access the rights they fought for through the parliament and the courts, they will take to the streets, the forests and so on to protect the areas they have always wanted to protect and they thought were protected from the hands of government, avaricious developers and other such stakeholders.</para><para>The minister could have dealt with this better. He should take the bill away and start 
 again. The least he should do is complete the debate on the second reading at this stage and bring the bill back in August. That would give the public, stakeholders and the parliament some time to scrutinise the legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>5903</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will be speaking on what is contained in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. My colleague Senator Brown, who will make a contribution later, I am sure, will be speaking in detail about what the bill is actually going to be when it is presented to us, as it has been transformed in view of the deal between the Australian Democrats and the government.</para></talk.start><para>We admit that a review of Australia's environment legislation is well overdue. Since the pioneering environmental legislation of the 1970s and the 1980s was put in place, there have been considerable changes in our understanding of ecological processes, in the community's expectation of government and in our understanding of the extent of the Commonwealth's powers, which can be considerable, as shown by various High Court decisions. That community expectation, I hasten to add, has not decreased; it has increased.</para><para>We also have a greater desire to deal with the environment and the economy in an integrated manner. I would argue, and have argued over the last six years, that separating those is artificial and damaging. The bill is a severe disappointment in terms of providing Australia with forward looking legislation that can help us face the environmental challenges that are either emerging or already with us. In some respects the bill has the potential to be a complete disaster.</para><para>The Greens (WA) consider that the development process of the bill itself reflects the government's underlying desire to wash its hands of any significant involvement in environmental affairs. The main genesis of the bill is the heads of agreement by the Council of Australian Governments of 1997, otherwise known as the COAG agreement. We do not consider that COAG is a valid basis for legislation because of its secrecy and lack of accountability. The only interest group seri 
 ously considered has been government, and the lowest common denominator has often prevailed.</para><para>The Greens (WA) believe that more genuine efforts to consult with the public during the development of the bill would have resulted in legislation that better reflected community concerns. Although the minister released a consultation paper on the proposed legislation, many of the witnesses told the committee that there was limited time to respond to the proposals and the government appeared not to have taken into account the comments that had been made. Complaints about the process came from the full range of industry, environment and community groups. Traditional owners were not consulted in any meaningful way on proposed changes to their lease agreements in Uluru, Kakadu and Booderee.</para><para>The consideration of the bill by the public and the committee was also made difficult by the lack of detail in relation to bilateral agreements and the regulations which are fundamental to an understanding of the implications of the bill and to its `successful' operation. Industry groups noted time after time that this created an unacceptable degree of uncertainty for them, and consistently requested that the legislation be delayed. Overall, the bill is an attempt to wind the clock back and allow the Commonwealth to retreat from its responsibilities. This is the only explanation, for example, that can be given for limiting Commonwealth environmental assessment and approval to a mere six matters in the bill.</para><para>The Commonwealth is also retreating from its national and international environmental obligations in its proposed use of bilateral agreements with the states and territories to hand over Commonwealth assessment and approval responsibilities. While the Greens (WA) have no conceptual difficulties with the states and territories having a role in assessment processes, this must only occur subject to best practice environment processes and other safeguards, and based on an acceptance of Commonwealth involvement and approval. These safeguards and constraints are missing, reinforcing the overall impression of the bill 
 that the Commonwealth is giving itself as many avenues as possible to devolve its environmental obligations, despite the various answers given by the minister in response to questions leading up to this bill.</para><para>Overall, there are three fundamental objections to the bill. There are lots of others, but these are fundamental. The first is the inadequate definition and use of ecologically sustainable development principles in the bill. ESD has become the concept that encapsulates the desire to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account in all economic and social decision making. The concept of ecologically sustainable development, it was argued, was originally designed to ensure that environmental considerations were taken into account in all decision making, economic and social. I have heard it argued also that originally ESD principles were to give industry a greater say, but when people started looking at those principles they realised they had to strike a balance that was fairer to the environment.</para><para>So ironically the process of ESD was about giving industry a greater involvement and even governments have turned away from that, especially this government. Unfortunately, the phrase has been contorted even further in the intergovernmental negotiation processâand hence in the EPBC Billâso that all Australian governments could at least give lip-service to it. For example, the definition of ESD in the EPBC Bill has the precautionary principle and public involvement as `guiding principles' only, not as core objectives.</para><para>Many submissions and witnesses commented that the objects clause contains watered-down objectives that do not project a strong commitment to environmental protection and that environmental issues take second place to economic and social issues. For example, while the bill requires decisions on environmental approvals to take all economic and social considerations into account, ESD principles, such as they are, need only to be taken into account in relation to the particular matter which triggers assessmentâclause 136. In effect, the bill ensures that economic and social factors are incorporated into environ 
 mental decisions, maybe. It does not require environmental factors to be part of social or economic decision making.</para><para>Why I said `maybe' is that in the past once again the Labor government set up the Resources Assessment Commission to do this very thing. Currently, there is no equivalent of the Resources Assessment Commission. So what process is going to take place? Could it be that resources and economic ministers are still going to have the say over what goes on in the environment? Hence the objects of this EPBC Bill, for example, should indicate an unequivocal commitment to protect the environment, rather than `to provide for the protection of the environment'.</para><para>In a similar vein, the bill should commit to ecologically sustainable development, rather than `to promote ecologically sustainable development'; that is, to promote as in, `We'll think about it, we'll look into it'âthe mirror-mirror syndrome. And the bill should conserve biodiversity, rather than `to promote the conservation of biodiversity'âsend out a few leaflets; that should do. The objects should also explicitly acknowledge the importance of public consultation and involvement in environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, but it becomes very inconvenient for federal governments to actually listen to the community, doesn't it?</para><para>Ecologically sustainable development should be defined rigorously in all environmental legislation, and the objects of any legislation should place ecologically sustainable development and its principles at centre stage. For example, qualifications like those in the objects of the EPBC Bill are unacceptable. Public involvement at all key stages in environmental planning and approval processes should also always be required. Quite frankly, within government departments there is not the knowledge, skill and depth of information to provide for proper decision making unless the community is involved. There is not the money to provide that within the environment departments. The knowledge is often with the community and it is not even possible for all that intimate, detailed local knowledge to be gained by one government department or even two.</para><para>Let us look at the limited view as to the Commonwealth's responsibilities. There is no question that the EPBC Bill is based on a very narrow view of Commonwealth environment involvement. There can be no justification to restricting Commonwealth involvement in assessment and approval to a mere six matters of national environmental significance. The set chosen by COAG ignores some of the most significant environmental challenges facing Australia today: climate change, the clearing of native vegetation which is one of the most serious threats to Australia's biodiversity, the loss and degradation of native forests, and the unsustainable use of water. These matters are undoubtedly of national environmental significance and should be subject to the Commonwealth's environmental assessment and approval process.</para><para>The majority report on the EPBC Bill argues that the bill is not intended to address all matters of national environmental significance identified in the COAG Heads of Agreement. The government asserts that broadscale matters such as climate change and vegetation clearance are being adequately dealt with by programs and policy responses. Yet Australia continues to see, for example, an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and an alarming loss of native vegetation. The involvement of the Commonwealth in government programs such as the Greenhouse Challenge is not a substitute for the capacity to assess and approve the environmental impacts of particular projects; for example, the building of a large coal power plant. Similarly, the existence of the national pollutant inventory is not a substitute for the capacity to assess, approve and impose conditions on a new petrochemical plant. It is clear that administrative approaches alone are not sufficient and require legislative backing.</para><para>The majority report argues that there are practical difficulties in applying environmental impact assessment to climate change, vegetation clearance and water issues in a way which is consistent with Commonwealth environmental powers and which does not overlap state and local government responsibilities. The Greens (WA) note that a number 
 of witnesses and submissions indicated that appropriate thresholds could be applied so that only major activities of national environmental significance require environmental assessment and approval by the Commonwealth.</para><para>Any list of matters of national environmental significance requiring environmental impact assessment should therefore include at least climate change, native vegetation, forests and the sustainable use of water, with appropriate thresholds to exclude matters that are not of national significance. These are in addition to those matters proposed by the government in the EPBC Bill. There is concern about the large scope for ministerial discretion and other exemptions from the bill.</para><para>The bill does contain a number of positive elements. However, these are relatively small benefits when the overall bill and the process by which it was developed are considered. While the bill purports to deal with matters of national environmental significance, the omissions are so obvious, and the qualifications to those remaining potentially so extensive, that they amount to a fundamental abrogation of the Commonwealth's environmental responsibilities.</para><para>Many witnesses expressed concern about the numerous avenues for exemption under the EPBC Bill. In addition to the problem of the limitation to six matters that can `trigger' Commonwealth assessment and approval, there are a number of ways by which the requirement for an approval can be avoided altogether.</para><para>The way that bilateral agreements can be used is discussed above. The Greens (WA) and the Australian Greens consider it essential that the Commonwealth not be able to evade its environmental responsibilities through ministerial declarations, conservation agreements and things such as regional forest agreements. Ministerial discretion also needs to be reined in to reduce the potential for making arbitrary decisions and evading obligations to protect the environment and conserve biodiversity.</para><para>There also appears to be a clear intent on the part of the Commonwealth to use the EPBC Bill to give away its responsibilities for 
 approving actions impacting on matters of national environmental significance, despite what the minister has said again and again. The EPBC Bill does not even provide for sufficient safeguards to ensure that accredited state governments fulfil the national obligations entrusted to them. So it has no teeth.</para><para>That these safeguards and constraints are missing reinforces the overall impression of the bill that the Commonwealth is giving itself as many avenues as possible to devolve its national and international environmental obligations. It is unacceptable to devolve approval powers relating to matters of national environmental significance, particularly given the Commonwealth's responsibility for meeting Australia's obligations under international environment agreements and the poor record of states and territories in protecting the environment. I mention my own state of Western Australia's poor record on greenhouse gas emissions. Then the Western Australian government say that the rest of the states have to reduce theirs so they can produce more. What a joke.</para><para>Given the need for consideration of the environment in all policy decisions and for those decisions to be reviewed and audited, the Greens would like to propose that a commissioner for the environment be established. There is no provision in the EPBC Bill for independent reviews of the environmental role and operations of the Commonwealth government.</para><para>A number of submissions and witnesses presented compelling evidence on the need for an independent authority to conduct such reviews and report to the public. The Australian Greens and the Greens (WA) consider that a commissioner for the environment would provide an important safeguard for ensuring best environmental practice. For example, a commissioner could investigate and report on whether any environmental agreements with the states were consistent with rigorous accreditation criteria and whether states were complying with conditions in those agreements.</para><para>It is clear that the momentum for achieving ecologically sustainable development in the operations of the Commonwealthâwhich 
 began with the ESD Working Group process in the early 1990sâhas been lost. The Greens (WA) believe that the momentum must be renewed by placing an obligation on Commonwealth departments and agencies to prepare and implement individual strategies for achieving ecologically sustainable development. We heard just yesterday in the report on energy efficiency strategies that a great deal of those policies have not even been implemented in Commonwealth buildings. So it just shows how lacking in political will we are at the moment.</para><para>A commissioner for the environment would have an important role in auditing the performance of departments in implementing their strategies. This concept has been put into practice in other countries such as Canada, where the annual green reports of the Commissioner for the Environment and Sustainable Development are providing valuable independent information on the performance of the federal government in fulfilling its environmental objectives and promises.</para><para>A commissioner for the environment should be established as an independent authority to review the performance of the Commonwealth in fulfilling its environmental objectives and priorities. For example, it could review the performance of Commonwealth departments in implementing their ESD strategies.</para><para>The Greens believe that the bill should be withdrawn. I will give you another reason for this: to enable a genuine community consultation process to be implemented to help draw up replacement legislation that reflects the Commonwealth's responsibility to protect Australia's environment. We are backed up in this by a number of key Aboriginal groups who have had concerns. There are major issues in the bill of great concern to indigenous Australians, and indigenous Australians have been some of the most determined in their approach to us on the need for deferral of this bill</para><para>Indigenous people have a very strong general interest in the environment through their continuing physical, spiritual, social and economic attachment and dependency on the land and its native wildlife. Many indigenous people live within an integrated set of cultural 
 and natural heritage values, transforming land and environment into landscape and country. They often have an intimate knowledge of native flora and fauna and its relationship to the environment. Indigenous people own and reside in a significant portion of Australia's marginal and fragile landscapes. Indigenous people have historically suffered the most from environmental effects, mistakes and disasters of inappropriate land use and exploitation.</para><para>Any proposals on these issues need to be thoroughly canvassed with indigenous communities, and consultations need to take account of culturally appropriate methodologies. These include allowing time for consideration by traditional owners, representative bodies and the broader community. Most indigenous stakeholders do not have access to national media or familiarity with legislative processes and have therefore not had an opportunity to consider the nature and substance of the government's proposals. While they may be represented by organisations such as land councils or ATSIC, these bodies cannot truly represent all of the indigenous concerns without the opportunity, in a realistic time frame, to consult directly with their constituents.</para><para>There has never been a dedicated and complete exercise to map the range of indigenous environmental concerns. On this basis, until there is consultation directly with indigenous stakeholders, the government cannot be sure that they have appropriately framed the range of Commonwealth powers or developed appropriate mechanisms to reflect and respond to indigenous concerns. I have heard very concerning reports in relation to the bill that indigenous stakeholders went to the Democrats and put those concerns strongly to them and that they believe they have not been properly heard. We will hear what the outcome is today. I am sure my colleague Senator Brown will mention them.</para><para>A major issue for indigenous people is the lack of monitoring of state regimes by the federal government and the conditions under which responsibilities may be transferred to the states. The stakeholders are very clear in their view that their concerns about consulta 
 tion have not been taken seriouslyânot by the government, in this case, or the Democrats. They stress that the consultation must involve more than just putting advertisements in the media and talking to peak organisations. A bill as important to Aboriginal people as this must be taken to the people. There must be a period of listening and waiting. Before my time expires, I move my second reading amendment:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add "but, noting concerns expressed by the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace Australia, the Wilderness Society, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, aboriginal traditional owners and others about the need to consult properly with respect to any proposed amendments to this bill, the Senate resolves that consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first day of sitting in August 1999".</para><para>There is more that I can say, but I hope that this bill at least will be given proper consideration. I would hate to think that this bill would be the source of a gag later on this day.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5907</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, at about the time I was bornâabout 10 years before you were brought forthâthe last live thylacine, the last Tasmanian tiger to be captured alive, was brought in to Waratah.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>âHas that got any relationship with his birth?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âIt has, you see. The parliamentary secretary quite properly asks has that got anything to do with his birth; and it has got a lot to do with his birth, in the sense that Senator McKiernan has lost the opportunity of ever seeing in the wild, or even in the zoo, a Tasmanian tigerâand that means that the generation to which he belongs has been denied that ability, because of what previous generations have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That leads to the first point I want to make, and it is this: the whole issue of the environment is a matter of what is right not simply for this generation but for other generations as well. Martin Flannigan in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> recently wrote a very evocative piece about the Tasmanian tiger and said not only that had it gone, apparently disappeared, but that there are now desperate efforts to try to 
 get it back, to recreate the Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine, because of what has been lost.</para><para>That is very much what this debate on the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]  is all about and what the issue of the environment is all about. It is about what is lost and cannot be regained, and about what is proper to maintain and what is not. Does it matter that the Tasmanian tiger has disappeared? Does it matter that it was slaughtered and a bounty put upon it for many years before, too late, people realised what they were losing? I think it does matter and I do think it is a symbol. Unless you are careful, of course, you lose not only an animal that is unique but a desert that is unique, a piece of ground that is unique. You mightâgoing back to Senator Patterson's remarksâlose the state that the Great Ocean Road in Victoria is in at the moment, unless proper care is taken. You may lose clean air over cities, the beaches upon which the children play or the atmosphere in which people work. They are all issues of what the environment is about.</para><para>Nobody, it seems to me, is arguing that the environment is not important. But this legislation is such that there are signs that the Commonwealth is not taking the issue of the environment as seriously as it should. It is also taking the approach that somehow the states are separate in this issue from the Commonwealth; that somehow it is the states that are really responsible for the environment and not the Commonwealth; that the states have inherited the environment from the time that they were colonies and that it is the states' right or obligation to do all that really needs to be done about the environment, except on some big issues which are quite limited.</para><para>The bill, if passed, would give up rights that the Commonwealth has under the Constitution, in the sense of not exercising those rights. I do not mean that they would lose those rights under the Constitution but that they would give them up, in the sense of not exercising them as they should. There is a concept behind this bill which says that the states have the primary responsibility in protecting our environment and that the states 
 shall take up the task that is needed to ensure that the place we live in is a proper and reasonable place in which we can, as Australians, enjoy the life that is potentially there.</para><para>That is a wrong conception of the constitutional and legal obligations of the Commonwealth. It is clear from cases, such as the Franklin Dam case, that the Commonwealth has the power and, indeed, the obligation to protect our environment. To make that clear, I will quoteâand Senator Cook will recognise thisâfrom the Chief Justice of the High Court at the start of the 1970s, Sir Garfield Barwick, who was, prior to being the Chief Justice, a member of the Menzies government. This is what he says about the states and Commonwealth and the relationship between the two, in the case of Victoria and the Commonwealth:</para><para>I have observed elsewhere that the Constitution does not represent a treaty or union between sovereign and independent States. It was the result of the will and desire of the people of all the colonies expressed both through their representative institutions and directly through referenda to be united in one Commonwealth with an agreed distribution of governmental power.</para><para>He says later on:</para><para>The constitutional arrangements of the colonies were retained by, and subject to, the Constitution as the constitutional arrangements for the government of those portions of the Commonwealth to be known as States. These, though coterminous in geographical area with the former colonies, derived their existence as States from Constitution itself: and being parts of the Commonwealth became constituent States.</para><para>He goes on later, and this is the last bit that I will quote from him:</para><para>But the outstanding fact that the Actâ</para><para>that is, the act of the Imperial Parliamentâ</para><para>created the Commonwealth as the embodiment of the people of Australia and gave it, amongst other things, legislated power over the enumerated subject matters cannot be gainsaid.</para><para>What is being said is that the Constitution creates not only the Commonwealth but also the states and that the Constitution gives the Commonwealth power. On the basis of the power given by the Constitution, the Commonwealthâand this is me speaking now, on the basis of what Sir Garfield Bar 
 wick saidâhas a duty to ensure that all parts of Australia are properly protected.</para><para>When Lake Pedder was lost in Tasmania that was a loss not only for Tasmanians but for Australians as a whole. Do we as a nation say that the Great Barrier Reef is the responsibility of the Queensland government only? Do we say that the Great Australian Bight, which you fly over regularly, Mr Acting Deputy President, is a place that Victorians have no interest in, that only South Australians and West Australians have a say in that? Or are they part of a land which affects us all in terms of not only the comfort with which we might live but also our spiritual existence? When we talk about Australia we are talking about a certain sort of place; we are talking about an embodiment of a land that we love and respect.</para><para>This bill unfortunately, if passed, would enable people to exploit in a wrong manner the land which belongs to us all. That is what the issue of environmental protection and proper development is concerned withâhow the land can be used in a way that is suitable to the sort of place it is. History has shown us that over the couple of centuries that we as Europeans have been in Australia the land has been violated in a very serious manner. We have recently had sessions on televisionâI think it has been repeated a couple of times on the various channelsâabout the salt rising in the land and killing off the soil so that the land cannot properly be used. Is that an issue simply for the states in which that occurs or is that an issue for us as Australians?</para><para>When the second reading speech to this bill is looked at there is cause for alarm in terms of the concepts that the government has brought into the debate. For example, it states:</para><para>An activity which does not have a significant impact on one of the matters of national significance will no longer trigger Commonwealth involvement in the assessment and approval processâeven if it requires a Commonwealth decision or approval such as foreign investment approval.</para><para>The second reading speech states quite explicitly that the Commonwealth is going to draw back from its responsibilities, even when a decision is required from the Commonwealth 
 about the issue in hand. That is a statement which, in my view, condemns the government in its approach to this issue. The issue then arises against what standards, against what criteria are measurements to be made as to whether the land, air and sea are being used as they should be, with proper respect for the integrity of the land, sea and air. I notice on page 81 of the report on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 the following statement:</para><para>A large number of submissions criticised the Bill on the grounds that it contains few environmental standards in relation to bilateral agreements.</para><para>It goes on to say:</para><para>Key conservation groups were concerned that the standards set out in clauses 51 to 55 are `vague, non-binding and weakened by Ministerial discretion' and that the Bill provided too much discretion to set detailed standards in the regulations.</para><para>This is a matter of great and grave importance. How are we, as a nation, going to measure whether we have properly treated the land, air and sea which we claim is ours? The Commonwealth has not set out any criteria. There is no measurement set forth so that people who live on this land can measure against a set of tests as to how we as a nation are treating the land, sea and air with which we have been blessed, and we have been blessed in Australia. But, having been blessed with this land, we have not, up until recently in any event, turned our minds to how we can best protect the place we have been given.</para><para>During the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s we were as a nation taking on the responsibilities we had to this place that is ours, but this bill turns back the clock. As Senator Margetts has said, and as Senator Bolkus has pointed out, this is a backward step; this is going back to where we should not be. Madam President, I notice that two o'clock is upon us so I will sit down.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>5909</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Legislation</title><page.no>5909</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5909</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage,

 protect the environment from a national perspective but also would be easier to operate from the point of view of the usersâthose who have to operate within the legislation. That negotiation took place during 1997 and an agreement was reached under the head of COAG late in 1997. That became the framework for the development of the legislation. Then a further discussion paper was issued which fleshed out the details of the COAG agreement. The stakeholders, including the states, were invited to contribute further, and they so did.

After that, there was a process of negotiation, again taking into account the advice of the Senate committee and submissions that had been made direct to government by all of the key stakeholders, including the state governments.

All of a sudden he is playing catch-up politics and trying to win back a bit of a constituency. The constituency he is seeking has moved on; the constituency he is seeking wants to work with government to achieve better environmental 
 outcomes on the ground. Out of this piece of legislation those better outcomes can be achieved. It is good for the state governments; it is good for the environment; it is good for industry because they will have streamlined processes of assessment; and, most of all, it is good in terms of a better national environmental outcome.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra Sale: Social Bonus</title><page.no>5911</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5911</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

One of the major programs, of course, is Building Additional Rural Networks, a $70 million program which will give $10 million to each of the states. It is extraordinary, isn't it, that once you actually distribute money to all of the states you get howls from the Labor Party. Do they hate the minor states? Do they hate the bush? Clearly they do because, at the time of the last election, we had a Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund which had about $150 million in it and 
 Senator Schacht's lasting contribution to public debate was that he got up and promised to knock it off, close it down, put the money in his back pocket. He did not even have something else to spend it on. It was absolutely extraordinary. So why do they hate the bush? I do not understand it, Madam President, and I am sure the bush does not either.</para><para>We have a $45 million local government fund to enable local governments to get their services online. There is $6 million to each of the states and half that to each of the territories. Again, Labor want to knock it off. They hate this billion dollar program, do not see any redeeming virtue in it and carry on with rhetoric about bribes. What sort of a message is this sending to rural Australia and to the outlying states? It is basically that Labor could not give a damn. They are only interested in the people who Martin Ferguson is interested in. In other words, he is very worried about the chardonnay socialists who dominate places like the Australian Capital Territory. Quite rightly so; if you look at him, he obviously prefers a rough red. It ought to be blindingly obvious to the Labor Party that, if you want to get into the game, you have got to do a bit more than pander to a few of the elites in the metropolitan areas.</para><para>Of course all of this is premised on the privatisation of Telstra. Why is the Labor Party against it? Who knows? Their current leader, of course, is on the record as saying:</para><para>The Government has a proud record of successful privatisations . . .</para><para>. . . I can claim to have been in on the ground floor of that process . . . when we sold the Williamstown Dockyard, corporatised the aircraft factories to form Aerospace Technologies . . . and corporatised the rest of the factories and Garden Island Dockyard.</para><para>In addition, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation was sold . . .

There was not anything left when we got to government. We felt very frustrated. All the work had been done. There was only Telstra left. Where did Labor end up? Of course, opportunistically opposed. As Terry McCrann quite rightly says this morning, `You can't be 
 half pregnant; you've gone to a point where we now have only 50 per cent or a bit more.' He says that Telstra `will be left in a state of suspended animation' until `Kim Beazley abandons cargo-cult populism, Labor gets a real leader, or wins an election, or Meg Lees stops thinking of chickens, whichever comes first.'

As he is going to get a copy of the code, does the minister recall the Prime Minister explaining Senator Gibson's resignation as parliamentary secretary in October 1996 as being due to `the perception of a conflict of interest, and a proper application of the guidelines means he has been obliged to tender his resignation'? Is the minister also aware that, in defending Mr Entsch, the Prime Minister has stated that `the ministerial code is meant as a guide for people's behaviourâit is not meant as a death sentence'? Why was the code a death sentence for Senator Gibson but, for Mr Entsch, it is merely a guide which can be ignored with impunity?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5913</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is wrong, Madam President; it cannot be ignored with impunity. 
 Of course, the point is that it is for the Prime Minister to interpret and enforce the guidelines, and he does that. He did it in relation to Senator Gibson, and he did it in relation to Mr Entsch. All I would like to say in relation to Senator Gibson is that I think he is an excellent senator. I think he did an excellent job as a parliamentary secretary and, furthermore, he did no wrongdoing. The Prime Minister is more than happy to say that he paid a high price, but the Prime Minister demands very high standards. That might be something unfamiliar to the Labor Party, but this Prime Minister demands high standards and expects them to be met.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Further Sale</title><page.no>5913</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5913</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Chris  Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration.

It was a great thing for ordinary Australians to be able to invest in a great company. This government is offering a further opportunity for ordinary Australians to invest with this sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra. More than 1.8 million Australians took advantage of the opportunity to invest in Telstra. What we are seeing is Australians voting with their savings. They are saying: `We want to be a part of this.'

Secondly, it operates to prevent further exercise of jurisdiction by the Federal and Family Courts in matters where they rely on cross-vesting. It makes it desirable for all such matters currently before those courts to be transferred to state Supreme Courts and to give additional work to state courts and reduce the work of Federal Courts.</para><para>This decision did not come as a surprise, in the sense that a decision was impending for some time.

That legislation will validate past decisions of the Family Court and Federal Court which have been affected by the High Court decision. The legislation will also provide for the smooth transfer to state Supreme Courts of ongoing matters that the Family Court or the Federal Court can no longer handle.

I assume it is no different in the Albury area. The proposed route of the road through Albury-Wodonga is one that the Albury City Council has been lobbying successive federal and state governments for for over 30 years now. The member for Farrer, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Mr Lou Lieberman, the member for Indiâjust on the other side of the borderâboth support that internal route. As well, the Liberal state member for Albury, Mr Ian Glachan, also supports that route and he was just recently re-elected to his seat. So, Senator, when you say the people of Albury are opposed to it, I cannot imagine that is right when all three elected people representing the area support it and their support is well known and they continue to be re-elected.</para><para>I am sorry I did not write down the precise questions, and if I miss some of the specific questions you have raised, Senator, I will try and get you answers to themâbut you did raise the question of budgets and money. In the last budget we provided $7 million for further preconstruction works, such as investigation and design; preparation of tender documents; and land acquisition for the construction of this major project. In fact, your colleague Senator Lyn Allison went through this in some detail at the recent esti 
 mates committee.	The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority is the main planner of this area. Both the New South Wales government and the Victorian government in fact support the internal route but the New South Wales government has the responsibility for route selection and associated planning and environmental considerations. They are a state responsibility in the first instance. I am not trying to buck-pass: we the federal government accept what both state governments have said in relation to this.</para><para>The proposed route, we think, will have a lot of benefits. It will result in a massive improvement in the amenity of the residents along the existing route. It will remove the traffic problems currently affecting the commercial and residential areas of Albury. Even if the external route were built, it would provide very little benefit to the residents of Albury because nearly 90 per cent of the traffic along the existing route would still enter Albury, so I am told. Senator, you would be pleased to knowâas would your constituents or the people who approached you yesterdayâthat extensive measures are being taken to reduce the visual and noise impact of the route. Senator, I appreciate your concern. You are representing a view of some of the people of the Albury area, but I do not think it is a majority.

Secondly, is the government aware that in most other states road construction avoids internal routes, even through small country towns?

It has been the subject of very wide consultation with the people of Albury and, all in all, all of the experts and all of the authorities believe that it is the right one. I know you do not want me to give a dissertation on polls and opinion polls and mandates but, when you say that a poll of Albury people opposes it, you have to ask what the question was and how many actually responded to the poll. As we always say in this business, the only poll that really counts is on election day.

 That might be something that Senator Reynolds was involved in, as a senator from Far North Queensland. In relation to GBRMPA: yes, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is concerned about damage and potential damage to the reef from acid sulphate resulting, in turn, from developments up the Queensland coast. It is a complex issue. There is a growing awareness of that fact and the science is improving on what are the direct and indirect consequences that can flow therefrom.

She is correct in identifying that we did confirm, during the budget estimates hearings, that the federal government is continuing to fund the trustee to pursue Mr Skase's assets. The funding of $1.45 million is the extent of the Commonwealth's commitment in this matter in respect of completed activity. The federal government's funding has allowed the trustee to conduct overseas investigations in countries including the United Kingdom, Spain and the Cayman Islands and applications for injunc 
 tive relief in Australia, the Cayman Islands, the United Kingdom and Spain, and the court examination in 1998 of the United Kingdom lawyer. The government is continuing in its commitment to pursue Mr Skase in addition to its commitment to fund his trustee in bankruptcy. We will not let him, by any act of omission on our part, obviate his obligations as a bankrupt under Australian law. However, it would be inappropriate for me to give any details at this stage of further activity being undertaken by the trustee.</para></talk.start><para>Senators can be assured that the Spanish authorities remain committed to ensuring that the current expulsion proceedings are appropriately resolved in accordance with Spanish law. Mr Skase was notified by the Spanish authorities in October 1998 that his application for residency had been denied. The Spanish authorities presented Mr Skase with a formal order. Mr Skase has appealed against that order. Even if he loses his current appeal to the Spanish Administrative Court, he still has a further right of appeal back to the regional Superior Court. The government stands ready to seek his extradition from a country other than Spain. It bears repeating that it is not possible for us to reopen extradition proceedings in Spain. What I want to do at this point is put on record the Australian government's appreciation of the continued firm commitment from the Spanish government to ensuring that the current expulsion proceedings are appropriately resolved in accordance with Spanish law.</para><para>As to Mr Skase's health, we have all seen media reports of Mr Skase's recurring health problems.

 time of the original extradition proceedings. However, I would also make the point that Australia is naturally prepared to arrange for his direct return here on a properly equipped medical evacuation jet should he be sensible enough to decide that the time for fighting this is over and it is time for him to come home. We will provide a properly equipped medical evacuation jet to bring him home. The advice I have is that that evacuation would be at least as safe as the conditions under which Mr Skase is presently residing in Majorca. I conclude by saying, in response to some of the interjections from the other side, that those people who gave him a 10-year passport, who let him get away in the beginning, who failed in their extradition proceedings to bring him back to Australia and who released Federal Court documents in relation to this matter have no business interjecting whatsoever.</para></talk.start></continue></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Public Housing</title><page.no>5921</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5921</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services.

The truth is that Mr Entsch bought two lots of land at Koombal Park on East Trinity Inlet, jointly with his wifeâthat is, 400 metres up the road from a 700 hectare block that the British banking company Natwest hopes to develop. Although he bought the land for $26,000, the unimproved capital value of Mr Entsch's recent acquisitions was $195,000 in October 1996.</para><para>In September 1998, the Cairns City Council changed the East Trinity development control plan to relax planning controls along the East Trinity foreshore, giving this Natwest plan a very new lease of life. The proposal currently has a couple of stumbling blocks which are lack of accessâyou can only get there by water taxi or by a round-about roadâand the severe acid sulfate leaching and other soil toxicity problems that have been raised in question time today.</para><para>If the Natwest development goes ahead, it will house up to 20,000 residents and include 15,000 square metres of retail. In time, it will also necessitate the building of a bridge 
 between the Cairns CBD and the new suburb opposite, further adding to the value of Mr Entsch's holdings. What the opposition is concentrating on is what occurred after the election last year because Mr Entsch became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. On 2 April this year, in that capacity, Mr Entsch launched a CSIRO study into acid sulfate on the Natwest site and told the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>:</para><para>The only economically viable option might be to allow Natwest to go ahead with its development plans.</para><para>That is in the paper. The report gives another option. It says:</para><para>It's likely that viable management strategies are available for rehabilitation, including reflooding.</para><para>Then you have the workshopâperhaps Senator Hill had officers there. Who knows? There was a workshop on the acid sulfate problem, sponsored by Mr Entsch, using the services of CSIRO to discuss an initial site investigation that they had carried out on the Natwest site and ways of dealing with the acid sulfate soil problem, which we acknowledge is a serious issue. Mr Entsch told the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline>  on 20 May this year that the Commonwealth is sponsoring further monitoring by CSIRO and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in Senator Hill's portfolio.</para><para>The stench of Entsch just gets worse and worse. There is nothing wrong with a local member pushing for economic development in his electorateâwe know that every local member does that. But when a local member is the parliamentary secretary and can use the good offices of his own portfolio organisationâthat is, CSIROâto look into the potential of East Trinity, and when that same parliamentary secretary has investment properties up the road which depend on the development happening, we say that is not just an altruistic concern of a local member. We have concerns that it is a capital-C conflict of interest. Mr Entsch is obviously desperately trying to find a way to ameliorate the acid sulfate soils problem using CSIRO, desperately trying to promote the NatWest project which will inevitably lead to a bridge bringing his property within a few minutes drive 
 from Cairns. But the Prime Minister, as weak as he is, as incapable as he is of exercising moral authority, should deliver to the Australian public what everyone has been waiting for: some leadership. Mr Entsch must be stripped of his parliamentary secretaryship this afternoon. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5925</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate that it must be very difficult for this opposition at the moment. Here we have Australia in an economic circumstance where it is the envy of the world. Having inherited a deficit of over $10 billion, in just three years this Howard government has turned the economy to prosperity, prosperity particularly envied within our region. This prosperity has been achieved through good policies of soundly restraining expenditure, reforming industrial relations laws, privatising assets that are no longer appropriate in public hands and using the money to repay debt, keeping down interest ratesâthe lowest level in 30 yearsâkeeping down inflation to a stable and historically low level, giving the opportunity for Australians to prosper and, in particular, bringing the unemployment rate down to the lowest level it had been before we had the recession that was inflicted upon us deliberately by the former Labor Prime Minister, Mr Keating.</para></talk.start><para>The government is delivering so many benefits to the community as a whole, the latest of which we trust will be implemented in the next few days, and that is fantastic tax reform for this country. That tax reform will finally deliver to us a contemporary taxation system with $12 billion of reductions of income tax to put in place even more incentives for small business to grow, to invest and to provide jobs. It will give particular benefit to exporters to address the current account difficulties which Senator Cook reminds us of so often and get rid of the wholesale sales tax that is so inefficient and cumbersome and, with all the other benefits, get rid of the poverty trap so that all Australians can benefit in that way. The tax reform will provide a capital base from which governments in the future can deliver the services that are reason 
 ably required for Australians, whether they be health, education or any such fields.</para><para>In such circumstances as these, one can understand why an opposition would be desperate to find some issue that is irrelevant to the rest of Australia but on which they hope they can get a headline or two.

We all picked the grab that he hopes will be the one on the television tonight.</para><para>He tried to trick meâall right, I suppose that is part of the game during question timeâon what the rules are that the Prime Minister has set down in relation to directors. He got that wrong and I suspect he has got a lot of other things wrong as well. Okay, Mr Entsch, we concede, made a mistake and did not list his directorshipsânot a big mistake, because he had actually listed his shareholdings. We know that Labor members on the other side made the same mistake. I did not hear Senator Cook accuse them of using the dopey defence. And when Senator Richardsonâformer minister in this placeâforgot that he was a member of a board that ran a radio station, Senator Cook did not come in here and say, `He is entitled to the dopey defence.' Of course, there is one set of rules for the coalition and another set of rules for the Labor Party.</para><para>Nothing has been demonstrated against Mr Entsch that would suggest in any way that there has been improper behaviour on his part. He made a mistake. He owned up to the mistake. The Prime Minister accepted the explanation, because it was a reasonable explanation in the circumstances</para><para>What this opposition ought to do, instead of trawling in the gutter in this way, is to start looking at some questions of policy, to start organising itself into an opposition that might one day be capable of governing again, to set itself some goals to do better than when it was last in government, to develop its policies, to get some new blood on the frontbench, and give some of the newcomers a go, because I am sure they could do better than the tired lot that sit on the front bench in this place. When that starts to happenâand I do not care whether it is the new way, the 
 second way or the third way: it is good to see there are a couple of backbenchers wanting to make a difference, and it is a pity that the leadership of the Labor Party, including Senator Cook, cannot pick up the challenge as wellâthen the Labor Party will start to be relevant, and then the Australian people will see that they are at least entitled to consideration. But whilst they just continue trawling in the gutter on irrelevancies they will not be seen as relevant. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5926</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âImagine that last contribution.

Just as the last decade of the 19th century witnessed impassioned debate on the matters concerning the constitution and the nature of the two houses in the soon-to-be Federal Parliament, so too do we witness renewed debate on these issues as the 20th century draws to a close. But the similarity in the topics is only superficial; for the nature of the discussion is as different and divergent as the century or so that has passed between.</para><para>In the 1890s, our Constitutional debate was not about becoming a republic or remaining a constitutional monarchy. It was about turning a group of disparate colonies into a working federation. The debate over the form of the Senate at the time was closely linked to what our forebears apparently envisaged the role of the states in that federation would be. That debate culminated in a limiting of the powers of the larger colonies, New South Wales and Victoria, and gave the colonies equal status as States of the Commonwealth. If we fast-forward to the late 1990s, we find debate about power is still with us, only this time it is about the powers of minor parties and independents. This bill will allow the Senate, the House of Representatives and the wider community to consider the issues involved. The bill provides for the division of States into Wards for the purpose of choosing senators. It will limit the opportunity for minor party members and independents to exercise power far beyond the extent of their electoral support.</para><para>I have been considering the issues in this bill for some time nowâthat it corresponds with contemporary public debate on the role of the Senate is merely coincidental. The contentious issues in the current debate include the question of a "mandate", "fair representation" and what it means to review government legislation. Reference is still made to the importance of a "states' house" as the founding fathers would have intended the Senate to be versus the current existence of a partisan approach to the review of legislation proposed by the Government in the House of Representatives. While the presence of independent senators from time to time has given us a glimpse of how the Senate could work in favour of specific statesâand perhaps to the detriment of othersâthe Senate now is party-based and it is this reality with which we must deal. Thus the division of States into Wards as proposed by this bill will more accurately reflect the contemporary mechanisms of this Houseâit merely seeks to 
 formalise and acknowledge what, in actual fact, is really happening in our "House of Review".</para><para>In the context of the present debate, several suggestions have been canvassed regarding the possible electoral system on which the Senate is based. I consider that this bill is a concrete step towards the pursuit of Senate reform. I will outline the main features of this bill.</para><para>Section 7 of the Constitution states, among other things, that "The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate." The parliament has not otherwise provided and senators are therefore chosen by the people of the various Statesâand now the Territoriesâeach voting as one electorate.</para><para>The Electoral Amendment (Senate Elections) Bill 1999 proposes to alter the manner in which senators are elected to the Senate. Rather than represent the State as one electorate, the bill provides that each of the states is to be divided into six Wards, each ward having two representatives in the Senate. The representatives will still be regarded as Senators for the particular State in which their Wards exist. At a periodical half senate election, each Ward would return one senator for that State while at a Senate election following a dissolution, each Ward would return two senators. The bill does not alter the method of selection of Territory senators. At a Senate election following a dissolution, senators would be chosen using the current system of proportional representation, but at a half-senate election preferential voting, as currently used for House of Representatives elections, would be relied upon. It is proposed that ticket voting be retained for both types of elections in order to minimise the possibility of informal votes where a large number of candidates is involved.</para><para>The bill also makes consequential changes to the administration of the electoral system. The Australian Electoral officer in each State retains primary responsibility for administration of the Ward system, including the establishment and maintenance of separate Ward rolls. The Australian Electoral Officer is empowered to make whatever arrangements are necessary to maintain the rolls. It is envisaged that this would involve administrative arrangements with the divisional Returning Officers to ensure that information acquired by DROs in the course of their maintenance of divisional rolls is passed on to the Australian Electoral Officer for corresponding action in relation to the Ward rolls. The bill also provides for some modifications to the existing forms for nomination for the Senate.</para><para>As the expansion of the administrative structure required to administer the Ward system is untested, the bill provides that the establishment, maintenance and use of Ward rolls will be reviewed by 
 the Australian Electoral Commission five years after the commencement of the act and a report of the review will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament.</para><para>The bill also provides for transitional arrangements. Senators holding office at the commencement of the act will continue to represent their States as a whole for the remainder of their terms of office. It will be necessary for the initial distribution of each State into Wards to be undertaken as a first step to implementing the system. If a Senate election is held before a buffer period of twenty-one days has elapsed after this distribution process is completed, the transitional provisions provide that senators will be elected in accordance with the current system. Any casual vacancies occurring in relation to the places held by senators representing States as a whole would be filled on the same basis.</para><para>There is some argument that section 15 of the Constitution, as changed by the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977, entrenches direct elections of senators by the people of a state as a whole. It is not entirely clear whether section 15 precludes the appointment of a person by a State Parliament to represent a Ward, as opposed to the State as a whole. To safeguard against this possibility, item 17 of the bill provides that a senator appointed to a casual vacancy in a State is deemed to represent the Ward in respect of which the vacancy arose, for the purposes of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</para><para>Section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to decide who shall be "long term" and "short term" senators following a dissolution of the Senate. In part, that section provides that "the Senate shall divide the Senators chosen for each State into two classes, as nearly equal in number as practicable; and the places of the senators of the first class shall become vacant at the expiration of three years, and the places of those of the second class at the expiration of six years, from the beginning of their term of service".</para><para>The decision of which Senators are to be "long term" and "short term" is the untrammelled right of the Senate. It is expected, however, that should the proposed legislation in this bill be passed, in any future dissolution of the Senate, the new Senate would choose one senator from each Ward to be a senator of the first class and the other senator of that Ward to be a member of the second class.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>) adjourned. </para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>5935</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5935</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask that general business notice of motion No. 237, standing in my name for today and relating to an order for production of documents, be taken as a formal motion and, in doing that, indicate that, after discussions with the Manager of Government Business, I will be moving it in amended form.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âIs there any objection to this motion being taken as formal?

This report contains the results of the review by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties of the following proposed treaties:</para><para>.	 a treaty on extradition with South Africa;</para><para>.	 a treaty with Sweden on mutual assistance in criminal matters;</para><para>.	 an agreement with New Zealand on the status of visiting defence forces; and</para><para>. 	 two defence agreements with the United Statesâthe first concerning the reciprocal provision of logistic support, services and supplies, and the second concerning communications services.</para><para>In each case we support the proposed treaty and recommend that binding action be taken.</para><para>Our comments on the extradition treaty with South Africa represent a continuation of our support for the negotiation of modernised extradition arrangements.</para><para>The key element of these arrangements is that the country requesting extradition has only to provide the other country with a statement of the conduct of the alleged offences by the accused. This is a far more flexible and effective basis for extradition than the traditional arrangements, which require the provision of material sufficient to demonstrate a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline>  case against the accused.</para><para>It is important to note that the treaty with South Africa, like all modern arrangements, balances this flexibility by allowing the requested country to refuse extradition in circumstances where either the extradition, or the punishment arising from any conviction, would infringe the civil, political or human rights of the accused person. 
</para><para>The treaty on mutual assistance in criminal matters with Sweden also represents an improvement to our international network of law and justice arrangements.</para><para>Mutual assistance treaties play a valuable role in ensuring that law enforcement agencies are able extend their reach beyond national borders. Without such arrangements, the task of investigating and prosecuting trans-border criminal behaviour is complicated immeasurably.</para><para>The proposal to conclude a status of forces agreement between Australia and New Zealand is another step in maintaining the long-standing and close defence relationship between the two nations.</para><para>While it can hardly be argued that the agreement is a central plank in our defence relationship, the establishment of a standard scheme for the rights and obligations of visiting forces will secure a firm footing for two of the important elements in a healthy defence relationshipâthe exchange of personnel and participation in joint exercises.</para><para>In our view, Australia's national interest is also well served by the two defence agreements with the United States canvassed in our report.</para><para>The agreement on the reciprocal provision of logistic support, services and supplies (known as the Acquisition and Cross-servicing Agreement) is a standard form agreement that the United States Government is seeking to negotiate with all of its major defence partners.</para><para>The agreement establishes rules for the reciprocal provision of support and services in `combined exercises, deployments, operations and for unforeseen circumstances and exigencies'.

It will allow the Commonwealth Grants Commission to report on the distribution of funding for meeting the needs of indigenous people. It will also further the Government's aim of improving the situation of Australia's indigenous people by ensuring that an independent assessment of their need for services and programmes is undertaken.</para><para>The intention of the Government in taking this important step in providing a better basis for the distribution of funding for indigenous affairs was announced as a commitment during last year's election campaign. The new approach is designed to increase the confidence that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have in the distribution of funds because it will give them greater assurance that the distribution is based on need.</para><para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission is a world-renowned agency that has, until now, been restricted to measuring the relative needs of the States and Territories for untied Commonwealth funding, and to advising on the needs of the small Island Territories. Its expertise in assessing the relative needs of different communities has been underutilised and 
 this bill enables it to be asked to examine the needs of indigenous people.</para><para>The Grants Commission is an independent statutory authority and has always acted with absolute freedom in making its recommendations to Government. During an inquiry into the distribution of resources for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programmes, it will need to have close contact with the Departments and agencies currently involved in deciding the distribution of funding for those programmes, but it will continue to operate with its traditional degree of independence.</para><para>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be given opportunities to make both written and oral submissions to the Commission, and to show it the magnitude of their problems. This approach is in line with the Government's commitment to work with ATSIC and the wider indigenous community to develop arrangements to improve the allocation of funding, and to give the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people every chance to discuss their situation with those directly involved in advising the Government.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5940</page.no><id.no>s182</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>5940</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>5940</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore question time, during the debate on the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline> , I was saying that the issue of the environment is clearly a national issue, an issue that affects generation after generation and one where we as the present generation must act responsibly. I was saying that the Commonwealth must not roll back the constitutional obligation it has to look after the environment, and I was suggesting that the bill that is before the chamber is deficient in that respect. That proposition is well borne out by the amendments that are to be moved on behalf of the government and that have now been put on the tables of the senators in this place.</para></talk.start><para>As you will see, Madam Acting Deputy President, those amendments are many and the package that they are set out in is quite thick. As I go through them, I see such issues 
 raised as whether a person should be guilty of an offence for recklessly taking members of a listed threatened species or community and whether that should be punishable by a term of imprisonment, dealt with by a civil penalty or dealt with by a fine that has a criminal effect. So, just casting my eyes over these amendments, it appears that there is quite a considerable change in the thrust of what this legislation is all about.</para><para>I see in the amendments that have been put forward that the issue of commercial-in-confidence is dealt with. One of the amendments says that the secretary must not be satisfied `that a part of the report is commercial-in-confidence unless a person demonstrates' that to the secretary, and then it sets out a number of criteria. It is clear that the whole concept of what is proper environmental protection and how that environmental protection should be given expression in legislation is now very much up for reappraisal. I am not sure how much time will be given to this debate but, since there has been this sudden shift not only in the legislation but also in the concept behind the legislation, in my view it is a situation where a lot more time is needed for us to look at the issues that are before us.</para><para>The legislation is now before us, and we have the bill itself and the massive number of amendments that have been put before us at this late hour. The original concept was that there would be agreements between the Commonwealth and the states to set up regimes whereby different aspects of the environment could be protected, so we have the issue of the Ramsar wetland attended to, the issue of world heritage property attended to, the issue of migratory species dealt with and so on. They are dealt with in the bill itself in a way which is not sufficient because the penalties for people that breach the environmental laws that are going to come into operation if this bill is passed are not salutary enough to get a situation where people adhere to the environmental laws and the environmental spirit of Australia. Hopefully, if we get a good chance to look at these amendments, that may help but it is clear now that the whole basis of this debate has changed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>5941</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy comments today in speaking 
 to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] will specifically concentrate on the impact of the aspects of this legislation and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] on Aboriginal Territorians, especially the traditional owners of Aboriginal freehold land now leased to the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. In the Northern Territory this specifically refers to the Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu national parks.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is about a withdrawal by the Commonwealth from its environment protection role. This bill is about a withdrawal by the Commonwealth from many of its responsibilities in relation to the environment protection and biodiversity conservation in favour of the states and territories. The Commonwealth has been involved in a large number of areas of environmental protection over many decades. Existing Commonwealth environment protection and conservation legislation covers a wide range of matters, including environmental impact assessment, endangered species, heritage and national parks management, as well as giving effect to various international environmental obligations such as trade in wildlife, ozone layer protection and sea dumping.</para><para>When one looks at the government's majority finding from the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the bill that we are now considering, it seems that the government has been fairly dismissive of indigenous concerns. I have to say that I was rather surprised at the response in the government's majority report because a quick look at the transcript of the committee hearings and the various submissions provided to the committee gives an indication of how concerned indigenous people are about the impact of these bills.</para><para>I met recently with the traditional owners of both the boards of management from the Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu national parks and they have left me in no doubt about the intensity of their concerns. What are those concerns? One thing that was raised time and again was the view of these indigenous people that there has been no real consultation 
 regarding those aspects of the bill which would impact upon them, despite assurances given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, that he would do so. We heard again today his pretence in question time about those so-called consultations. Aboriginal people seem quite confused about why Senator Hill was not prepared to do what he promised to do, and that is talk with themânot to themâin a meaningful way before he proceeded with any plans to do anything that changed the joint management arrangements. Perhaps it is because Senator Hill's idea of consultation differs from that of the traditional owners.</para><para>Evidence was presented to the inquiry on 17 March this year when it was stated that Senator Hill met with the Kakadu board on 4 April 1996. The inquiry heard that Senator Hill advised the board that any future changes to the joint management arrangements would only be made with the agreement of the traditional owners. Despite requests by the board to be involved in discussions regarding any review of the joint management areas in Kakadu, the Aboriginal owners have told me that Senator Hill has not consulted with them about the proposed changes in any meaningful way. Senator Hill clearly seems to be under the impression that telling people what changes will be imposed upon them amounts to consultation. He is wrong.</para><para>Key indigenous concerns include: changes to the joint management arrangements; imposition of Northern Territory government representation on the joint boards of management; disregard for Aboriginal culture and intellectual property rights; and the fact that there is no equivalent of section 70 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act in the new bill. Mick Alderson, the chairperson of the Kakadu board of management, speaking at the inquiry hearing in Darwin in March said:</para><para>Please remember that most of the Kakadu Aboriginal land is private land. We are the landowners, but we are landowners with a difference. We are landowners that have agreed with the people of Australia to share our country with all Australians. This is why we feel offended that this government has tried to change the management structure on our land without talking to us and without us 
 saying yes or no to these changes. It is disrespectful and rude.</para><para>He also said:</para><para>It does not happen to other private landowners. Our ancestors have lived on our land for 60,000 years. We should have been respected as landowners and consulted about any changes.</para><para>Those feelings reflect the confusion and the hurt that is currently being experienced by the traditional owners who entered into the joint management agreement with the Commonwealth via the director of national parks in good faith. The current leases agreement between the traditional owners and the director of national parks to establish Kakadu National Park was signed in October 1978. For Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, the current joint management arrangements were established in 1986. In agreeing to a lease, the traditional owners said very clearly that they wanted a central role in the management of the park alongside the director.</para><para>So what is Senator Hill trying to achieve by imposing changes to the joint management arrangements and why is he putting the people's and the public's access to Kakadu and Uluru at risk? The joint management agreements were established under the terms of a 99-year lease governed by section 14C of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and, of course, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The joint management arrangements are nationally and internationally recognised as representing best practice in the fields of cultural and natural resource management because the current joint management arrangements involve the traditional owners in all aspects of natural and cultural resource management.</para><para>In 1995 the park was awarded the prestigious UNESCO Picasso gold medal for outstanding management in cooperation with the traditional Aboriginal owners. However, the current minister for the environment, Senator Hill, seems determined to change the arrangements, whether or not he has the agreement of the traditional landowners and regardless of what impact it might have on the public access to both of these parks.</para><para>An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Thursday, 29 April, titled `Bill warning over Kakadu', included 
 comments from a barrister who has prepared advice for the Northern Land Council and the Kakadu board of management about whether the proposed changes would constitute a breach of the lease. The barrister, Mr Robert Blowes, was quoted as saying that the new legislation in its present form would be inconsistent with the lease and detrimental to the traditional owners, putting at risk the 99-year lease between the traditional owners and the Commonwealth government. Why then is Senator Hill prepared to jeopardise this relationship, something which is valued by both Australians and overseas visitors alike?</para><para>If the traditional landowners decided the lease arrangements with the Commonwealth government were no longer valid, as a result of the unilateral changes being imposed on them by Senator Hill, then the Northern Territory's tourism industry would be dealt a heavy blow. The traditional landowners could, as would be their right as private landownersâwhich is something that this government continually forgets or does not want to know about, that is, the rights of indigenous peopleâdecline to allow public access to their property.</para><para>Tourism in the Northern Territory is the second largest industry after the minerals industry and is worth around $700 million annually to the Northern Territory. It is based on Aboriginal art and culture and on the environment. Tourism operators in the Territory are very concerned about the belligerent attitude of Senator Hill in regard to his dealings with the owners of Kakadu and Uluru. Paul Styles from the Northern Territory branch of the Tourism Council said in evidence to the Senate's inquiry into this bill on 17 March this year:</para><para>We are concernedâ</para><para>that is the Tourism Councilâ</para><para>that progress on this bill is continuing without the support of the traditional owners of the two Commonwealth-run national parks within the Northern Territory, and that that has resulted in a breakdown of trust between the boards of those two parks and the federal minister. The tourism industry is concerned that that is occurring, and, of itself, is beginning to create some uncertainty about the future of those parks. We are assured and are 
 confident that the traditional owners do not wish to see an end to the public enjoyment of the parks.</para><para>In that respect, Mr Styles is right. There has been a breakdown of trust between the boards of those two parks and the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, who just does not seem able to understand the importance of the joint management arrangements for the traditional owners. Joanne Willmot, Chair of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board of Management, described joint management as being supported by four legs: the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the park lease and the park's plan of management. But the federal government is threatening the very existence of the joint management arrangements by chopping off one of those legs.</para><para>When the Uluru-Kata Tjuta board of management was established on 10 December 1985, the Northern Territory government was entitled to a seat on that board. However, in a fit of pique over the hand-back of the land to the traditional owners, that government refused to make a nomination. It is no secret that the Northern Territory government wants ultimate management control over Uluru and Kakadu. However, this is something which understandably is resisted by the traditional owners, knowing the Northern Territory government's patronising attitude to indigenous Territorians. Senator Hill has claimed that it is necessary to have a Territory representative on the board in order to build a more constructive relationship between the Northern Territory government and indigenous people. Also, the minister has said it would be an opportunity for funds to be properly directed to essential services for residents of Uluru and Kakadu.</para><para>Handing over of management control to the Northern Territory government would cancel the effect of the hand-back of Uluru and Kakadu, even if traditional owners retained formal title. To suggest that NT representation on the boards of management would assist with the provision of services is, in itself, a damning indictment on the Territory government for its failure to provide essential services and infrastructure to indigenous people 
 living at Mutitjulu, Jabiru or elsewhere in the parks.</para><para>The Northern Territory government does not provide local government services and infrastructure to the Mutitjulu community located in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Parkâsomething that is probably not widely known, particularly by members of the federal government. Essential services are provided by Parks Australia. Nor does the Territory government provide local government servicesâroads, footpaths, rubbish collectionâoutside of Jabiru. That is a town located within Kakadu National Park. The provision of essential services and infrastructure by the Northern Territory government should not be tied or linked to NT government representation on the board of management.</para><para>As Senator Margetts has suggested, it seems that the greater the contribution of indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, the fewer the resources the Northern Territory government makes available for basic human services; or, the more a community earns, the more you are expected to be self-reliant and fewer government resources go into your community. It should also be remembered that the Northern Territory government opposed world heritage listing for both Kakadu and Uluru and advocates mining in Kakadu. Now though, it seems they are quite keen to get their hands on the joint management committee.</para><para>There is no equivalent of section 70 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 in the current bill. That section assures traditional owners that their rights prevail over non-Aboriginal conservation interests, within proper limits. It should come as no surprise that there is no duplication of this section in the new bill. It allowed traditional owners the right to continue hunting and gathering on the land and in the sea. It is in their lease agreement and they want it written in law as well. However, under the proposed legislation, the minister will have to be satisfied that `the action is of particular significance in indigenous tradition'. Aboriginal people have pointed out that they know the right times to hunt and how much they can take, and that it is in their interests to 
 look after and sustain biodiversity. In fact, they probably know that better than any non-Aboriginal person we know of.</para><para>Access to biological resources is an important issue for Aboriginal traditional owners. Aboriginal people have expressed concern that there is insufficient protection given in the bill to prevent the appropriation by pharmaceutical companies of indigenous biological knowledge, without acknowledgment or compensation, for significant industrial and commercial gain. Section 301 simply leaves control of access to biological resources in Commonwealth areas to regulationâand ignores non-Commonwealth areas altogetherâand is unlikely to address their concerns. Indigenous people, whose human, plant and animal genetic and scientific resources are being collected and studied by geneticists, should be involved in policy development in this area.</para><para>Another key concern indicated by indigenous people was the proposal to repeal the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. This would have repealed the statutory position of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. Recently, on 25 May, the minister announced that he had done a backflip and had decided to retain the statutory position of the Commonwealth Director of National Parks and Wildlife. Having just received the numerous amendments this afternoon, many of us have probably not had time to see whether that commitment is translated into fact. However, questions remain about the role and resources of that position.</para><para>Jabiru is crown land vested in the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, and this bill seeks to weaken indigenous control over the township of Jabiru, which is situated in Kakadu National Park. The town lease, the Kakadu plan of management and the Jabiru town plan regulate development of the town. The bill seeks to weaken the limited control over management and future development of Jabiru that traditional owners currently enjoy through the board of management. It seeks to weaken its role in the development of the plan of management and the influence of the board on the decisions of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife.</para><para>The bill makes no provision for what happens in Jabiru when there is no plan of management in force, and it weakens existing arrangements that limit the capacity for the government to remove Jabiru from the park. Any weakening of the control of the development, expansion and ownership of Jabiru would have a detrimental effect on the national park, the environment, the biodiversity and the local Aboriginal people.</para><para>In conclusion, I put on the record that there are many areas of the bill which affect not only indigenous people in the Northern Territory but the Northern Territory as a whole. Time prevents me from going through each of those, but the essence of my speech today is to point out that indigenous people in the Northern Territory are not happy with the proposed changes and they are not happy with the lack of consultation regarding these changes. Indigenous people have a better understandingâbetter than any Australiansâof the importance of the environment. It is part of their life. They depend on the land. They live it and they enact it each day. This legislation does not recognise that role that indigenous Australians play and the role that they maintain in achieving good conservation outcomes. Therefore, as part of the ALP's position, I will be strongly opposing this legislation in its current form.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>5945</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not think it is an overstatement to say that this <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  represents a landmark for environment legislation in Australia. We said when it first emerged that it needed major surgery. It was full of loopholes. There was too much discretion for the minister and too high a risk of devolving decision making to the states on matters of national significance. Well, a Senate inquiry, hundreds of submissions, hearings in almost all states and more than 400 amendments later, that surgery is complete. I might say that that surgery would not have been possible on the floorâtrying to juggle so many amendments. I welcome the government's willingness to take on board the concerns of conservation groups, ordinary citizens, indigenous Australians and the 
 Australian Democrats. We could have walked away from this legislation. That would have been the easy path to choose. Instead, we chose to do the hard yards and to be at the negotiating table. I think we have played a constructive role and achieved an outcome which is far better than the status quo and far far better than the original legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I summarise the key points that our role in this negotiation will lead to: more effective protection for world heritage areas, Ramsar wetlands of international importance, threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species, whales and dolphins, and the marine environment; approvals processes remaining under Commonwealth auspices, and public consultation and transparency instead of secretly negotiated bilateral agreements with the states; recognition of more threatening processes, more triggers for environmental assessment being added through a public review process, and greater accountability through audited processes and strong enforcement measures; greater consideration being given to indigenous people's role and interests in the protection of the environment and conservation of biodiversity. So our bottom line in this legislation has been the best environment outcome, and I think we have achieved that.</para><para>I go first of all to the objects of the act and ecologically sustainable development. The community and all levels of government have recognised ESD as an important national goal, but much more needs to be done to make this goal a reality. The objects of the bill and the bill as a whole represent a major advance in this area. Firstly, the promotion of ecologically sustainable development is an explicit object of the bill. The amended bill also includes a definition of ESD which we consider reflects a good balance between environmental, economic and social considerations. These principles will apply to key decisions under the act, such as the granting of approvals following environmental impact assessment. This will give new life to the concept of ESD and ensure that ESD is applied in decision making, not only by the Commonwealth government but also by businesses putting forward development proposals. In 
 contrast, the current legislation, showing its age, includes almost no mention of ESD. In fact, I think the only act in which ESD is mentioned is the Endangered Species Protection Act of 1992.</para><para>We also support amendments to the objectives that explicitly recognise the role of indigenous people in the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity and recognise indigenous people's knowledge, which can provide a significant contribution to the conservation of biodiversity. For example, in the Uluru National Park, Aboriginal knowledge has been important in undertaking biodiversity surveys, and Aboriginal knowledge and practices relating to fire management have been incorporated into the burning strategy to maintain the diversity and mosaic of vegetation. Indigenous knowledge relating to the medicinal pharmacological, food and other values of Australia's biological resources could also lead to important products of commercial and social value. The recognition of the need for a partnership approach to environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, including through conservation agreements with land-holders and community involvement in management planning, is consistent with the community's desire to be directly involved in environmental management and the interest expressed by many individuals and organisations during the Senate inquiry into the bill to be involved in the implementation of this bill.</para><para>Going on to matters of national environmental significance, we very much welcome the designation of world heritage properties, Ramsar wetlands, threatened species and ecological communities, internationally protected migratory species, the marine environment and nuclear actions as matters of national environment significance. These are matters which should trigger the environment assessment and approval process, as they are clearly of national or international significance for which the federal government must be responsible.</para><para>We sought the inclusion of criminal offences for breaches which involve taking actions with a significant impact on matters 
 of national environment significance without appropriate approvals. We consider that the criminal penalties proposed in the amendmentsâthat is, up to seven years imprisonment and/or $460,200 for individualsâare appropriate, given the national significance of these matters. The minister will not be able to approve the construction or operation of nuclear facilities, such as nuclear fuel fabrication plants and nuclear power plants.</para><para>A significant amendment will provide for reviews every five years on whether the operation of the act should be extended and on the addition of new triggers. This will be a public process, with public input being sought before preparation of a review report commences and with public comments being sought on the draft report. This will ensure public consultation and transparency in the evolution of the Commonwealth's triggers for the environmental assessment and approval process. The proposed amendments will not limit the minister's ability to add new triggers at any time to deal with environmental challenges that are not foreseen or adopted through the review process.</para><para>Going on to conservation agreements, the proposed amendments will remove any exemptions from the environment assessment and approval process through conservation agreements. This amendment will ensure that even where a conservation agreement exists, approvals will have to be sought for any activity which is regulated by this bill.</para><para>On the question of bilateral agreements and declarations, the bill provides for the environment minister to accredit state environment assessment and approval processes through bilateral agreements and Commonwealth processes through declarations. The proposed amendments deliver enhanced safeguards relating to accreditation which we very strongly support. In particular, bilateral agreements will be developed with full transparency and public consultation, with the minister notifying his or her intention to prepare a bilateral agreement and seeking public comments on a draft agreement, and publishing finalised agreements.</para><para>Before entering a bilateral agreement, the minister will need to consider the role and 
 interests of indigenous peoples in promoting the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources in the context of the agreement, taking into account Australia's relevant obligations under the biodiversity convention. The safeguards for declarations accrediting Commonwealth processes have been brought into line with those applying to bilateral agreements accrediting state processes. States and Commonwealth agencies will be accredited to grant approvals only in accordance with management plans which are in force under state or Commonwealth law and which have been accredited by the Commonwealth environment minister.</para><para>The minister may accredit a management plan only if satisfied that the plan accords with the objects of the act; that the plan and the relevant state or Commonwealth law meet criteria specified in the regulations; that there has been or will be adequate assessment of the impacts of actions approved in accordance with the plan; that actions approved in accordance with the management plan will not have unacceptable or unsustainable impacts on matters of national environment significance; that the plan is not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the treaties dealing with world heritage, Ramsar, biodiversity and migratory species; that a plan dealing with world heritage and Ramsar sites is consistent with Australian world heritage and Ramsar management principles; and that the plan has been tabled in both Houses of Parliament and has not been disallowed. In other words, the only delegation of Commonwealth approvals is  itself subject to the scrutiny of the parliament.</para><para>The proposed amendments require the making of regulations which specify criteria for accredited management plans. Bilateral agreements will include a provision recognising that the Commonwealth Auditor-General may undertake audits relating to the agreement. State assessment processes which are accredited on a project-by-project basis must be carried out under state law, and both the process and the law must meet standards specified in mandatory regulations. Consistent with the wishes of the traditional owners of Kakadu, Uluru and Booderee National Parks, 
 bilateral agreements will not apply to these parks.</para><para>These safeguards provide the public with greater confidence in the concept of accrediting state and Commonwealth agencies to fulfil responsibilities for matters of national environment significance. The proposed amendments address a major concern expressed about the bill, that only impacts on matters of national environment significance would be addressed. It was assumed that the states and territories would address the impacts of a proposal on matters of state or local significance.</para><para>However, with the proposed amendments, the bill will require that states and territories accredited to assess or approve proposals relating to matters of national environment significance must also ensure that other environmental issues are addressed. In addition, the Commonwealth environment minister must not approve proposals before receiving a notice from the relevant state or territory stating that impacts on matters of state or local significance have been assessed to the greatest extent practicable. These proposed amendments will ensure that no environmental matter falls between the cracks.</para><para>Going on to assessment and approval processes, the proposed amendments will require the minister to publish all referrals and to seek public comment on whether the referred action should be subject to environmental assessment and approval. The minister must consider public comments received on the referrals. This amendment introduces public consultation and strengthens accountability in the screening of proposals, which is a crucial step in the assessment process.</para><para>An important consideration in the screening of proposals is whether an action has a `significant impact' on the matter protected by the bill. During the Senate inquiry into the bill, concerns were raised by various stakeholder groups about the meaning of `significant impact'. We are pleased to see that the amended bill will provide for regulations which set out matters to be taken into account when determining whether an action has a significant impact. This will provide addition 
 al guidance and certainty to the community, as well as to the environment minister.</para><para>Public consultation will now be mandatory for all assessments conducted on the basis of preliminary documentationâcurrently an often used form of assessment which does not involve a public environmental report, environmental impact statement or inquiry. The proposed amendments provide that important safeguards to claims of commercial confidentiality in relation to assessment documentation are genuine. The onus will be on persons claiming commercial confidentiality to prove the basis of the claim against criteria spelled out in the amendments.</para><para>Currently, the bill proposes that the minister be able to revoke an approval where a breach of conditions has resulted in a significant impact on the matter protected by the bill, or where the predicted impacts have underestimated the actual impacts of a proposal. We support the proposed amendments to extend this capacity to include situations where the minister believes that certain or likely impacts were not accurately identified in the assessment process, either deliberately or due to negligence.</para><para>The provision for strategic assessment of policies, plans and programs is a step forward for environmental assessment legislation. The Democrats support the mandatory strategic assessment of fisheries without current management plans. We are conscious that no public environmental report or environmental impact statement has been prepared for any fishery under the current Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The proposed amendments to the provisions on strategic assessment will ensure that public comment is sought and taken into account in developing the terms of reference for any assessments, as well as in preparation of the assessment report.</para><para>An innovative provision proposed in the amendments, and negotiated by the Democrats, relates to the weekly publication on the Internet of information on environmental assessmentsâthat is, clause 170A. This will provide a clearing house of information which will be extremely useful to members of the community who wish to be notified of refer 
 rals, the availability of assessment documentation and reports, invitations for public comment and relevant decisions by the minister. Traditional media will, of course, continue to be employed for these purposes for members of the public who do not have access to the Internet.</para><para>In terms of enforcement, the Democrats note that the bill and proposed amendments provide a comprehensive, consistent and effective enforcement system. There is now a wide range of enforcement options available to the Commonwealth to deal with non-compliance such as criminal offences and penalties, directed environmental audits, conservation orders for threatened species in Commonwealth areas, injunctions, appropriate third party standing provisions for judicial review and injunctions, civil penalties, liability of executive officers of corporations, infringement notices, the capacity to publicise contraventions and liability for loss or damage arising from a contraventions. These provisions will provide the `teeth' that are sorely lacking in much of the existing legislation which is to be replaced by the bill.</para><para>As a result of amendments negotiated by the Democrats, criminal offences will now complement the civil penalties in the billâit is appropriate that jail terms are available to deal with the worst offences, particularly those relating to matters of international and national environmental significanceâand the capacity of the minister to require an independent environmental audit is widened to include situations where the minister suspects that the actual or likely impacts of an action authorised by an environmental authority are significantly greater than indicated in the information available to the minister when the authority was granted.</para><para>We are very pleased with the proposed amendments which will require, for the first time, Commonwealth departments, authorities, companies and agencies to report on their performance in achieving ecologically sustainable development. We believe that this mandatory requirement will reinvigorate the Commonwealth's commitment to implement ESD and establish greater accountability for environmental performance. We also support 
 the proposed amendment requiring state of the environment reporting every five years.</para><para>State of the environment reporting is a powerful tool for informing the public about their environment. Importantly, state of the environment reports assist decision makers and the community to protect and conserve the environment. Although the first national state of the environment report was published in 1996 without legislation, the amended bill will provide greater certainty that future reports will be prepared. We support regular review of the operation and effectiveness of the act and we are pleased to see the proposed amendment requiring such reviews. My colleague Senator Andrew Bartlett will complete the description of the amendments and the bill itself in his speech in the second reading debate. I conclude my comments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>5949</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat we have just heard is a total failure to explain the Democrats' central role in the most disgusting sell-out of the Australian environment and laws to protect the Australian environment that this Senate chamber has ever seen. I guess that is why Senator Allison has just left the chamber, and there is not one Democrat in here to defend their role in this sell-out of the Australian environment. It is absolutely gobsmacking that the Democrats, who have always touted themselves as saviours of the Franklin River, who have claimed that they were the protectors of the Daintree Rainforest, Kakadu, Fraser Island and Australia's environment in general, have, for a place at the Howard table of powerâfleeting as that may beâgiven their tawdry imprimatur to this 400-page document which, if it had been in place 30 years ago, would have seen the Franklin flooded by the Democrats, the Daintree logged by the Democrats, and Fraser Island and much more of Kakadu mined by the Democrats. All of this for a small place at the table of Howard power in 1999.</para></talk.start><para>Some environmentalists who were very unpractised at the way that power works in this place were sucked into this downward Democrat vortex, which takes Australia's environmental laws down the plughole. However, the major environmental groups feel 
 differently. They were not at the table, and they are not satisfied with environmental crumbs. They stayed in contact with their constituency and they stayed true to principle, which is something the Democrats have totally failed to do. In the press release from the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace Australia and the Wilderness Society this afternoon, these groups said that this deal does not address the major environmental problems with the government's bill; that is, the Democrats' deal. We are not convinced that the dangerous thrust of this bill, which hands powers to the states, has been turned around.</para><para>The representatives of the Australian environment movement and millions of Australians who depend on them for holding the line on the environment, said this to the Democrats:</para><para>The struggles of thousands of environmentalists to expand Commonwealth powers at Fraser Island, the Franklin Dam, the Great Barrier Reef and the Wet Tropics must not be in vain. The 400 amendments to the bill must not be rushed. They should be put on the table so that Australians who love their country can have a look.</para><para>What do we have instead? Instead, we have one softly spoken, totally unconvincing Democrat senator, Senator Allison, fleeing the Senate straight after her contribution because she knows that, when she spoke about this legislation giving Australians `full transparency', to quote her, and public consultation, she was not prepared to make that stand herself. For the last few months, she and other environmental quislings have been at the table of this anti-environmental government selling out.</para><para>Full transparency, my foot! Public consultation: none of it. The Australian Democrats are no longer worthy of the name of their party. Democrats, my foot! They are involved in backroom deals because they like the position at the table of power, as Senator Allison put it at her press conference today. To do that, they are prepared to throw transparency out the window.</para><para>Indeed, just this morning, the same Senator Allison told the nation on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program that there was no deal. At 1 o'clock today, she and her shameful colleagues were at a 
 press conference enumerating the hundreds of amendments that the government has now brought in here on their behalf, ostensibly to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. What they have is a sow of a purse. This nation, through successive economic rationalist governments, has decided that matters of trade and economics and, therefore, employmentâmeasures to protect the national interest under the Constitution, such as tariffsâwill be dismantled and given across to the altar of international trade agreements. When it comes to the environment, we go the other direction. We turn our back on international agreements and hand the powers back to the states and territories. We give them to not just any state and territory but the whole lot of them.</para><para>In future, the great environmental issues of the day in Australia will be determined by what are called bilateral agreements. These are bilateral sell-outs of the environment, and I will tell you why. They involve the federal government entering into an agreement about such things as forests with the state and territory governments involved. It is a process of the lowest common denominator dictating national policy.</para><para>Let us look at the one set of bilateral agreements already in place. These are the so-called regional forest agreements already signed for parts of Victoria, for all of Tasmania and for all of Western Australia, where there has been almost a revolution over this issue. When the Democrats say that they are serving the popular good, they ought to look at the Western Australian situation, where 87 per cent of people want the loggers out of the wild forests. However, because of this bilateral agreement process, the loggers have been given a licence to continue cutting over the next 20 years into thousands of hectares of the great jarrah, karri and other forests, their magnificent wildlife and their ecosystems in Western Australia. When it comes to Tasmania, world heritage value forests are being cut under these bilateral agreements as we sit here today.</para><para>The Democrats now endorse regional forest agreements because they endorse this legislation and the bilateral component of it. To make this point to the Democrats, at question 
 time today, I asked the minister accredited with being for the environment but who I maintain is against it, Senator Robert Hill, about page 9 of this 400-page document. It says that any company that takes an action which is even likely to have a significant impact on world heritage values shall be liable to a penalty of $5.5 million. That sounds like real environmental teeth. However, because of the bilateral agreement endorsed by the Democrats, that logging, which the government's own advisers have said has a significant adverse effect on the current world heritage area, is going to proceed a la Democrat philosophy.</para><para>Moreover, under this bilateral agreement now endorsed by the Democrats, if the federal government were to make any move in the next 20 years to protect those world heritage values, to protect the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere, to protect the rare and endangered white goshawk or Tasmanian wedge tailâdown to 200 breeding pairs each and dependent on forests in Tasmaniaâmassive compensation would have to be paid to the woodchip corporations, which never paid a cent for those forests. There is no compensation for workers and no compensation for other industries such as tourism, which has more jobs dependent on forests in Tasmania than the woodchippers, but the woodchippers have the bilateralâstate-federalâagreement, and the Democrats have endorsed that here today.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">BARTLETT</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>âRubbish!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âSenator Bartlett from Queensland says, `Rubbish.' This sell-out of the forests of Tasmania by Senator Bartlett is underscored by his own pathetic effort to somehow or other say, `Further down the line we can undo this.' He endorses the destruction of world heritage value forests, wild habitats and ecosystems around this country, and he says, `Well, we couldn't get an arrangement different from that with the government so we went along with the government. We're going to get this legislation through this parliament.' And then, weak-kneed, pathetic and quisling-like, these Democrats are going to bring in an amendment outside that government agreement and are 
 going to ask Labor, the Greens and the Independents to endorse it, knowing full well that any amendment made outside the agreement at the Howard tableâwhere they have been fronting up and feeling falsely powerful as they were done in in the last few daysâis going to be blocked in the House of Representatives. They know that, and they know that no matter what is done in the Senate outside this agreement, which Senator Bartlett will forever be remembered for because I'll make sure he is as the environment goes down the stream, it has no chance of being amended outside that table of power they supped at as they sold out the environment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>They talk about recovering in the coming months those things which are not in this legislation.

They do not understand that it does not matter what they bring in here; they have now sold their power out. Anything that goes through this place will be blocked in the House of Representatives, where the Democrats do not have any representatives.</para><para>What will happen in the next 12 months is that the government will say, `We've got our Democrat licence legislation. The Democrats have now given their stamp of approval to the regional forest agreements, which over the next 20 years are going to see the destruction of millions of hectares of Australia's natural forests and their wildlife habitats. We will go next to bilateral agreements on a whole range of other issuesânuclear issues, global warming, rivers, biodiversity and the things the Democrats left out.' But they will strike these agreements without the Democrats at the table. The government, with a chainsaw under each arm, will be at the table with the Premier of Tasmania, with Premier Court in Western Australia and with the new Chief Minister in the Northern Territory.</para><para>Who is going to defend the environment at that table with these Democrat puppies shut out? They certainly are not going toâbecause they have sold out now; they have sold their power out. Do you know what they are going to do next, Mr Acting Deputy President? They are going to come in here, at the behest of the government, and bring the guillotine down on the debate of this monumental environmental issue. The Labor Party, for one, have some 300 amendments to try to fix the unfixable. The Democrats do not want to 
 debate that; they want to get through their GST legislation, with its environmental destructiveness and social inequality. That is the big game for themâthis is an add-on. But Australia and its environment, and this nation, are going to have to live with this perfidy by the Democratsâthese people who, in my submission, do not deserve to be here doing thisâfor decades to come.</para><para>These weasels, who have sold out their electorate of just last October, did not tell the electorate membership, did not tell the Democrats, that they were going to sell out comprehensively on their environmental principlesâthe same as they sold out on social justice through the GST.

Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I remember sitting through some of the hearings on this legislation and the references that were dealing with 
 which way the Australian parliament should go, and which way the Australian people should go, in handling environmental issues. Without doubt, the Democrat representatives on that committee were very, very strong in wanting to strengthen the federal government's role in establishing environmental policy, outcomes and delivery in Australia. I have to say that I argued completely in favour of that position. Ideologically, some people might say I am an old-style centralist, but I actually believe I am an Australian first before I am a South Australian. I believe that, environmentally, you must have policies for the whole of this continent, and the best way to deliver them is through the national parliament, which is responsible to all the Australian people.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">LIGHTFOOT</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>âCentralise everything.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âNot centralise everything, Senator Lightfoot. But let me point out to you that I am as concerned about the environment in the Kimberleys of your state as I am about the Flinders Ranges in my own state and the Franklin River in Tasmaniaâbecause I am an Australian, I am in the Australian parliament and all of those areas are represented in this parliament. The best environmental policies have been delivered out of this parliament. Some of the most controversial issues on the environment have been delivered from this parliamentâfrom these two chambers. And I thank goodness that we have succeeded in changing the perception that the environment is just a states' issue, constitutionally left to the states.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Through a mixture of the powers that are available to the Commonwealth of Australia through the Constitution, we have been able to insist that there be decent outcomes. For example, Fraser Island would be mined to nothing now if not for the fact that the Fraser government used its export powers to stop giving permits to export the sand from Fraser Island. That was an excellent long-term outcome that, economically, is important for that region of the central coast of Queensland because of the tourist potential of Fraser Island, which is now a world icon environmentally. </para><para>It was the Fraser governmentâI am mentioning the Fraser government because recognition and credit should be given where they are dueâthat took the decision to ban whaling. I happen to know that in your state, Senator Lightfoot, Albany in the south-west was one of the last whaling places left. There was an industry there and some people lost their jobs. There is no argument that those decisions that were taken affected people in Albany and in Western Australia. But can anyone say now that the decision to ban whaling was wrong?</para><para>In my own state, the economic regeneration of the south coast around Victor Harbor every winter is astonishing. Why? Because people come every weekend and during the week in their tens of thousands to see the whales. They spend money locally in small businesses. It has been the economic saviour of this region. People are going out on the Eyre Highway to see the whales now breeding at the top of the Bight. Those decisions of the Fraser government, supported by the Labor Party at the time, have led to major economic benefitsâfar outweighing the few jobs that may have been lost at Albany when we closed the whaling station. But that was a national decision. If it had been left to the state government of Western Australia to close the Albany whaling station, they would never have done it. If it had been left to the Queensland government to stop the logging of the Daintree rainforestâthe tropical rainforest of the northâthey would never have done it.</para><para>We all remember here in this chamber when Senator Richardson, the minister who got the world heritage listing for the tropical rainforests of North Queensland, was abused by the National Party of Queensland, who said that he was costing jobs at Ravenshoe. And that was the attack. You could not imagine a National Party government of Queensland taking the same decision. Now everybody says that this was a touch of genius because the growth of the tourist industry in Cairns and North Queensland, based on people wanting to see natural rainforest, has more than outweighed the jobs lost by the closure of some sawmills. Again, it was a national decision. </para><para>The one of all icon decisions was, of course, the Franklin River. At the 1983 elections we said, `We will go to ban it. We will use our national treaty powers to say, "You can't dam the Franklin River".' I think a lot of people voted for the Labor Party at that election because they did not want to see one of the last great wild rivers of the world turned into another concrete dam.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Lightfoot interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âI note the interjection from Senator Lightfoot, who, I accept, is a strong state righter. He has always argued that position since he has been here, and I understand that, when he was a member of the Western Australian parliament, he took a very strong pro-Western Australian viewâa states' rights view. I think he is wrong. We would argue ideologically that we have a difference of opinion. I am arguing here to him that saving the Franklin River would not have occurred if we had relied on a state Labor or Liberal government in Tasmania. It wrecked the Labor Party for a decade. I think we went down to no seats in Tasmania over this issue federally. For a decade, we were nearly wiped out at the state level. But now we have in the south-west of Tasmania a wild river that is recognised around the world as one of the great natural wildernesses to be enjoyed by future generations forever.</para></talk.start></continue><para>And there is another area, I would say to you, Senator Lightfoot, and to others. I remember in 1989-90 debating in this parliament the future of Antarctica. We declared that the whole of Antarctica should be an international wilderness area free from mining or exploitation forever. Some people said that was too radical at the time. In the end I think we even got bipartisan support. This parliament took a national and international decision that brought great credit to this country and to this parliament. You cannot rely on states to do that. They will never have a national view or even an international view.</para><para>Therefore, we come to this bill. I have not had a chance to read the Democrat amendments to this bill in detail. They have put out a press release. I have to say that I find it astonishing that the Democrats would put this out as a deal in the last week of the federal 
 parliament before we adjourn for the winter break. They have every opportunity to tell the government, `Go jump; we will not deal with this bill until we come back in August.' Why aren't their amendments being circulated to the broad environmental community, the Australian community, over the next two months so that there can be proper discussion? I suspect that, at some stage tonight or first thing tomorrow morning, the Democrats will vote with the government to guillotine and gag this bill through. When they doâI have to agree with Senator Brownâit will be a shameful day for the Democrats. It will be the end of their credentials as a mainstream environmentally sensitive party if they gag this bill and their amendments through before people have had time to scrutinise them.</para><para>They skiteâto use a good old Australian termâin their statement that they have 400 amendments to the government's billâtabled today, voted on tomorrow. I will bet two bob to London Bridge or the Sydney Harbour Bridge that there are mistakes in these amendments; that they will be back here in six months time saying, `Oops, sorry, we didn't realise what that meant,' because this has been done in haste as part of the deal and how Mr Howardâand I congratulate him in one sense on thisâhas traduced the leadership of the Democrats. He has tickled their belly and called them across. `Want to be at the main table?' he says, and Senator Lees says, `Oh, thank you very much; I now feel important. I'll vote.

No wonder we are seeing revolts in the Democrat party all around Australiaâthey cannot believe it. The GST deal, I suspect, was bad enough for them, but the Democrats, who have prided themselves on their environmental credentials, have told their own supporters, who are overwhelmingly strong environmentalists, that they have done this deal and will have it voted on in 24 hours, before even their own membership sees the list of these 400 amendments.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What I also find interesting about this press statement is that it has a photograph of all the Democrat team up the top and then over the page they have had to go to the trouble of getting all the Democrat senators to sign it. Does this mean that there was trouble in the camp about getting agreement and that all the disputes meant that they had to force people to sign and have their photographs up the top? I would have thought this statement was issued either by Senator Meg Lees, as the Leader of the Democrats, or by Senator Lyn Allison, the spokesperson on the environment. Why did Meg Lees and Lyn Allison need to have the photos of all the other Democrats up the top and all their signatures on this statement? It means that they know that there is big strife inside the party about it, and they are trying to show there is some unity. It is clearly a forced unity when you have to get down to doing this.</para><para>We saw yesterday another example of how the Democrats have been traduced by this Prime Minister, in the way they did not use any of their negotiating position to stop the sale of Telstra being guillotined and gagged through this parliament.

The Democrats say, as you read through this statement, that they have strengthened it. It says, `Democrats deliver expansion of Commonwealth environmental powers.'

 federal government's power over environmental policy.</para><para>I suspect there are a lot of Liberal Party and National Party members, including Senator Lightfoot, who will be delighted with this package because there are arrangements to go back to the states in these so-called bilateral agreements. As I understand the way it readsâand no-one has explained to me why I am wrong about what I am about to sayâunder such a measure the Franklin River back in 1983 would have been dammed, the Daintree would have been woodchipped and Fraser Island would have been mined. Maybe we could still have stopped the hunting of whales, because that was in international waters, but a number of those major environmental initiatives, which everybody in Australia, except the last couple of diehards, and everybody internationally now recognise as a great achievement, would not have occurred.</para><para>I cannot see in the statement, in the time I have had it, how the Democrats can prove otherwise. They say they have strengthened certain administrative arrangements, et cetera. That is a pig in a poke, to use the old saying. How can you guarantee administrative arrangements once the legislation is through? The Senator Lightfoots of the world, who state their position openly and up-front, are not going to traduce the rules. Will Meg Lees be welcomed into Senator Hill's office or the office of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources to discuss environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions? Of course not. Once the bill goes through, the phone will be silent.

All of these arrangements are not going to be locked in. Loopholes will be in existence. How could the Democrats draft 400 amendments in a few days and not 
 be willing to have them out as an exposure draft to their own constituency? This amazes me. As I said to one rank and file Democrat supporter earlier today, `What is your strategy? It has got me whacked. I can't work out your strategy.' If I could see they were going to get a lot of extra votes for all of this, I would say that I do not agree with the policy but politically they are going to gain support. But not only are they creating a roaring bushfire of opposition amongst their own supporters on the GST but also now on the basic area of support for the Democrats amongst environmentalists they are doing a deal with this government in a rushed way and they are going to gag it through, and the rest of the party is going to be up in arms.

I have to say cynically that this might be a good thing for the Labor Party. During the 1980s we lost a lot of voters. A lot of our supporters went to the Democrats, particularly in my state; consistently it was over 10 per cent in most elections federally. Most of them are ex-Labor voters who voted for the Labor Party in the 1960s, the 1970s and the early 1980s. I have to say that on the GST and this environment bill we have got a great opportunity to go back to those people and say, `You have been double-crossed; you have been let down.

You are dead right. This is an astonishing development today from the Democrats, as astonishing as their giving away their bargaining position over the GST. I think the last month is going to be the most devastating month in the history of the Democratsâsince they were formed in 1977 on the basis of keeping the bastards honest. We know that in one sense the Democrats have now joined one bunch of bastards and are no longer keeping them honest. It is an astonishing political development. Illegitimacy these days is not a derogatory term in many cases, but the way they have done it, they have certainly made themselves the victims of ridicule, as they deserve to be. We in the Labor Party look forward to pointing out, at the coming federal election and leading up to that, to all those long-term loyal Democrat supporters, many of them originally Labor supporters, that it is time to come home to the Labor Party, where they will get decent social justice policies and decent environmental policies.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>5956</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs we know, the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  proposes a scheme which purports to provide environmental protection.

 involving governments, the community, and landholders, and</para><para>-	 assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities.</para><para>I cannot say I have read every word in the bill, but I have got to say that this bill certainly does not do that. That is quite obvious, because the Democrats have moved probably the largest number of amendments to any piece of legislation seen in this place for a long timeâand all to do a deal with the government.</para><para>As part of the processes of this legislation you have bilateral agreements that can be developed between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. It says in division 2 of the bill, with regard to a bilateral agreement:</para><para>(2)	 A bilateral agreement is a written agreement between the Commonwealth with a State or a self governing Territory that:</para><para>(a)	 provides for one or more of the following:</para><para>(i)	 protecting the environment;</para><para>(ii)	 promoting the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources;</para><para>(iii)	 ensuring an efficient, timely and effective process for environmental assessment and approval of actions;</para><para>(iv)	 minimising duplication in the environmental assessment and approval process through Commonwealth accreditation of the processes of the State or Territory (or vice versa); and</para><para>(b)	 is expressed to be a bilateral agreement.</para><para>Look at the first part: `protecting the environment'. A number of other speakers have raised this with regard to the states' or territories' records on these issues. I do not think there would be one state that could claim that over time they have acted in the best interests of the environment.</para><para>I will speak about my own state and some of the very significant examples where state governments have not sought to act in the best interests of the environment. The Franklin River was one example that received international recognition. The Commonwealth course of action certainly was not supported by the majority of Tasmanians. As Senator Schacht said, if you ask Tasmanians the same question todayâthat is, would they support 
 that or would they notâthey definitely would support it. That is why it is important for the Commonwealth to have a very significant and senior role with regard to consideration of the environment.</para><para>We have some other bilateral type agreements that we have entered into more recently with some states. Despite the fact that I feel that those agreements, known as Regional Forest Agreements, are important for a number of reasons, they are not achieving the outcomes they were designed to achieve with respect to, in the terms of this bill, `promoting the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources'.

I hope that, when it comes to the debate in the committee stage of this bill, we will have enough time to debate some of your amendments, pathetic as they are, because you will need to explain a lot of them not only to us in this chamber but also to all the conservation minded people in this country. How are you going to see some of the things carried through? How are you going to achieve outcomes with regard to the amendments that you are moving to this totally unsatisfactory bill? For the information of Senator Bartlett, this is a bilateral agreement in another form. It just goes to show that, despite the fact that the states may be well intentioned, they do not have the capacity to always act in the best interests of the environment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Look at this government's role. It picked up the cudgels with regard to the national forest policy statement and the criteria that had been set down by usâalbeit they are probably not perfect. The negotiations it entered into in terms of bilateral agreements are the point here. We have states that have a history of not being able to act in the best interests of the environment. We have a federal government that will be involved in the negotiation of these agreements and that has a record of not negotiating in the interests of the environment. And of course we have the Democrats who have agreed to support the government.</para><para>On a few occasions I have had to agree with Senator Bob Brown. We have had many disagreements over timeâsome very significant disagreements over timeâbut I do on this occasion have to agree with the comments he made earlier. The Democrats, for all their intent and purpose and for all the reasons that they find themselves in this parliament, have certainly done themselves a disservice. They have done their constituents and supporters a disservice by going down this path and supporting the government on this occasion. Nothing can be done to this bill to make it worthy of protecting the important areas of Australia's environment.</para><para>Over the years I have had views about the fact that we need to make sure that if we are to use natural resourcesâand I have a lot of involvement in the forest industry and forestryâwe should do so in an ecologically sustainable way. We had to have many hard, long and difficult debates about those issues, but we gradually worked towards a process that could bring that about. The former federal Labor government, when it brought about the national forest policy statement, put in place a mechanism through which that could be achieved.</para><para>Since 1996 that mechanism has been changed and there has been a totally different approach. The minister comes into this chamber and says, `We have spent more money and provided more money than ever before.' So what?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Quirke interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âThat is probably true. But land clearing has not slowed down. In fact, it is not the amount of money you might provide to protect or enhance the environment, it is how you use that money and the things that you do in conjunction with the use of the money. That is where the problem lies. The government does not really have a commitment and it cannot, by its own social approach, have a commitment to the environment. That is a fact of life, as we have seen on so many occasions.</para></talk.start></continue><para> I have to sayâto give Senator Hill one bit of creditâthat, at the edges where there has been agreement to take certain steps, the government has taken one or two steps. As a 
 fisherman I have to say I was very pleased to see him take the step of actually banning the commercial fishing of blue marlin and black marlin. But, if I can go to another area of fishing, what has the government done about the issue of albatross? We have had committees and ideasâthreat abatement plans and a whole plethora of things proposed to be doneâbut at the end of the day nothing really significant is being done. It is just a lot of noise.</para><para>You can then go on to the land in terms of strategies to deal with salinity, which is a huge problem in this country. What are we doing? Very littleâwe are relying on community efforts. If you look at it, over time there have been strategies to plant a few trees here and there. If you were to analyse the expenditure there has probably been on various little plots of trees around the country and then say, `Well, look, how many of those survive today?' you would have to say it would probably be one of the biggest wastes of money of all time. That is unfortunate because I do not think the strategy has ever been right in terms of how you deal with environmental issues. They need to be taken with a more head-on approach. This government clearly does not have the commitment to do that and that is evident in this bill.</para><para>I can point to that by going to the environmental impact assessment that is supposed to be done as part of preparing for the bilateral agreement. Division 6 of the bill, `Environmental impact statements', says:</para><para>102 Minister must prepare guidelines for draft environmental impact statement</para><para>(1) The Minister must prepare written guidelinesâ</para><para>and it goes on to say what those guidelines should actually cover. They are to take account of a number of things, and the bill says:</para><para>(2) In preparing the guidelines, the Minister must seek to ensure that the draft statement will:</para><para>(a) contain enough information about the action and its relevant impacts to allow the Minister to make an informed decision whether or not to approve under Part 9 (for the purposes of each controlling provision) the taking of the action; and</para><para>(b) address any matters specified by the regulations.  
</para><para>There is no way that the minister, in terms of the bilateral agreements that are proposed to be undertaken or agreed to, will be able to make a proper assessment of all of that. The bill also allows for the establishment of committees but there is no explanation of who will be involved with regard to the environmental impact assessment committees and the various other committees that are proposed to be set upâand I think we might even give the Patagonian toothfish a run, Senator Quirke.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âPatagonian toothfish and chips!</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Bartlett interjecting</inline>â</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âI know the fact that the Democrats have taken this step with the government must hurt you, Senator Bartlett.

We get something like 108 pages of amendments, and I am not sure that it is not actually more than that because there are three pages here of additional Democrat amendments that I assume have to go with those that they have lobbed into the lap of the government to present on their behalf with its amendments.</para><para>As I said, how is Senator Bartlett going to explain what the definition is of a forestry operation that will have a `significant impact' on the environment? I would be very keen to hear Senator Bartlett's definition of a `significant impact', because I am not quite sure how 
 you then apply that. It would really be a matter of interpretation for the individual: degree of significance is in the eye of the beholder. From our point of view and my point of view, this bill does remove what was and is a very important role for the Commonwealth.</para><para>I have had arguments about Commonwealth intervention in some matters but at the end of the dayâin most, if not all, instancesâthose interventions have proven to be the right interventions. As Senator Schacht pointed out, when we were in government we did cop a lot of flak from a lot of corners in respect of that, but it was proven to be the right process. To now try and pass off the responsibility that we have had over a long time to the states, which, as we know and as I said before, have a history of not being able to act in the best interests of the environment, from a national perspective in particular, is the wrong move. It is a move that was opposed by the Democrats not that long ago; one that they used to speak about very dearly and one that they wanted the Commonwealth to maintain.

Let them get on with the job and wreck things for the future generations of this country.' That was another aspect of the bill that I found rather interesting.

It ought to be something on which they have at least the capacity to stand up and say, `We will protect one of the mainstream issues that brought us into this parliament.' That is what they ought to do. If they cannot do that, at the end of the day they will be judged by the people who put them here. If I were Senator Bartlett, I would think long and hard.

There are two key issues involved here. First of all, why are we rushing 400 amendments, I understand, through by this time tomorrow or even earlier? What is the 
 rush? Why do the Australian Democrats in particular, as has already been said, suddenly believe that this bill is so important, so acceptable in its current form, that it has to be rushed through without consultation?</para></talk.start><para>The second issue is also one of principle: what is it about the agreement between the Democrats and the government that suddenly it is acceptable to hand back powers to the states? This is something that environmentalists have worked against for years. It was fundamental in the Franklin Dam case and in the issues surrounding Fraser Island, the wet tropics in my own state and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Frankly, we have never been able to trust state governments of any political persuasion because they are much more concerned with short-term interests and are much more likely to be persuaded by developers. Look at what has happened with the Hinchinbrook Island issue and the proposal by Keith Williams. That has finally gone ahead under this government, but it would not have been stopped by a state Labor government; it would not have been stopped by a state conservative government. It could have been stopped by a federal government because federal governments are supposed to take into account, firstly, their broader responsibilities for doing the right thing by the nation and, secondly, their international obligations.</para><para>For those two reasons, I find it extraordinary that the Democrats are considering applying the guillotine tomorrow. I just do not understand it. I have many good friends who are Democrats and I know that they are amazed and do not understand what is going on. We all understand pragmatism in politics, we all understand compromise, but we do not understand a complete sell-out and doing a complete about-turn in terms of what people have always believed in.</para><para>Despite this deal, the Commonwealth has not taken responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions, forests, land clearing and water allocation. The disastrous exemptions for thoroughly discredited regional forestry agreements leave the majority of Australian forests unprotected by this law. There are still no guarantees that bilateral agreements which 
 delegate Commonwealth environmental powers to the states will not lead to a race to the bottom in environmental standards. These issues alone mean that this deal cannot be supported. With, I understand, over 400 amendments, I do not see how it is realistic to proceed. Several headlines tell the story pretty effectively: `Australia going a paler shade of green', `A green policy for the unenlightened', and `The deal not good enough for Australia's environment'.</para><para>There are a number of reasons why the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] is bad for the environment. First of all, it is the biggest rewrite of Commonwealth environmental laws for 25 years. The legislation has major problems which threaten advances in environmental law made over the last two decades. You would think that if you are having a major rewrite of a piece of legislationâany legislationâand it is the major rewrite in 25 years, you would want to take time, you would want to consult and you would want to make sure that any amendments are in the best interests of that piece of legislation.</para><para>There are five main problem areas with the bill. Commonwealth environment powers are far too narrowly defined. I have no problem with saying, `I don't trust the states.' I do not trust state governments. They are smaller, they are more parochial and are far more likely to act in a self-interested way. I say that of very good state governments. There are and have been very good state governments in Australia. Probably a condition of being a state government is that the pressure is much greater. It is like my experience in local government. It is much harder to make tough decisions in local government because your constituents are hammering down the door. It is much easier to take a more global perspective if you are at a federal level. When it comes to the environment, that is the perspective which should be being taken.</para><para>Exemptions and discretions do not allow for certainty and provide many opportunities for the Commonwealth to duck its responsibilities. That is something that I find really distressing. This government has twice gone to the people of Australia and said, `We want 
 to lead Australia. We think we know what is good for Australia.' Yet they are prepared to duck their responsibilities in relation to the environment.</para><para>Bilateral agreements facilitate a handover of Commonwealth responsibilities to the states and, frankly, I do not think any of them can be trusted with them. Ecologically sustainable development is not properly defined or taken into account and provides a poor platform for leadership in setting national standards and protecting the environment. Maybe I am being too tough on state governments, but what an ad hoc approach. Queensland might adopt some very good standards, so might Victoria and South Australia, but what happens if you do not have a national approach? It is an ad hoc approach to environmental management and I would have thought that in the last 20-odd years we would have learnt we need a coordinated, national approach.</para><para>These are not just the views of environmental groups, the Labor Party and the Greens. I have here a submission to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee by Associate Professor Rob Fowler, Director of the Australian Centre for Environmental Law at the University of Adelaide. In the submission, he goes in great detail to the heart of the legal issues inherent in this change. I quote only a small section of the submission. Under `Commonwealth Constitutional Powers', Professor Fowler says:</para><para>Relations between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories . . . have at times been acrimonious, particularly where projects being undertaken by or with the support of State governments have been made subject to Commonwealth environmental assessment and approval processes. A dominant theme in this context has been the extent to which the Commonwealth has the constitutional capacity to regulate the environment. Until relatively recently, the prevailing political view within both State and Commonwealth governments was that primary power resided with the States under the Constitution and that the Commonwealth had only a limited capacity . . . This view was expressed first in the late 1960's, when the Senate appointed two Select Committees to enquire into air and water pollution problems in Australia.</para><para>Much has changed since these reports were provided to the Senate. 
</para><para>There have been the historic High Court decisions that I mentioned earlier concerning Fraser Island, the Franklin Dam and the Queensland Wet Tropics. Those decisions indicated that the Commonwealth can, and I would argue should, utilise a suite of constitutional powers, if it desires, to provide a broad legislative coverage of environmental responsibilities. These include the powers with respect to external affairs, trade and commerce, corporations, territories and Commonwealth places.</para><para>The previous narrow view of Commonwealth powers is no longer tenable. But as with so many issues that we face with this government, they want to go back in time. They are not forward looking. They want to go back to the 1960s and the 1950s. That has always been the hallmark of the Howard influence. He is not comfortable with the 1990s and looking forward. He wants to go back. I believe this is very evident in this particular piece of legislation.</para><para>This previous narrow view is no longer tenable and should not be being seriously advanced in 1999. Thus it can be said at the outset that there is no substantial constitutional barrier to defining in a broad way the role and responsibilities of the Commonwealth. This is not to say there are no limitations, but simply that there is considerable scope to work within the limitations which do exist. There has emerged in practice, however, a substantial difference between the legal Constitution and the realpolitik Constitution. Despite the High Court decisions which support a wider Commonwealth role in environmental matters, the legacy of the earlier narrow view has been that the states have proceeded to develop extensive legislative and administrative arrangements for environmental management.</para><para>Obviously, I am not opposed to working with state governments, but I think that our experience of some of the quite horrendous decisions of some state governments in the last 20 years should act as a warning to us that we need that protection power and we need it in a much broader way than has been presented in the bill.</para><para>The second major concern I would like to cover is the extent to which this bill recognises indigenous concerns, because I believe very little account has been taken of them. I start with indigenous involvement in the development of this bill. Despite the specific centrality of the environment to indigenous people's rights and interests in environmental protection and biodiversityâacknowledged by state, territory, national and international political bodiesâthe bill has failed to recognise this centrality in the general structure, in the specific provisions or in the process through which the bills were developed. There was negligible involvement of indigenous peoples in the policy and legal development of the two bills.</para><para>ATSIC, with portfolio responsibility to advise the government on all indigenous issues, was just not consulted. ATSIC only saw a preliminary bill just prior to its tabling in the House of Representatives. In their Senate submission, ATSIC further noted that wide ranging consultations with indigenous stakeholders had not occurred. This has been reiterated by a range of land councils and the Kakadu board of management.</para><para>This consultation failure not only contravenes the above national and international obligations but is contrary to the coalition's public commitment to inclusive government. For example, the coalition's policy statement for indigenous peoples during the 1996 election provided that the coalition is committed to `developing a political system whereby indigenous peoples participate fully, with their unique contribution recognised and valued by the rest of the community.' That is very easy to say in the lead-up to an election but clearly it is not a priority as far as Minister Hill is concerned. I can accept that Senator Hill has decided that he has not got time or that it is expedient not to have extensive consultations with indigenous peopleâthat is also the hallmark of this governmentâbut what I cannot understand, Senator Bartlett, is how the Democrats can be prepared to turn their back on indigenous peoples and rush this bill through. Surely, if for no other reason, this bill could be delayed for consultation between now and August when the Senate reconvenes.</para><para>I continue on the issue of international obligations. I would have thought that this government and particularly the DemocratsâI do not know if they are part of this government these days; it seems as though they must beâwould remember that the committee in Geneva that monitors the elimination of racial discrimination has been extremely critical of this government's policies in relation to consultation and working to protect indigenous people's rights. That is subject to some response by the government at the moment and is likely to go back to Geneva in August and possibly go on to the General Assembly for report in December. This will be yet another example of how the Australian government is absolutely dismissive of its responsibilities under conventions signed.</para><para>I would like to just detail some of those international obligations. The 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity, ratified by Australia, recognises indigenous peoples in sustaining biological resources. For example, the preamble recognises the:</para><para>close and traditional dependence of many indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles on biological resources, and the desirability of sharing equitably benefits arising from the use of traditional knowledge, innovations and practices relevant to the conservation of biological diversity.</para><para>Articles in the convention reiterate this aspiration. For example article 8(j) provides that each contracting party shall, as far as possible and appropriate:</para><para>Subject its national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvementâ</para><para>Senator Bartlettâ</para><para>of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits . . .</para><para>In relation to sustainable use of components of biological diversity, each contracting party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate:</para><para>Protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices . . . 
</para><para>The recognition by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories of international obligations is at the moment questionable. The National Strategy of the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity was prepared and agreed to by the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and all state and territory Premiers in 1994-95. The strategy aimed to bridge the gap between current activities and the effective identification, conservation and management of biological diversity. I am not sure that this strategy has even been considered in the debate and particularly in the deal that has been done with the Democrats. We will not have time to question whether the strategy is being incorporated and there  certainly will not be time for indigenous people to be involved in the process.</para><para>In conclusion, I urge the Democrats to sleep well tonight, but to think carefully before sleeping well and to wake fresh and determined to come back into this chamber and require the government to (a) take more time in the actual process of debating this bill and (b) refer it back for further consultation with indigenous peoples. I think that is absolutely essential. There are many Australians who have battled for over 30 years to ensure that Australia has a system whereby there is an overriding power of the Commonwealth to protect the environment so that we are not at the mercy of irresponsible state governments. The Democrats should be prepared to seriously rethink these issues and perhaps spend the time between the middle of next week and August consulting widely in the Australian community, consulting their own members who, I know, will be very distressed and disturbed about the Democrats' decision over the last 24 hours. They were unhappy enough about the GST deal, particularly in relation to the diesel fuel rebate, and this will just exacerbate their concerns. In good spirit, I urge the Democrats to rethink this evening.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5963</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSpeakers from the Green parties and the ALP have outlined many of the flaws in the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline> , and the Democrats, of course, are in agreement with the flaws that they have highlighted. We high 
 lighted a couple months ago in our report how deeply flawed this bill in its original form is, and that is why we have needed to move so many amendments. It is probably appropriate that we move on as soon as we can to discussing those amendments so that we can actually start looking at how that has been addressed and how this bill, as amended, will actually lead to a positive outcome for the environment. I certainly will welcome the opportunity to start examining the improved amendments to this legislation rather than rehashing all the problems with the legislation as it stands at the moment, problems which have already been the subject of quite detailed Senate committee reports.</para></talk.start><para>Some of the previous speakers put forward the quite legitimate question, `Why the rush on this issue?' I think that is a fair enough question and I am quite happy to acknowledge that up front. The Democrats believe quite genuinely that what we have achieved with the very significant number of amendments to the significantly flawed original bill will lead to a significantly better outcome for the environment now than currently applies under existing law. As a party that has a strong commitment to protecting the environment, we see this as an opportunity to get better environmental protection.</para><para>Previous speakers have also highlighted some of the many problems that are currently before us in terms of decimation of our environment. We agree and acknowledgeâand, indeed, we have played a strong role in highlightingâmany of the detrimental actions to the environment that are taking place in our country. And that highlights, all the more importantly, why we need to get improved legislation in place as quickly as possible so that, wherever possible, those negative actions can be prevented.</para><para>It is also the case, as previous speakers have pointed outâand as the Democrats have often pointed out in this place and outside, and will continue to do soâthat the current government, as with the previous government, has not got the best record on the environment. For that reason, we think it is important that there should not be any risk, however small, that the government may change its 
 mind and not join with the Democrats in making these significant advances in environmental protection within this country.</para><para>If during my time serving in this chamberâhowever long that may beâI can be remembered for the amendments that are made to this bill and nothing else, I will certainly happily accept that. The Democrats are about getting improvements for the environment in legislation. We are about improved protection for the environment. I want to play a role in achieving that because that is certainly what I am here for.</para><para>It is important to emphasise the role played by parliament in dealing with legislation. This is not its only role but it seeks to achieve a net improvement in existing legislation, and that is what the Democrats have done. There are clearly areasâwe are quite up front about this and we are promoting changesâin which there needs to be further action, and we will be highlighting this as strongly as anybody else. We will be working as hard as anybody else to ensure that further action is taken in those areas.</para><para>But the Democrats as a party are not going to sacrifice advances in environmental protection because we cannot protect everything now. We cannot protect everything now and we are not going to go forward with nothing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âThe chainsaws are happening now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âThe chainsaws are happening now, under the existing legislation; and if we knock this bill back the chainsaws will keep happening, and we will also lose the opportunity for advancing environmental protection in other areas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is probably worth saying, and I think it is widely acknowledged, that Senator Brown, prior to coming to this place, had a record out in the community of working to advance the cause of the environment. I certainly acknowledge that. As this is an environmental issue, I feel passionate about it. I acknowledge that he is passionate about it and I wish more people in the country were passionate about it. I would ask him in good faith and good spirit to consider the actual outcome and the purpose of being in the parliament. What is 
 important in relation to this is to ensure that people work together to deliver positive outcomes for the environment.</para><para>I know from my experience in working with very many people who put in very many hours in the environment movement that that is what they are there for. They are there to ensure that we get positive net gains for the environment, and that is what the Democrats are here in the parliament for. Sometimes you can lose sight of what you are actually in politics for, which is to get positive benefits, and you can be in a situation where perhaps you are tempted to play politics. I would ask Senator Brown, who has now been a politician for a very long time, to perhaps remember what he is actually in politics for, which is to get a better outcome for the environment, and not to simply play politics on an issue.</para><para>In his speech, Senator Brown criticised a number of people that I am sure he knows well in the environment movement, including some very esteemed environmentalists in Tasmania who have worked strongly to promote his aims on the environment over many years. I would have been surprised if he had wanted to indicate previously that those people are fools, that they do not understand environmental legislation or advance environmental issues. I urge him to look quite genuinely at the motivations of those people who have never been on the Democrats' side, as opposed to a Green party side, and remember why they are in this business as wellâand that is to get positive environmental outcomes.</para><para>Let me emphasise and outline some of the positive outcomes that we have achieved. We have achieved significant improvements on existing environmental legislation that will enable better opportunities for protecting the environment than what we have as the law currently stands. We have a significant number of amendments which will require the minister to have regard to relevant bioregional plans in making a decision under the act, which is clearly an advance on what we have now. We have amendments to require public consultation on a draft of each plan to ensure that bioregional plans reflect the knowledge 
 and interests of local communities within a bioregionâa significant advance on what we have now.</para><para>We have amendments which will improve on the current listing procedures for threatened species. The flaws that exist in the current law would stay in place if we did not pass this bill. Those who are trying to knock back this bill in its improved form are saying to environmentalists, `We want the current flawed system to stay in place. We do not want these improvements on listing procedures for threatened species.' Categories of threatened species will be expanded in line with internationally recognised categories. These categories include conservation dependent species which have not yet become vulnerable or endangered but could be if relevant conservation programs ceased. This is taking a long-term view of a crucial aspect of better environmental planning. For the first time, vulnerable ecological communities will be listed, as well as critically endangered and endangered communitiesânot just individual species but the ecological communities surrounding them.</para><para>The minister will be able to list key threatening processes on the basis of scientific criteria. On current law, a process cannot be listed if it is not feasible, efficient or effective to develop a threat abatement plan for the process. For the first time, with these amendments, there will be a full timetable for the listing process from the point at which a nomination is received, forwarded to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee for advice, and a decision made on listing.</para><para>The bill establishes an Australian whale sanctuary. This measure maintains what we acknowledge is an area where the government has performed creditably in the past in the leadership in the conservation of whales. We hope that state governments will join in with the mechanism that is now being created by this legislation to add coastal waters under state jurisdiction to the sanctuary. Of course, if they do not, that will not be any reversal of what the current situation is but it again provides the scope for further improvement of the existing situation. There would be a ban on the capture of dolphins for live display, 
 which is something that I am strongly supportive of. It gives it legislative prescription; it actually puts it in force.</para><para>Strict new liability offencesâstricter than what exists under current legislationâwill be introduced. This will provide a higher level of protection for those species than currently exists. We will require Commonwealth agencies to ensure that a covenant is put in place when selling or leasing Commonwealth land, to ensure that critical habitat on the register is appropriately protected. This is something that we do not have now; it is something we would lose if we did not allow this legislation to go through. Proposed amendments will reinstate provisions in existing legislation that ensure a high level of public accountability in the issuing of permits.</para><para>We also recognise the special contribution that indigenous people can make to the conservation of biodiversity. The proposed amendments will ensure that roles and interests of indigenous people will be taken into account in developing recovery plans, threat abatement plans and wildlife conservation plans for protected speciesâa greater involvement and greater input than what they currently have. There will be greater opportunities for control of non-native species, invasive species, including weeds as well as animals. That will provide opportunities for greater regulatory control than exists under the legislation as it now stands. It will give legislative effect to the government's election commitment of 1998 to establish an alert list of invasive species.</para><para>There are also issues such as access to biological resources and ensuring that the extensive knowledge of indigenous people over tens of thousands of years about biological resources is employed in research and in the search for natural substances which have potential value in a range of fields, not just environmental value but economic value. The Convention on Biological Diversity recognised the right of parties to control access to their genetic resources and to obtain a fair and equitable share of the benefits arising from those resources. Currently, there is no legislation to enable the Commonwealth to control access to biological resources in Common 
 wealth areas. The bill, as amended, will address this and is a significant advance which we would lose if we walked away from this legislation.</para><para>The amendments proposed by the Democrats remove a provision in the original bill which gave rise to substantial concern for environmentalists, which is the capacity for conservation agreements to specify activities which would be exempted from normal environmental assessment and approval processes. We have put that back in so that there is no capacity for those activities to be exempted. These requirements provide a tangible mechanism for implementing Australia's international obligations and national objectives relating to indigenous people and biodiversity.</para><para>For the first time, Commonwealth legislation will explicitly provide for the protection and management of wetlands designated under the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importanceâlegislative protection that was not there previously and which we would lose if we walked away from this legislation. Similar provisions apply to world heritage properties. While such properties are currently protected by the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, that act does not adequately reflect Australia's international obligations. The current legislation, which we would be stuck with if we walked away from the improvements that the Democrats have achieved, puts a series of obstacles in the way of the protection of world heritage properties.</para><para>In contrast, with the amendments and the new features that the Democrats have managed to gain, protective mechanisms available under the bill will apply to all properties. All actions which have a significant impact on the world heritage values of a property will be addressed by legislationâevery single action. All the hurdles which are in place under the existing legislationâthe hurdles which those who want to oppose the bill want to remain in placeâwill be removed.</para><para>The bill provides some significant innovations in the protection and management of Commonwealth reserves. The additional amendments that the Democrats have negotiated to the bill will provide other areas for 
 improved environmental outcomes, and those will be detailed further in the committee stage of the debate when the Democrat amendments are put forward. The list of significant extra advances include provisions enabling conservation zones to be proclaimed to protect biodiversity while an area is being assessed for inclusion.</para><para>Existing provisions relating to indigenous people's rights to use Commonwealth land for water and hunting have been reinstated. Bilateral agreements will not apply to Kakadu, Uluru and Booderee national parks, which is consistent with the wishes of the traditional owners, as expressed during the Senate inquiry into the bill. All of the Democrat amendments have been achieved in consultation with those environmental and indigenous organisations that have wanted to grasp the opportunity to make forward moves towards protecting our environmentâmoves which are a great advance over what is in the existing legislation. That is why so many of those groups have supported what the Democrats have achieved in this area.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5966</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  was always going to be a controversial bill.

If ever there were a group of people in this country who for their own self-respect needed to remain silent, given their record, it would be the Tasmanian Liberals.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats have for many years sought to demonstrate to this country that they are a new political force. They have claimed to 
 have a greater sense of moral values. They assert time and again that they are a political organisation that rises above the hurly-burly of mainstream politics. They claim that they are out there championing the environment, social justice and a range of other very noble causes in a manner which sets them apart from other political parties in this country. What we have discovered here today is that the Democrats have joined with the Liberals and become, like the Liberals, a party that is quite prepared, as Senator Brown indicated earlier this evening, to sit at the table of power and forget the politics of principle.</para><para>What we have established tonight is that the Democrats, in their latest capitulation to the demands of the Liberal Party, have surrendered any claim they might have to moral superiority on the question of the environment. What we have established tonight is that the Democrats have become like any other political organisation in this country. They are concerned with the immediate and the practical. They have dispensed with any claim to have an attitude superior to any other political organisation in this country. We have the so-called new party, the Democrats, behaving just like the old party, the Liberal Party.</para><para>We have been told that their position on the deal they have struck with the government on this highly controversial legislation is supported by a range of conservation groups. We saw on the news tonight the example of a range of organisations supporting the Democrats. They did not tell us that Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society remain strongly opposed to the measures that the Democrats have now engaged in with this government.</para><para>I am always surprised when Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation and others make these sorts of statements because I always look at their record in seeking support for the Liberals. We saw just before the 1996 election a gathering of noted conservationists down at Sherbrooke Forest in Melbourne. They were on TV urging people to support the re-election of the Liberal government. We saw Alec Marr and Mr Downie, who turned out to be a Democrat 
 candidate in a subsequent election, urging that Australia needed a Liberal government because, in their opinion at that time, it is only through a Liberal government that you see strong environmental performance.</para><para>What have we seen since the Liberals have come into office? We have seen the Natural Heritage Trust established out of the privatisation of Telstra. That involved the destruction of one of our greatest public enterprises. The returns supported a pork-barrelling arrangement to try to buy off green support around this country. We saw how the National Heritage Trust became a rort. This government sought to display its favours around the country in a highly partisan manner.</para><para>We saw the actions of the government on greenhouse gas emissions. We saw how this Liberal government sought to take upon itself the mantle of strengthening and developing the Jabiluka uranium mine in Kakadu National Park. We saw the devastation of their policies with regard to Hinchinbrook development. Before this chamber now is the proposal to hand back a range of environmental protection powers to the states. We are now seeing the expansion of woodchip exports before the completion of regional forest agreements. All these measures that have been put in place give an indication of the sort of government that the Liberals provide and which the Democrats are now seeking to support. The Democrats are seeking to buttress it via their support of the new measures contained in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill.</para><para>The Democrats were once able to present themselves as a party of idealists romantically seeking out the truth and seeking to establish a higher plane of political activity. We now have a grubby deal which greatly disappoints the many people who are in erstwhile support of the Democrats. We can expect considerable levels of disruption within the Democrats in the months to come. I predict that quite substantive levels of disquiet will be expressed within the Democrats, particularly in my state of Victoria. I look forward to the public discussion that will inevitably develop about the role of Senator Allison in the negotiation 
 of these arrangements. I look forward to the discussion about preselection in the state of Victoria when Senator Allison comes forward. I am sure that a high level of interest will be shown by rank and file Democrat supporters, who over the years have come to believe the rhetoric that the Democrats are a special sort of political force and a much more idealistic and noble enterprise than could ever be seen in any other part of the country.</para><para>I am also looking forward to discussions within the New South Wales branch of the Democrats. I am sure that Senator Bourne will enjoy the public attention that will no doubt follow this arrangement as those within the Democrats in New South Wales seek to express their views about the implications of the Democrats' betrayal of principles and the implications of the Democrats turning their back on their established commitments to the environment and social justice questions.</para><para>This follows on from their craven capitulation to the government on the GST, so I have no doubt that the green coalition of idealists that have made up the Democrats over the years will now start to crumble. That is a great disappointment to me because I think in politics we do need a range of opinions being expressed. I find that a very difficult prospect to have to faceâthat the Democrats are going to enter into a period of great turmoil as they and ordinary members of the Democrats begin to understand the implications of the arrangements that their leaders have entered into.</para><para>There are some in the Labor Party who have said to me over the years that the real difference between those on the left and those on the right is that those on the left really do have a deep understanding and know that they will be betrayed by their representatives. I can see why they would think that, and we do have a clear example. The Democrats, who have seen themselves very much on the left of Australian politics, will now have to reassess their role in the political debate in this country because quite clearly they are positioning themselves as a party on the far right of the political divide in this country. I am sure the Liberals will be able to look forward to enjoying the benefits of having such a stable and reliable ally as the Demo 
 crats, because I have no doubt that these pressures will come to bear in all sorts of ways. I have no doubt that, when it comes to the discussion of preference arrangements right across this country, there will be enormous pressure for various political organisations to reassess their attitude towards the Democrats.</para><para>I can assure you that, in the state of Victoria, I for one will find it necessary to draw to the attention of the people that I mix with the difference between the various parties, their attitudes and the way in which they have performed in the parliament. I think it is important that we do assess the rhetoric and the actions that political parties engage in so maybe these so-called new politicians, the Democrats, can be judged on their record. We can see quite clearly from the example we have before us tonight that the Democrats have once again been found wanting. I have no doubt there would be hundreds of thousands of Australians who, in their sincerity, believed that the Democrats were a different type of political organisation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Margetts interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âSenator Margetts indicates to me that she is surprised by my expression of opinion on this question. I am sure they do believe in their sincerity that the Democrats were trying to achieve certain things. After all, was it not the political party that said they were going to keep the rest of us honest? But we find in this arrangement that no-one is keeping the Democrats honest. I trust that the rank and file of the Democrats will be able to give full and proper consideration to these questions because I suspect that there will not be an opportunity in this chamber to do that. I suspect that, as part of the grand new alliance between those of the ultra-left of the Democrats and the ultra-rightâthe tory rightâof the Liberal government, there will be an arrangement in place to curtail the level of public examination of these arrangements. I hope I am wrong, but I have a terrible sinking feeling that, deep down, the Democrats do not want a proper discussion of the implications of these arrangementsâthey do not want there to be public scrutiny of the deal that they have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The backroom arrangements bring with them great contradictions. The real problem for the Democrats, if I might offer some gratuitous advice on this question, is that you do have to have a bit of experience in dealing with people in power. If you are in a minority and you are seeking to demonstrate a commitment to ideals, you ought to be able to have a resolution, you must be resilient, you must be determined and you must have the capacity to understand the strength of your own position. The Democrats have failed on all these fronts. What has happened, quite frankly, is they have been stood over. They have capitulated. They have allowed themselves to be duchessed. They have allowed themselves to fall into the old trap of being told how important they are and how worthy their contribution is. As a consequence, they have found it necessary to accept compromises and to be flexible in such a way that we have seen them walk away from long held principles.</para><para>We see in this package before us a situation like we saw with the GSTâwhere for many, many months we were told by the Democrats that they never, ever move on the question of books and the GST. We were told for many, many months there would be a commitment to defend education as a central and important ingredient to which all Australians should have access. The Democrats, with their commitment to those high ideals, found it was necessary to capitulate. Sad as it was, in the interest of good government they had to capitulate. They had to turn their back on their supporters, they had to turn their back on the election commitments they had made, and they had to turn their back on their long held philosophical views about the role of the politician within this chamber. Now we see a miserable and totally inadequate proposition: it was explained to us tonight that the Democrats have delivered. They have delivered all right. They have delivered lock, stock and barrel to the government. They have wound up all their supporters into a nice tight little bundle and delivered them to the tory government. So much for their commitment to the environment; so much for their concern to ensure that there was appropriate and adequate representation for the environmental questions within this chamber.</para><para>We were told of improvements and expansion of the Commonwealth powers. That is what they are claiming. They no doubt have the government spin doctors working for them these days, because that is the sort of statement that is worthy of Dr Kemp. What you do is hand the powers back to the states, you reduce the level of Commonwealth environmental powers, you make sure the Commonwealth withdraws from its responsibilities, but you announce to the public that you are expanding the Commonwealth's role in terms of environmental protection. All you have to do, in the best traditions of <inline font-style="italic">1984</inline>  and Huxley's <inline font-style="italic">Brave New World</inline>, is to say exactly the opposite to what you are doing; and that is what they are doing here.</para><para>We have been told for instance is that this is a proposition that has regard to the EPIP Act, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals Act, but it is a proposition that will provide greater certaintyâwe will see propositions advanced in such a way that Commonwealth action will be proposed with greater certainty. What they do not tell you is that the opportunities for the Commonwealth to get involved will be reducedâthey will actually diminish. In a whole range of other issues, the same proposition comes forward.</para><para>What I am particularly concerned about is the way in which the Democrats have capitulated and abandoned their long held commitments. They have put themselves in a situation, with regard to bilateral agreements, where the most reactionary elements within the state bureaucracies and the state arenas will be able to exercise much greater influence. Those who hold real economic power in this country will have  a greater capacity to influence development projects, which are much greater in number at the state level, and they will enjoy greater confidence and greater certainty. And of course they will have the capacity to exercise their will over the will of the majority of Australians.</para><para>For instance, when it comes to actions in regard to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parkâyou probably have a greater understanding of these issues, Mr Acting Deputy President HoggâI am told that, up and down the Queensland coast, there are something like 
 150 major developments ready to roll. Of course, if you withdraw the Commonwealth from any overriding scrutiny of such propositions, there is always going to be confusion about responsibilities of the state government and the Commonwealth government, and it leaves a large gap through which unscrupulous developers can jump. That is essentially a continuation of the policies we have seen in relation to the Hinchinbrook developmentâpolicies which have seen this government abrogate its responsibilities and act in a thoroughly negligent way.</para><para>In my judgment, we ought to have been able to expect a much higher level of commitment and genuine leadership from the Commonwealth government. I see that Senator Hill has just entered the chamber; I am sure he has come in to listen carefully to the comments senators are making about this miserable proposal before the chamber. We ought to have been able to see as a result of this extensive reviewâpropositions which, I fully acknowledge, were begun under a Labor governmentâinitiatives which provide a genuine opportunity to strengthen the role of government, ensure proper protection in environmental questions and ensure the proper protection of Australians' future through an effective use of government power. Under this government, such an opportunity is lostâit is squanderedâand it is now fully supported by the Democrats.</para><para>The Democrats say they can come in here with a few minor amendments, which will make them feel a lot betterâand it gives them a fig leaf to be able to suggest that they have had a big impact on policy. They can be told how important they are, how responsible they are, and how they are now at the table and they are important players in the Australian political debate. They have left the fringes of politics but, of course, they have also left their principles and they have left their commitment to the sorts of ideals that they have held for a very long time. They have now sat with a tory government and have been able to exercise what they perceive to be a capacity to set the directions of government. The truth is that they will not set any directions for government, other than those that have al 
 ready been set by the government itself. They have capitulated to the government.</para><para>What we will see will be a reduction in Commonwealth control over environmental regulationâthe extent of which is yet to be determined, but there will be a substantial reduction. We will see the absence of a Commonwealth regulatory framework over matters and, despite the various COAG agreements which have sought to establish important principles with regard to, for instance, climate control and greenhouse gases, we will see a further devolution of Commonwealth control over projects and other Commonwealth decision making processes with regard to bilateral agreements. We will see an agreed process of capitulation; a surrender to the interests of development and to the interests of powerful companies which have the capacity to directly control this government. We will see the absence of effective public participation in key development questions and an extension of broad discretionary powers of the minister in relation to a whole range of issues being presented in this bill.</para><para>What the government gets out of this is a continuation of its ideological agenda and a winding back of its commitment to participate in civil society and the development of this country in such a way as to ensure proper protections for all the different people who enjoy the fruits of living in this country. We will see this government being legitimised in its drive to abrogate its responsibilities and turn its back on what ought to be a commitment to providing effective legislative and political leadership. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>5970</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn October of this year we are going to celebrateâor at least I imagine some people will celebrateâthe 60th anniversary of another deal in the 20th century which was supposed to be the deal to end all deals.

He sold off half of Czecho 
 slovakia and made it pretty clear to the Germans that, if they wanted the rest of it, all they had to do was wait a little while and they would be able to pick it up. Sixty years ago, that deal was consummated in Munich. Nev flew home and the aircraft stopped at, I presume, Heathrow or whatever it was, and he got out and waved a piece of paper. The piece of paper was entitled `Peace in Our Time'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have always had a bit of sympathy for Nev. After all, he went over there, and about the only aircraft that Britain could scrounge up at the time was the one that carried him to Munich. They did not have much else going for them and they did not have any kind of strength in the deal, and I guess any time the Germans wanted to take Czechoslovakia they could do so. It just so happened that Neville helped them along a bit. In fact, a few months later he loaned them enough money to build an anti-aircraft defence system around Berlin.</para><para>The absolute puzzle about the Democrats in the last couple of weeks is why they are doing what they are doing. I cannot understand what the strategy is. They were all looking forward to the balance of power. We had Senator Woodley a few weeks ago paying out Senator Bob Brown and telling him he was irrelevant and that pretty soon, starting on 1 July, the Democrats would be calling the shots. I have to tell you that they are doing it before 1 July. In fact, they are doing it so comprehensively, I do not know what tomorrow's deal is going to be. I do not know what they are going to wheel in here next and say, `We've gone around to the Howard government and, boy, have we got a deal for you. We've jumped into bed with the Howard government and we are taking the Prime Minister at his word that he will still respect us in the morning.' The consummation of the deal has taken placeâevery day there is a new dealâand we are told that they will be respected in the morning.</para><para>Today's deal, I think, is one of the more interesting ones. At least with the Telstra debate there were a couple of weeks of argument around the place before the guillotine was moved on the whole thing. But this one has just come right out from stage left. We should have really picked it up, I sup 
 pose, earlier today. Once we saw the Democrats voting with the government, as I understand it, on the production of documents, we should have known that this crowd unfortunately have sullied themselves, that they are no longer the virgins in white clothing that they make themselves out to be, that they are the political whores that we find in all sorts of images the public hasâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âI would like to indicate that I object to that use of terminology and the sexual innuendo, and I think they should be withdrawn.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name></talker><para>âIf I can help you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think I called them political whores.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>âI think you should withdraw that, Senator Quirke.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name></talker><para>âI do not think I can in this instance.

I find the deal they have done a staggering one. It is the deal that all fishermen in this country would love: you go out with a fishing rod and you forget the bait, but you do not need it; you just chuck the hook out and the biggest fish jump on it. That is what the Democrats have done. They have jumped on an unbaited hook. I am puzzled as to why they would want to do this.

In Neville Chamberlain's case, he did not have much else going for him. But there is no doubt that the Prime Minister will do anything to get his GST up. There is no doubt that this Prime Minister was politically lost a few weeks ago when Senator Harradine said that he could not agree. You should have seen the faces on those senators oppositeâthey said it all. They knew that the whole agenda was ripped up and burnt in front of them. But, no, not a thing of it: the Democrats came around very quickly.</para><para>We are yet to see the argument about what point the chicken becomes 10 per cent dearer and we are yet to see how this diesel fuel stuff has been worked out or what other odd idea these people have. I suspect that is what we are going to get. We are going to get a GST bill full of very, very odd ideas from a group of basically very odd people who have gone around and done a deal with Mr Howard and his mob. That deal, no doubt, will be brought in here and I imagine it will be guillotined as well. In fact, I think the party of free speechâno doubt before much longerâwill not like listening to too much more of this stuff, and they will gag this one as well. They are going to say they are going to roll those 400 amendments through just like the other night on Telstra. The only difference was that in Telstra I think at the end of the day there were about 20 amendments; this time there are about 400.</para><para>I think it is rather instructive to have a look at a couple of passages of what the Democrats have had to say on this legislation. I want to draw the Senate's attention to Senator Allison's remarks in the second reading 
 debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill. She said:</para><para>I want to talk a bit about the consultation.</para><para>We do, too. To continue:</para><para>There was very limited time for consultation, initially with regard to the discussion paper and then limited time for the committee to reportâ</para><para>that is, the legislative standing committee here in the Senate. She went on:</para><para>The COAG agreement, which was the source of this legislation, did not involve the public and was quite secretive . . .</para><para>That is the word I want to home in onâ`secretive'. Not only did the COAG process keep it secret from the public, but this process here today has done exactly the same. I suspect that, by the time we finish tomorrow, that secretive process will see a bill go into law. It may be a good bill; it may be bad bill, but I can tell you that it is not going to be a properly scrutinised bill. It is going to be rammed through here by a bunch of people who hawk themselves around at each election saying, `We are different; we are going to keep them honest.' I will not use that other word that has been used here today, because I would probably be asked to withdraw it anyway.</para><para>At the end of the day, I suspect that there is such a difference here between the way the Democrats talk out there, what they promise at election time, and what they are delivering here todayâand what, no doubt, they will deliver here tomorrow and what, no doubt, they will deliver here next weekâthat in fact this is an enormous break in faith with the electorate. Senator Allison was dead right when she said these processes are secretive. That was on 27 April. I would not have thought that in the short time to 22 June Senator Allison and the rest of her friends would actually have joined in the very process she was complaining about.</para><para>The other document that has been going around here today reminds me of something like a death warrant. If you look at the death warrant for King Charles IâI think I got mine off a cornflakes box about 30 years agoâyou see that it had all the signatures on it as well. I just wonder what sort of political show you are running when you have got to 
 get everyone to sign on the dotted line at the end of a statement. I know they have got a few stresses and strains in there and not everyone is happy with the way things are being run. Quite frankly, when you have got four aces in your hand, why you would want to do a deal between now and next week leaves me puzzled. Is it the case that the Democrats are really not up to or not prepared for having the balance of power, or is there some other explanation? When I look at the document, I find some rather naive statements. One refers to other senators. This document says:</para><para>At the time the Democrats pointed out this strategy would only be successful if Senators Colston and Harradine gave a commitment to oppose the bill at the "second reading".</para><para>What they are saying there is that the Democrats were concerned about the role of Senator Colston and Senator Harradine and the fact that they may have voted this bill into legislation over the top of the Democrats.</para><para>If you have got the Prime Minister by whatever image you want to use, by the hand or by some other part of his body, and indeed you are holding his entire political future in your hand, or in both hands, I would have thought that you could have done a deal on just about anything. I would have thought you could have gone around to the Prime Minister's suiteâI have never been there and I think I am unlikely to be invited there, at least for the next couple of yearsâand knocked on the door and got past the surly guard. I am sure he would have let Senator Lees and company in and they would have made them a cup of tea or coffee or whatever they drink around there. I reckon Senator Lees could have said, `Prime Minister, we have a problem. On that argument that unfortunately we are having about that chicken and how is taxed, it is going to take us till about September to work out which bits of the chicken are going to be 10 per cent GSTable. On the other hand, we have got a lot of time on this environment bill. If we could have that pulled off the agenda until, say, September then we could deal with the GST this week and next week.' The Prime Minister, being such a reasonable fellow and basically being in the tumbrel on the way to his own 
 guillotining, I suspect would have accepted that deal.</para><para>In fact, I think Senator Lees could have been even more brazen than that. I think Senator Lees could have said, `Look, it is like this. We need to keep faith with those people we have been appealing to for the last 10 or 15 years, the environmental groups. After all, we have got some Green senators who are competing with us for this particular constituency,' and doing a fine job too, I might add. I think Senator Lees could have said to the Prime Minister, `We just want to sort out the GST at this stage. Please don't stick anything else on the agenda.' But, no, we did not get that. We got a very happy Senator Allison and a very happy Senator Bartlett coming in here today and saying, `Boy, have we got a deal for you.' They have even got their photographs on the top of this particular document.</para><para>The document says that the conservation movement is very happy with these arrangements that they have made. I do not know where they got that information. That would be a first. Some of these groups would not be happy with any kind of deal or arrangement or any of the rest of it. I suspect that the miners will be happy with this arrangement, and the reason is that they are now probably going to have a full swag of what they want. Probably a lot of groups in Australia would be very happy, because they know that ganging up on state governments is a much easier task than ganging up on the national government. That is really what this is all about at the end of the day.</para><para>This particular document that has come out urges me to read all of the great concessions that these people have made and points out that they have all done a very good job: they have tightened up all the loopholes and this bill is now repaired. Some of my colleagues have said it is not. I would like to say that I might agree with them. It may well be that they have done a reasonable job. I doubt it very much, but I would like probably more than the next 16 hours or thereabouts to have a look at it. I would like to listen to some of the debate on this. After all, what are we talking about? Are we talking about some 
 thing insignificant or are we talking about something that is very significant?

But I would like those senators, like everyone else, to have the opportunity to get into this debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we are seeing develop here is a new political relationship, and that political relationship is just like the old one in the Fraser government. At the end of the day, that is where the Democrats came from. No, they were not a bunch of people in caftans then, sitting around in a circle singing <inline font-style="italic">Kumbaya</inline>. They were in there with the Fraser government because most of them could not get preselection within the Liberal Party. I can give you a few names if people want me to. Right up until 1983 and 1984 these guys were on the right. Did they have a good industry policy? I remember the former Senator Siddons in here with his industry policy. He was advocating the sorts of reforms Mr Reith advocates years before Mr Reith even thought about them.</para><para>Then in 1984 you had Mr Garrett and Midnight Oil and suddenly the Democrats became left of centre. They had a very sudden change in their politics; they changed overnight. They became the left wing conscience of the Labor government for the next 13 years. They hawked themselves out there as the great greenies. They hawked themselves out there as the ones that were going to make sure proper process was developedâtransparency, no secrecy. They got the balance of power back and a couple of weeks before they actually get it they have jumped into bed with the government. They are practising for what is going to come.</para><para>What we saw here this afternoon when they voted against documents being produced to this chamber should tell everybody to what 
 lengths some of these people will go to achieve their own ends. They used to tell everyone that they were differentâthat they were not like other politicians. Well, they are not. There are a lot of politicians around here who believe in open government, who believe that process should be fully adopted, who believe that deals like this ought to be much more accountable and out there in the public domain and who believe that these sorts of things should not happen.</para><para>I hope I am wrong, but I suspect that, at some stage when somebody finally works out which bit of the chicken is going to be taxed and which bit is not, we are going to have a gag motion on this bill and on all the amendments that are floating around on it and, I suspect, on any other bill that suits the Prime Minister before we get up on 30 June.</para><para>I cannot understand why the Democrats are in such a hurry on this particular issue. After next Wednesday they are the only group the government or, for that matter, the opposition can deal with to achieve certain legislative ends. Possibly, they wanted to jump in there quickly in case a couple of others, namely Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, beat them to it. But it tells us how fragile this GST deal is and that it may not even last the next few weeks. It tells us what problems there are in their own show. We will look with interest to see what deals emerge in the next 24 to 48 hours.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5974</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore I begin my formal contribution, I would like to concur with some of the comments made by Senator Quirke. One thing that is levelled continually against us on this side of the chamber by the government is the experience that many of us have, including you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, in the trade union movement and in negotiations with employers and industry groups and so on. In many conversations in Tasmania over the last couple of weeks I have had cause to reflect that I do not think the Democrats would have lasted five minutes in the union movement in terms of negotiation. I have had people say to me on the GST bill, `Why didn't they hold out for more? Why did they cave in so early?' The answer is that I do not 
 know. Normally in politics you do know, you can articulate what the reason is, but I genuinely do not know why they folded so early. In terms of negotiating, I do not think they would make it past shop steward 1 at the old Clyde Cameron college.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett made some interesting comments prior to the dinner break. I accept that he was genuinely concerned that the government might change its mind on this bill if it were deferred for consideration until later in the year. As Senator Quirke quite correctly pointed out, it does indicate the fragility of the relationship in that clearly the Democrats mistakenly think they have only one ace in their hand, and that is the GST legislation, so they need to extract these commitments in relation to the GST legislation in order to get through the modifications that they believe rectify the many difficulties in this bill. But the reality is that from 30 June they are in the ultimate powerful position. The government is going to want a lot of things from the Democrats. We have the second wave of industrial relations legislation coming through, maybe as early as next week, and the government is going to want to have a talk to the Democrats about the second wave as well.</para><para>I hope the Democrats have had a rethink on that. I hope that they do not accede to the draconian legislation that Minister Reith is putting forward but, as Senator Quirke saidâand I think correctlyâwe do have a major shift happening in the political paradigm in Australia, in that what was for a very long time a left of centre party is moving to the right in political terms. That happened with the GST and it is now happening with this environment legislation.</para><para>I suspect it is a bit like when you first become a swinging voter. When you first break that traditional pattern and stop voting Liberal, Labor, Democrat, Green or whatever, you are basically a swinging voter for life. That is what is happening in politics these days and that is what concerns meâthat we do have this major shift in the political paradigm with the Democrats and we may see a continuing lurch to a more conservative party. </para><para>But I am here to talk about local governments, and I would like to say that this bill has been the subject of serious concern by a number of groups, a fact which has been raised by a number of people today. One of those groups is local government, which I do not think has got a mention to date. Local government is not just another lobby group, and I am not casting any aspersions on lobby groups at all. Local governments are actually involved in the delivery of services with regard to the environment, so they have a vested interest in relation to this, and they have direct responsibility for many of the environmental services that are delivered within our community.</para><para>Local governments play a significant and critical role. They are responsible for local planning and environmental management, standards of land management, conservation of native vegetation including off-reserve conservation, rehabilitation of degraded areas, urban conservation, eradication of weeds, pollution control and, of course, greenhouse gas reduction. All of those are the responsibility of local governments and they are responsible for delivering these programs to the community.</para><para>On this side of the chamber, we in the Labor Party have long regardedâand I think this is empirically provenâlocal government as a partner with the Commonwealth government across a range of policy issues. We have a long history of working with local government on national policy and, of course, it was Labor that first introduced Commonwealth funding for local government in 1973. Labor have always believed inâand in 1988 soughtâconstitutional recognition for local government, which was vehemently opposed by the current government, in particular Minister Reith, in the referendum.</para><para>We have also recognised local government's important role in the environment. In 1995, when Prime Minister Keating signed the firstâand so far onlyâpartnership agreement between the Commonwealth and local government, the Local Government Accord, the Labor Party formally recognised the vital role of local government in environmental management. That accord, which was a state 
 ment of principles and shared goals that would be pursued by the Commonwealth and local government in partnership, explicitly included a commitment to the protection of the environment and a recognition of local government's pivotal role in relation to that. In his speech to the National General Assembly of the Australian Local Government Association, the then Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said:</para><para>In all but a few areas of Australia's public life, the decisions of Local Governmentâand the quality of those decisionsâhelp determine our progress . . . It is most certainly the case with protection of our natural environment. I welcome your commitmentâ</para><para>that is, the local government representatives'-</para><para>to the protection of the environment. The Accord provides for an integrated approach to planning and development and to appropriate involvement in areas like waste management, sewerage, stormwater treatmentâissues crucial if we are to look after our rivers and our coasts.</para><para>That is quite correct. That historic accord, which, I might add, has completely dropped off the agenda of this coalition government, included as one of the shared principles underpinning the agreement `safe-guarding environmental quality and promoting ecologically sustainable development'. Schedule 4 of that agreement dealt specifically with environmental management and the view of the Keating Labor government was made very clear in that schedule:</para><para>The Commonwealth will:</para><para>support participation by Local Government as a partner in the development and implementation of national strategies in which Local Government has a legitimate interest by virtue of significant statutory responsibility or financial commitment and</para><para>. . . promote and enhance the role for Local Government in the implementation of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment.</para><para>This government, by contrast, regards local government with disdain. It does not recognise local government as a partner of the Commonwealth and repeatedly demonstrates its failure to grasp the role of local government in building our communities and in maintaining and protecting the environment. How often have we heard coalition members, particularly on Senate committees but also in here, describe local government as a creature 
 of the states? That is something which strikes horror, I must say, into the hearts of most councils.</para><para>I note that, despite local government's significant role in environmental protection, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, has not bothered to participate in this debate and has said absolutely nothing about local government's role in respect of this legislation. Let us not forget that this is the government that tried to palm off any semblance of a working relationship with local government by handing local government funding over to the states. In fact, Senator Macdonald tried essentially to do himself out of a job as minister for local government. I understand he was looking forward to a continuingâI will not say illustriousâcareer in other portfolios once he had managed to rid himself of this one and was utterly devastated by the arrangement with the Democrats in terms of the retention of local government.</para><para>In the end, of course, we saw the deal and we saw that the government was forced, kicking and screaming, by the Democrats to retain Commonwealth responsibility for local government fundingânot graciously and not with any real commitment to strong and effective local government. One thing this federal government fails to grasp is that local government is elected; it is actually elected to represent a constituency much as people in this chamber are but probably more equitably in many senses.</para><para>So it comes as no surprise that this bill contains no mention of local government and fails to recognise the responsibilities and regulatory powers of local government with regard to environmental management. It also fails to recognise local government's role in implementing national environment policies at a local level. Local government has been gradually and quite deliberately excluded from the process in the development of this bill. Its concerns have been ignored and once again it finds itself at the mercy of the states. This is something that Senator Hill did not mention in his answer to Senator Bolkus today in relation to exactly what the role of 
 local government has been in the development of this bill.</para><para>Local government over the past 20 years has taken a greater and greater role in environmental management and the implementation of national policies at a local level. Only seven months ago, the National General Assembly of the LGA endorsed a national local government biodiversity strategy. Local government worked very hard, in partnership with the states and the Commonwealth, to develop a formal strategy to preserve and protect Australia's biodiversity. It is somewhat ironic that local government took a national approach to biodiversity and environmental management at the very time that the Commonwealth was seeking to reduce its national responsibilities for the environment and shove them off to the states. That is absolutely ironic.</para><para>At the same time, the general assembly also adopted a unified approach to coastal management. Both these strategies are built on local government's national approach to the environment and its adoption of national policies on climate change and waste management in 1997. In a media release from the ALGA president, Councillor Campbell, he reaffirmed the need for cooperation on environmental matters between all three spheres of government. He said:</para><para>But local government cannot achieve sustainability on its own. What we need is effective and meaningful cooperation between all spheres of government to meet these important environmental objectives.</para><para>The national local government coastal management policy identifies the issues which constrain the involvement of councils in coastal management, and outlines the principles which we believe are central to an effective intergovernmental coastal management regime.</para><para>Similarly, the national local government biodiversity strategy, which was unanimously approved, has agreed that biodiversity conservation become a mainstream function of local government subject to adequate resourcing.</para><para>That is a caveat that needs to be there. He continued:</para><para>It recognises that the Commonwealth and state governments cannot achieve these agendas on their own because local government is generally respon 
 sible for planning and development control functions.</para><para>That is correct. He went on to say:</para><para>The strategy identifies the steps that need to be taken, the indicative costs and advocates partnership with the Commonwealth and state governments, to ensure our diverse biological heritage is protected and managed sustainably.</para><para>The Australian Local Government Association has raised some key concerns about the bill in submissions to the Senate committee and in an appearance before that committee. Key, of course, among those concerns is the failure of the bill to recognise the roles and responsibilities of local government as an environmental manager and often as the enforcer of environmental standards. It omits any requirement for preparation of statements and adequate consultation by state governments with local government in the preparation of bilateral agreements.</para><para>Local government, through the ALGA, was a full member of the intergovernmental committee for ecologically sustainable development until it was abolished by this government in 1998, and local government was a signatory, through the ALGA, to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. It was actively involved in the review of roles and responsibilities in the environment. It was that review that was to result in the development of the heads of agreement which would foreshadow amendments to the IGAE, and forms the basis of this bill.</para><para>ALGA pointed out in its September 1998 submission to the Senate committee that `the failings of the heads of agreement are reflected in this bill'. I understand that the heads of agreement still has not been signed by all the states. I also understand that local government's concern about the conduct and outcome of the so-called consultation processâand this has had a wide airing in the second reading debate speechesâthat has resulted in this bill is so great that ALGA has also refused to sign the heads of agreement.	 ALGA in its submission expressed disappointment at the failure of the review to recognise local government as a partner of the Commonwealth, states and territories in environmental management. In fact, the submission stated:</para><para>Regrettably, the review failed to address its task in the holistic way envisaged by the terms of reference, focussing instead on a limited number of intergovernment issues which might be characterised as Commonwealth-state demarcation disputes.</para><para>There we have it. The submission went on to say:</para><para>The review failed almost completely to address local government issues, again despite its terms of reference and despite a specific request by ICESD that the review consider the 1996 COAG resolution.</para><para>That COAG resolution, which arose out of the 1995-96 review of the IGAE, stated:</para><para>. . . ICESD examine and report on ways to ensure that the role played by local government in environmental management receives increased recognition and better implementation in terms of the agreement and that local government's role and involvement in processes to progress the objectives of the IGAE are clarified.</para><para>Local government, which was so actively involved in the beginning of the so-called consultation process which has led us to this debate today, has been gradually and not so subtly excluded by the Commonwealth and the statesâthe Commonwealth particularly. According to the ALGA submission, ALGA in 1997 did at one stage endorse the heads of agreement in principle, with two caveats: firstly, they would include a positive reference to the future implementation of the resolution on the need to enhance local government's role in the implementation of the IGAE; and, secondly, relevant schedules would require the states to consult with local government and prepare statements setting out the implications for local government.</para><para>The submission then went on to explain that, since the 1997 COAG meeting, further discussions took place between the Commonwealth and the statesâI think Senator Hill mentioned those todayâbut this time without local government, without the ALGA. As a result of those discussions, ALGA believes that local government's role was watered down significantly. At the general assembly in November last year, local government representatives from across Australia endorsed a motion that called for local government to be included in the legislation and to be consulted. That motion called on the federal government:</para><para>. . . to ensure that the role of local government in environmental management is appropriately recognised in the proposed new Commonwealth environmental legislation. In addition, this legislation needs to ensure that state-territory governments must enter into subsidiary agreements with the relevant state-territory local government association regarding implementation.</para><para>The ALGA is a cross-representation of not only local government but also the community. It is certainly not a front for any political party. It is very independent minded. But that was the ALGA's view on this legislation. Despite local government's numerous representations and repeated calls for recognition, there is no mention of local government in this bill. As I said before, despite the plethora of environmental activities that local government has to carry out, there is not one mention of it in this bill. Once again it has been completely ignored by the federal government. More importantly, I think the federal government has failed to recognise local government's contribution to national wellbeing and the environment in particular.</para><para>I will conclude as I started, with the Democrats. The Democrats should not think they are off the hook either on this disgraceful piece of legislation. I know that my colleagues have traversed that adequately. We have not yet had the opportunity to closely examine the Democrats amendments to this bill. If any belief is to be placed in Senator Bartlett's implicit threat before the dinner break of a guillotineâhe exhorted the Senate to hurry up and get onto the consideration of the amendmentsâwe will not get the opportunity for proper scrutiny. Let us not forget what the Democrats said in their local government fact sheet for the 1998 election:</para><para>Democrats' policy is to . . . treat Local Government as an equal partner with Federal and State Government in both the development of major national programs and reform processes.</para><para>I will wait with great interest to see whether the Democrats remembered local government when they did their deal with the government on this bill, or will it be a repeat of the tax deal where the Democrats promised so much and delivered so little?</para><para>Local government deserves a fair go and deserves recognition. It was involved in the 
 process up until very recently and then deliberately excluded in relation to that process. It has to be involved. It should be recognised in this legislation because of the services that it provides and the fact that it is a democratically elected sphere of government which deserves to be regarded as in partnership with the states and the Commonwealth government. As I said at the beginning, it is a sad indictment that there is no mention at all of local government in this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5979</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI begin by picking up on the closing remarks of my colleague Senator Mackay with respect to the Democrats' policy on local government. It would appear that, by virtue of their actions over recent weeks and particularly this week in regard to their approach to the legislation before this chamber, they intend to drag local government down to the same level at which this government treats the responsibilities of both federal government and state government. That would be a disaster.</para></talk.start><para>The  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]  and the  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999]  will have a significant impact in this country, not just in the immediate future but in years to come in the next millennium. Unfortunately, the significant impact it will have will not be one which enhances national responsibility and national protection of the environment. Rather its significance will be that it will mark the point where the national government wound back the clock on responsibility for the environment and for heritage.</para><para>This is a government which looks backwards. We have a Prime Minister who looks back to the 1950s and the 1960s, a time which he thinks was a golden era in Australia. He longs for those days and makes no secret of it. Unfortunately, he translates that view about this great nation into many areas of public policy and responsibility of his government. We have seen it in health and education and we are now seeing it in the environment. This Prime Minister longs to devolve responsibility back to the states in important areas such as the environment where we have man 
 aged to bring about consistency and uniformity in the national interest and in the interests of the globe.</para><para>This legislation will undo all of the effort undertaken over the last 16 years across the political spectrum in order to protect our environment, our native flora and fauna and our national heritage. It will certainly undermine the national interest. The basis upon which this government puts forward this legislation is contained in the second reading speech of the minister, particularly with respect to the references to the COAG agreement. In that speech the minister said:</para><para>The <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  implements the COAG agreement. In doing so, it provides the framework for a more effective national approach to environmental management, ensuring resources are focused on delivering better environmental outcomes at all levels of government. The Commonwealth's role in this national approach will, for the first time, be clearly and logically defined.</para><para>The bill will replace five existing Commonwealth Actsâthe Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983.</para><para>That is a very noble statement. It would be wonderful if it were true but, of course, it is not. Shortly I will demonstrate why not. In what can only be the height of hypocrisy, the speech goes on to say:</para><para>As a result of the previous Labor government's neglect, the Commonwealth's environmental law regime has not evolved to keep pace with the rapid advances in environmental management.</para><para>If you look at the paragraph which I quoted a moment ago, you will see the five existing Commonwealth acts that will be replaced by this bill. In just about every case, they are bills that were passed by Labor governmentsâthe Whitlam government and the Hawke and Keating governments. As everyone in this country knows, it was the Labor governments at the national level which finally took a stand on the big environmental issues facing this country in the 1970s and particularly in the 1980s.</para><para>I hear Minister Vanstone laugh as she enters the chamber. Where was the minister when the Franklin Dam was proposed to be built? Which federal government was it that took on the state government in Tasmania, irrespective of whether it was a Labor government or a Liberal government? It was the Hawke Labor government that took on that issue in the national interest, won it and used Commonwealth powers under the external affairs powers to stop that disgraceful project. It was a project which everyone today recognises should never have been on the drawing board. What was the reaction to the coalition parties at that time? They ran off to the High Court and challenged the Labor government's use of the external affairs powers and other powers to stop that project.</para><para>It was the same attitude that they adopted to some of Gough Whitlam's earlier legislation, particularly with respect to ensuring appropriate control by a national government over our offshore waters. The first chance that they could get they were off to the High Court to challenge the use of national powers in that regard. Each of the pieces of legislation replaced by this bill, with the exception of one, was passed by a Labor government. And the minister has the hide to allege neglect by a previous Labor government!</para><para>When we were seeking to put those pieces of legislation into law, when we were seeking to protect the Daintree, the Franklin River, the forests of the Lemonthyme, Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef, what was this mob on the other side trying to do? Stop us at every turn. Premier Bjelke-Petersen took us to the High Court. God knows what would have happened if he had had his way. There would be oil-drilling rigs up there now on the Great Barrier Reef. That was the policy that he supported. Yet you have the hide to come into this parliament and say that you are somehow fixing up neglect by previous governments. What an absolutely ridiculous allegation to make.</para><para>What you are also doing is, as I said, continuing a philosophy that your Prime Minister is hell-bent on, and that is to reduce, as much as possible, national responsibility for the big issues. We have seen his failure on 
 issues such as  indigenous affairs, when the coalition parties did not like the decisions of the High Court so they tried to subtly undermine themâindeed, at the end of the day, they were not so subtle. Again, they wanted to devolve more responsibility to the states in that area.</para><para>They have done the same thing in health by cutting funding across the board: `Oh, this is a job for the states to look after,' they say. It is the same with education: `Oh yes, we'll let the states do it. That is their responsibility.' It is similar with regional development. The previous minister for regional development in this government said that there is no place for the national government in the area of regional development. What an attitude to adopt in 1999 to the great issues that affect regional areas across this country, many of which involve environmental degradation. Of course, we are seeing it again in this area of the environment.</para><para>I concede that there is a need to get some uniformity in the environmental laws that apply. But we also know that we are faced with certain constitutional difficulties. Firstly, there is the situation that the Commonwealth does not have a direct head of power to intervene to protect the environment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âNeither do the states.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âSenator Margetts intervenes and says `Neither do the states.' Of course, we know that one of the difficulties is that it is the states that essentially have control of land management in this country. As I reported earlier with respect to some of the issues that were prominent in Gough Whitlam's timeâincluding disputes over the control of territorial watersâthis government wanted to give those powers back to the states. And we have had to rely upon the external affairs powers. We have had to rely on the powers over export and import, and over corporations, in terms of some of these activities as well. So there is a need to try to codify the law. But the bill that has been put before this parliament does not do anything of the sort; it actually represents a complete abrogation of responsibility. It hands back to the states essentially unfettered control.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Whilst there may be provisions in the bill which refer to areas of national heritage, we need to consider the bill in detail. Hopefully, if we get sufficient time and the guillotine is not applied again, those deficiencies will be exposed. As Senator Bolkus outlined in his opening remarks on behalf of the opposition, there is a plethora of areas where this bill is deficient and where all we have is mealy-mouthed words and very little by way of substance in terms of the Commonwealth being prepared to positively and directly intervene to protect the environmentâa position that we were always prepared to adopt when it was in the national interest. 	 The other point that I wanted to make in reference to the COAG agreement is that the government says that it bases this legislation upon the Commonwealth heads of government agreement. Yet it was in that process that some 30 areas of national significance were identified by the Commonwealth and the states as requiring specific reference, specific identification. But this legislation identifies only seven such areas. None of the substantial areas such as climate change, greenhouse gases, soil salinity, air quality, inland water pollution, land degradation and forest management is directly addressed in the legislation. There is a huge void in what this legislation spells out in respect of those areas of national significance on which this government and future federal governments would be prepared to take action. There is little detail on the bilateral agreements proposed between the various levels of government. Senator Mackay, as I said earlier, has referred to the fact that local government is not even mentioned. Yet local government increasingly has a role in respect of environmental protection. After all, local governments exercise many of the planning laws around this country.</para><para>I can recall a major dispute only a couple of years ago on the north coast of New South Wales where there was a proposal from the Liberal government under Mr Greiner, and then under Minister Fahey, to locate a sewerage plant at what is called the Look-At-Me-Now Headland near Coffs Harbour. That was supported by the National Party and it was supported by local government interests up there. Fortunately, the community and later 
 the NSW ALP government recognised what an absolutely absurd and disgraceful proposal that was and stopped it. That area is now on the edge of the Solitary Islands Marine National Park, but they wanted to stick a sewerage plant right on the headland.</para><para>That is the sort of activity that has to be able to be stopped. One could go on and on, as other speakers have identified, regarding all those areas of macro significance, such as the Daintree and the Franklin Dam. One could talk about the very many other areas that are very important, that may not be on the national spectrum in terms of their environmental significance but that still need to be protected.</para><para>These bilateral agreements really would be a bit of a sham. There is little room for public consultation and involvement in conservation agreements. We have seen the attitude that this government has adopted to public consultation. They have allowed for very little public input in respect of their decision to build a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. When requests are made under freedom of information legislation for material as to how some of these decisions were arrived at, `Sorry,' the government says, `it is cabinet-in-confidence, and we can't tell the public about that.' One could point to a range of similar instances. The Hinchinbrook proposal in Queensland is another that comes to mind. And, of course, Senator Bolkus particularly drew attention to the disregard for the rights of indigenous people under this legislation.</para><para>Unfortunately, this legislation continues a sorry tradition of this government in abrogating its responsibilities at the national level. Of course, that is their approach. As I said, they cut funds to the states and then they say, `You look after that area,'âwhether it be health, education or family services. They cut the funding to that reputable organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has come out and slammed the Democrats for getting into bed with the government with respect to this legislation. Frankly, handing back direct responsibility in so many areas to the states is a prospect that I tremble at, given the sorry record of many state governments in the past on this issue.</para><para>I conclude by referring to that rather overused word in the political lexicon, `vision'. We hear references to `vision' all the time and, in many cases, I have to concede that it is inappropriately used and overused. But if there is one issue where one can legitimately talk about governments needing vision it has to be in the area of environment and in the protection of our environment and heritage, because that is the legacy that we leave for future generations.</para><para>Unfortunately, we have a Prime Minister, as I said, who believes that vision is irrelevant, that we have to look back and not forward. I notice that Senator Quirke in his remarks referred to Neville Chamberlain, a man who I do not think could be described as having a terribly good concept of vision. I am actually reminded of the closing words of <inline font-style="italic">The Great Gatsby</inline>, where Fitzgerald wrote:</para><para>And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matterâtomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further . . . And one fine morningâ</para><para>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</para><para>John Howard is rowing the boat and taking us back into the past, and the Democrats are in there with him.

I can only echo those words strongly, because that is precisely what it is. Those from my side who have preceded me this evening in the debate on the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  have clearly shown that the Democrats have no understanding of what negotiations are about and what is required to get a deal where you are in a win-win situationâbecause in this case there is no doubt 
 that, for the second time around, they are in a win-loss situation.</para></talk.start><para>The first major stumble that they had was with the first wave of the so-called industrial relations. We have had even Senator Murray stand up in this place and complain about the fact that they were dudded and taken to the cleaners, and that they did not realise what their negotiations were about and what they were agreeing to. I think that is the outcome of what we see before us here tonight. I do not believe that the Democrats really understand what they have done.</para><para>The second bad deal that they made was with the GST. The deal with respect to the legislation now before us brings up No. 3, and so they have got the trifectaâand that is nothing to be extremely happy about, even if you were a punter. Of course, they have taken the odds here and they have lost. They have deserted their own constituencyâand that has been clearly brought out by my colleagues who have spoken in this debate. They, who are the great ones to get out there and claim that consultation is necessary and imperative and that there is a great need to consult with not just peak organisations but also the great amorphous mass out there, have deserted those people that they claim to represent and that they claim to in some way represent in this chamber. They have absolutely abrogated their responsibility to those people in nothing but the worst of ways, because they have taken a decision which will affect dramatically the outcome for the future of the environment of this nation.</para><para>My friend Senator Quirke alluded to the fact, quite clearly, that Senator Lyn Allison had complained about the secrecy of the COAG agreement on 27 April, and yet here we are on 22 June and any problems with the secrecy that surrounded the COAG agreement seem to have completely evaporated. Of course what has happened in the meantime, in becoming part of the process, is that she has cut herself and her party off from the consultative process with those people which they so ably claim to represent.</para><para>I have had some experience in this parliament on the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts 
 References Committee. At the behest invariably of the Democrats I became involved in a number of references on environmental matters. To that end, I have a great interest in the environment; always have had. Many people would be surprised at the very good track record I have on the environment at a federal level.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âYou may well say that: I could not possibly comment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âI will divulge it for you later, Senator Margetts. I participated in an inquiry on marine and coastal pollution. I participated, in part, in an inquiry into the Hinchinbrook project. I participated in a reference committee hearing in the early stages of this bill, before it ended up at the legislation committee. I have had the pleasure of travelling to many parts of Australia with those inquiries. One of the significant parts of those inquiries was that wherever one went one found that the Democrats had lined up a number of witnesses to appear before the inquiry. That is fair enoughâall the parties line up witnesses, but the Democrats were particularly energetic, particularly emphatic about having their constituent groups appear before the committee and have their voice heard as part of a broader consultative process.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course, I listened to all of these groups and had the opportunity to question them. At the end of the day what we found was that these people were satisfied that they had been heard. They had been consulted. Of course, this was undoubtedly the major thrust of many of these inquiries as far as the Democrats were concerned. They would line up their supporters and where their supporters had to register outrage they did. There is no doubt that the Democrats carefully stage-managed the appearance of their colleagues, of their fellow travellers, at the various venues, and for that I give them credit.</para><para>Nonetheless, when it comes to a most important issue of an environmental nature before this parliament, a major bill, what do we find? Without any consultation at all, as best as I can understand, the Democrats go down the path of deserting their constituency and go straight to a sweetheart deal with the 
 government. How the supporters of the Democrats must feel used and prostituted by the process of the Democrats, who have offered them so much but, in effect, delivered them so little. At the end of the day, the Democrats have been found to be wanting and this is highlighted by the deal that has been consummated with the government on this environment bill.</para><para>I have a practical concern rather than an emotionally driven concern, as I perceive a number of the Democrats have. The Democrats have run their race on emotion and have been found wanting when it comes the practicalities of this legislation. There is no doubt that this legislation is nothing more than a great number of words put together by some spin doctor but, at the end of the day, it will have very little or no practical effect because it takes away the influence and the power and the right of the Commonwealth government to have an overarching role and say in environmental matters. What we will see as a result of this bill are lower standards rather than higher standards.</para><para>If one turns to the second reading speech, one finds that it is at odds with the so-called direction that the federal government are stating that they want us to take, and that their partners, the Democrats, want us to take in this area. I refer to the fourth paragraph of the second reading speech, which says:</para><para>Over the last two years, the Federal Coalition Government has worked co-operatively with the State Governments to identify the reforms needed to produce a more effective and efficient national approach to environmental management.</para><para>Note the words `national approach'. That is the focus of the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline> . Further down in the next paragraph it repeats a similar sentiment where it says:</para><para>In doing so, itâ</para><para>`it' being the billâ</para><para>provides the framework for a more effective national approach to environmental management.</para><para>In two paragraphs we get hit with the concept of a more effective and efficient national approach and the words `provides the framework for a more effective national approach'. Of course, the very last thing that this bill 
 does is give a national approach. It abrogates national responsibility. It takes away the responsibility of the federal government. It reduces the responsibility of the federal government and tries to push the power and responsibility back to the states.</para><para>In my view, that is the complete opposite of where this bill should be heading. As I understood the original Democrats position, it is the complete opposite of their view. From what I understand of their early position in this bill, they have done a complete about-face. Everything seems to be heading in the direction of the state government. As some of my colleagues quite clearly alluded to here earlier this evening, the track record of state governments is not good, particularly if you come from a state such as mine, the state of Queensland, where we had a conservative government for many years under the rule of the Hon. Joh Bjelke-Petersen as Premier. The more you could knock down, the more trees you could remove and the more land you could clear, the more you were rewarded. As one of my colleagues said, we would have had mining rigs on the Barrier Reef had it not been for other circumstances taking place.</para><para>There is no doubt that going down the path of handing the power to the state governments is not a good way to be going. Their track records leave a lot to be desired. This has come out in a number of inquiries I have participated in with the Senate Environment References Committee. A genuine concern for our environment has been expressed by many interested people, not just the so-called greenies, that state government can be too reckless in its capacity to handle the issue of the environment.</para><para>It was expressed loudly and clearly on numerous occasions that the issue was best left with the federal government. State government is seen as being preoccupied with business initiatives, development projects and employment generation. Some of those things of themselves are not bad; they are not wrong. However, when you have them and the environment is either being pushed out the back door or is not being given even anything near an equal rating in decisions, one has governments totally preoccupied with a make 
 or break attitude to development at all costs and the attitude `hang the environment'.</para><para>In the second reading speech, we heard about the so-called national approach. However, the bill requires the powers to go back to the state. If the powers go back to the state, what will we end up with in the states and territories? We will have six states, two territories and eight agendas. We are not going to have one national agenda. If the Democrats think otherwise, they have pipe dreams. There are various demands in the various states. They might be based on their coastal nature or their rural or regional nature or on tourism or general demographics. We are not going to see a national approach in any way.</para><para>The opening few paragraphs of the second reading speech on this bill claim to have identified reforms to produce a more effective and efficient national approach to environmental management. However, it produces nothing but a diverse range of views that will be at least eightfold. By the time you include in the equation the influence of the various local government areas, you will probably find a real grab-bag of environmental agendas in the various states. Far from having a national approach, we will have a very diverse approach.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum refers to a number of matters of national environmental significance that will impact on the involvement of the federal government. It is interesting to read division 1 on page 21 of the explanatory memorandum:</para><para>This Division applies to an action that has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on one or more of the matters of national environmental significance.</para><para>That is fine; they are nice words. As I said earlier, this has been put together by the word spin doctors. What construction is to be put on `significant impact'? What is of significant impact to one is of no impact to another. What is of importance to one group has absolutely no meaning elsewhere. It goes on:</para><para>The matters of national environmental significance areâ</para><para>and it gives a broad listing. World heritage properties can be reasonably defined, as can 
 Ramsar wetlands of international importance. I would like to see the definition of `nationally threatened species and communities'. `Migratory species protected under international agreements' is reasonably defined.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âWhich migratory species?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>âAre we protected?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âYou're not protected, Senator George Campbell.

It knows no boundaries; it knows no laws. It is a national problem.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Does it have a significant impact? Does it come under the significant impact that would require the federal government to become involved? It is very much open to question. There is no doubt in my mind that the agenda that is being set here is one that will see a lot of blurred edgesâthere will not be clearly defined involvement by the federal government when it is needed and as it is required. The vast majority of people in this nation are simply untrusting of state governmentsâthey 
 do not trust the state governments in these areas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>5985</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]</inline>  was most aptly described tonight on one of the news programsâI think it was on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline>  programâas `a start of the race to the bottom in environmental standards'.

Other environment groups are also impressed.</para><para>Who are these other environmental groups? I heard Senator Allison today, when addressing this issue, talk about the support they had from environmental groups, but I also noted that Senator Allison was very careful not to identify the other environmental groups that were supporting this legislation or that have supported the package negotiated by the Democrats. When you compare what is contained in the press release put out by the Democrats with what the reality is, you have to say that they would have been better off 
 including a photograph at the top of the page of Senator Hill, entitling the document <inline font-style="italic">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</inline>  and putting in the song, `Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work we go.' It would have been as constructive and as intelligent as the contents of this press release are.</para><para>What is the environmental movement saying about this legislation? A press release was put out by the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society which said a few things about it, and I will come to that in a moment. I got some material in my office the other day from Greenpeace. They made three very important points in relation to this legislation and the material that they distributed. They said:</para><para>It is our view that this legislation should be postponed for major surgery or otherwise rejected by the Senate.</para><para>You would have to say when you look at the legislation that Senator Herron and Senator Eggleston combined could not save it. The following point in the material from Greenpeace is very important:</para><para>The legislation should reflect the Commonwealth's extensive powers, should fully reflect our international obligations andâ</para><para>more importantlyâ</para><para>should treat the Australian environment as a whole, rather than artificially dividing at State boundaries.</para><para>All major environment groups in Australia have expressed deep concern about the new legislation and the process by which it was developed.</para><para>In the press release of 21 June, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace Australia and the Wilderness Society said:</para><para>At the beginning of this century we created a nation from a collection of coloniesâthis Bill returns us to the days of different laws for different States. This does not provide the right legal basis for good nation-wide environment laws and standards.</para><para>I think that is very true. A number of my colleagues, when making their contribution in this debate, have referred back to some of the experiences we have had in this country over the past 20 or 30 years when the control of environmental laws was firmly in state hands. We had the debacle over Fraser Island. We had the proposals by Bjelke-Petersen to mine or to drill for oil on the Great Barrier Reef. 
 We had the flooding of the Franklin and all of those issues. Does anybody think it would be any different in the next century? Would anyone really entrust the environment of Western Australia to Premier Court? Would anyone really entrust the issue of capping the water supply through the Murray to Premier Kennett? Would anyone really entrust environmental issues in South Australia to Premier Olsen? I do not think so. I do not think that anyone who has any respect at all for the environment would want to entrust those individuals with making decisions that would be in the interests of the environment in those states.</para><para>The state and the nature of our environment is not just a state issue. It is a national and an international issue, and we need to be a nation that has strong environmental laws that are able to be enforced nationally, that can play a constructive role, that feed into international laws, and that protect the environment for all of us.</para><para>One has to say that the Democrats have got themselves into a real muddle in political terms. In the past couple of weeks they have moved from being the party of principle and the party that operated on the motto `Keep the Bastards Honest' to actually joining the bastards. They have become the political polluters. They have polluted the tax environment with their GST, which will finally finish upâif things go as predictedâbeing passed through this parliament. They will not be able to walk away from that and they will not be able to get rid of the odium of it; and nor should they be allowed to. They are now about to pollute the environment by putting legislation through that, in the longer term, will work to the opposite of the interests of the people they say are their core constituency. When you look at the experience of the past couple of weeks, it has clearly emerged that we have a team of players over here on my left who, when it comes to negotiating anything, are really babes in the woodâpardon the pun. They were taken to the cleaners with their eyes open and without really knowing it had happened.</para><para>I used to play a bit of cards in my younger days; I suspect Senator Quirke also did, 
 coming from the same part of the world. We had to try to get a quid in whatever way we could, and cards was one of the ways we did it.

They were sitting with the unbeatable hand; they were sitting with the opportunity to do something really constructive, and they folded the opportunity. I have been involved in politics for some 35 years in this countryâa little bit longer if you add my involvement elsewhereâand I have seen a lot of situations where individuals or groups have sold out for 30 pieces of silver. But I have never seen a situation, ever, where a group were prepared to sell out for two brass pennies. That is what the Democrats got for delivering the GST to this government, and that is what they will get for delivering this polluted environmental package of legislation to the people of this country. It is an absolute disgrace. What they have done, to put it in cricket parlance, is a Herschelle Gibbs. They took their catch and threw the ball away. They threw the ball away before they had it securely in their hands and before they used it constructively.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You have to say that it gets a bit wearying at times in this chamber. Over the past few months we have seen Senator Allison in particular, who is the Democrats spokesperson on environmental issues, come into this chamber at question time, and at every other opportunity, and raise issues relating to the environment. She badgered Senator Hill almost continuously about what was happening at Kakadu. There was a constant onslaught on Senator Hill, the environment minister, about the evils of the government and its policy on Kakadu. That was their approach on that issue, and it was constant over a whole period of time. It would not surprise me if we were to see, over the next couple of months, a reversal of that situation. It would not surprise me if one day we were to turn on the evening news and see Senator 
 Hill and Senator Allison strolling arm in arm through Kakadu, through Ranger, tiptoeing through the uranium tailings up around that area. That is how close the Democrats have come to the government in terms of delivering their environmental policy. They will have delivered the very policy that they have been saying was deficient and for which they have criticised Senator Hill and his government over many months.</para><para>The Democrats are becoming a bit like a bird which we used to be fond of years ago. It was known as the hoof and dinger bird. It was a bird that used to continuously fly around in ever-decreasing circles and eventually disappeared up its own passage. In political terms, you would have to say that is a reasonable description of where the Australian Democrats sit at the moment in the political environment. They are gradually shifting their support base into tighter and tighter circles, and it is not too far from disappearing from under them.</para><para>It is particularly galling to see a party like the Democrats, who have made their promotion of environmental issues an absolute virtueâwherever you go, they have been the purest of pure in pursuing those issuesâbeing prepared to sell out those principles and destroy those commitments as part of a wider deal which involves a GST but is all seen in terms of them delivering their own political relevancy. But you have to say to yourself: relevancy to achieve what? I think it is very true, as someone else said in this debate earlier, that they have gone the full circle. They have gone from being a fracture of the conservative coalition in this countryâestablished by Don Chipp for his own political agenda at the timeâright across the political spectrum through to trying to position themselves to the left of the Labor Party and other progressive parties in this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âThat wasn't too difficult at the time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âNo, everything is relative, Senator Margetts, from time to time. I am often surprised about your position on some issues when you have moved to that side of the chamber, contrary to where we thought you might have been. 
 But everything is always relative in politics. They positioned themselves to the left of the political spectrum and, all of a sudden, they have taken a gigantic leap back onto the conservative side of politics.</para></talk.start></continue><para>They have hitched their wagon firmly to this government. Whether or not this government survives will, to a large extent, determine how they go in the political future. But they will never be able to get up again in this chamber or anywhere else and lecture us, the Greens or any other political party about being virtuous, about holding to our principles, about not being prepared to sell out and about putting principle beyond pragmatism and do it with any degree of moral authority, because the public and their own support base will not wear it.</para><para>The public clearly understands what the Democrats have done in this debate on the environment and in the debate over the GST. Whatever way they mask it, whatever types of press releases they put out, whatever headings they put on those press releases, at the end of the day they have, for very little gain for their own constituency, assisted this government in delivering its agenda. At the end of the day, the very people whom they purport to represent in this whole process are the people who will suffer as a consequence of the political actions that they have taken. They will have to answer for that. They will have to come to grips with the decisions that they have taken in that context.</para><para>I am one of those who believe that it will not be long before the political retribution is delivered. It will not be long before the next election. It will not be long before their swollen numbers that will be here in 10 days time are whittled down considerably as a consequence of the positions that they have adopted over the past couple of weeks on these important political issues for the Australian public.</para><para>It is unfortunate in many respects that they are not here to hear some of the comments that have been made by other senators in this debate. But I presume they are off doing their little negotiations in secret and putting together their little packages of deals. Maybe 
 they are off trying to read what it is that they have agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âAnother deal.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âOr maybe, as Senator Quirke says, there is another deal in the offering on some other piece of legislation that we are not conscious of. I happened to see Senator Murray on the way down here to the chamber and I noted he was heading in the direction of where the Prime Minister sits in this building. So maybe there is another little deal in the offering, or maybe he is just going down to see what the package is that they agreed to and what the government has come up with in terms of delivering that particular package.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are all waiting to see it. We are all waiting with bated breath to see the translation of the heads of agreement into a legislative program. I would not be surprised if Senator Hill is sitting there with bated breath to see the amendments that are proposed to the GST package or maybe to see even what the amendments are that are proposed to this package. Maybe they have not been finalised yet, Senator Hill. Maybe they are down having a cup of black coffee in the cabinet room or over in the Lodge trying to work out the finer detail. But you do not have to worry, because there is one thing that has been demonstrated beyond doubt over the past couple of weeks: whatever you negotiate with the Democrats, it will not cost you much at the end of the day. You will not have to pay much to achieve the outcomes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>5988</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn closing the debate, can I, in accordance with the usual courtesies, thank senators for their participation. I have to say, however, that much of it was a very disappointing debate. Senator Campbell's last contribution typified what I heard from so many Labor speakers today. He is capable of much better. Listening to him basically attempting to fill up his allotted time because he had been instructed to stretch out this debate really was very disappointing, verging, I would have to say, on the pitiful.</para></talk.start><para>These tired old warriors are fighting the battles of the past. We heard it all during the 
 course of the day: the battle of the Franklin, the battle of Shark Bay and the battle of Fraser Island. Those in the Australian Labor Party and those in the Australian Greens really wish that they were out there on the campaign trail, climbing the trees and blocking the bulldozers and doing what they do best. Of course, that was the era of the 1970s and 1980s. That was the era of confrontation. That is when legends were made. That is the era that these people in the Australian Labor Party and in the Australian Greens still live in. That is where they would like to be again. But the trouble is that the world has moved on and Australia has moved on, and the environmental challenges facing Australia are very different now from what they were in those days.</para><para>The biggest change, of course, is community attitudes. The community is now much better informed. The community wants to act in an environmentally responsible way. It wants governments to show the lead and to support it in so acting, but it is out there taking the right decisions. The days when it was necessary to confront the community to try and achieve a particular environmental goal are well past. I concede that there were some achievements in those days, but there was a lot that is regrettable about it as well. If some on the other side went again to Shark Bay, Fraser Island and the like, they would still find community members deeply embittered by their experiences of the past. These people now want to work with governments and with community organisations to achieve better environmental outcomes.</para><para>The second line from the ALP today in this debate has been to come in here and attempt to humiliate the Australian Democrats and in fact to attempt to intimidate them. It seems to me from observations of the last few weeks that they are not so easily intimidated. It is pleasing to see that the Democrats have moved on and that the Democrats now recognise that the community does not want to fight environmental battles in the way they were fought in the 1970s and 1980s. The community now wants to put in place a contemporary legislative scheme within which everyone knows their rights and responsi 
 bilities, in which governments can provide the proper leadership that is necessary and within which the users of that legislation can be certain of and comfortable with the processes that are before them. In other words, it wants a regime that can achieve better environmental outcomes. It is pleasing to see that the Democrats recognise that fact. It is also pleasing to see that some within what is referred to commonly as the conservation movement also see that it is time to move on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>âNot many.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>âIt is time to strike out, Senator Bolkus, in a new direction. It is time, as I said, to work cooperatively rather than confrontationally. You see, Mr Deputy President, practically everyone except the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and a few of the fringe organisations that still are part of the Senator Bob Brown grouping actually recognises that the existing system of environmental law in Australia has served its time and is now outdated. It is basically broken, and it is time to devise a new environmental structure in law that can reflect the challenges of the future rather than just the challenges of the past.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When this new government, as it then was, addressed this issue, it saw the obvious deficiencies of the existing Commonwealth law. There was not even identified with that law something that we would recognise as of national environmental significance. The triggers were indirect triggers that had no relationship to particular environmental issues at allâtriggers such as whether the Commonwealth government was to take an action such as approve a foreign investment. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>I was just pointing out the obvious deficiencies of the current Commonwealth legislation in relation to the environment. For example, if a development in a world heritage area threatens some environmental value, why should it make a difference if it is being funded by overseas money rather than local money? Why should one trigger Commonwealth legislation and responsibility and not the other? It is just a nonsense. How could we have got to the stage at the dawn of the new millennium where the environment minister 
 in this country does not even make environment decisions? Environment decisions are still made, under Commonwealth laws, by so-called action ministers. I would have thought that the Australian Greens would be in here demanding contemporary environment laws for this country. But of course they are not interested in the structure of government; they are not interested in the cooperative models. All they are interested in is confrontation and trying to relive the battles of the past and what they would see as some of the victories of the past.</para><para>The hypocrisy of the Labor Party in these environmental issues knows no bounds at all. We were being slammed a moment ago in relation to uranium policy. Under the Australian Labor Party there was a greater expansion of uranium output in Australia than at any other time in the country's history. And we get the hypocrisy of Senator Bolkus, for example, leading the ALP's charge to condemn the Jabiluka mine in the Kakadu area, having been in a Labor government for 13 years which turned a blind eye to Rangerâthat huge open-cut uranium mine only a few kilometres away from the small underground modern Jabiluka diggings. The hypocrisy of Labor in this whole debate is extraordinary.</para><para>What I was saying was that when this government came to office it saw these obvious deficiencies and said it was time to reform Australia's environment laws and put in place something contemporary that could provide the standards and the practice that would be necessary for the next 10 or 20 years in this country. We recognised that it needed to be done within our federation. There are some who keep talking about the dream of a national environmental law or a takeover of the states. It is an old dream of the ALP's and an old dream of Senator Brown's, but it is really not going to work.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âYou can do it for big business but not for the people.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>âI will talk about big business in a minute. You have to work with the existing system, the existing federation, to identify what is the appropriate role for the Commonwealth and what is the appropriate role for the states and how they can then 
 work together to achieve the best national outcomeâsomething that I would have thought was pretty obvious, something that can achieve a lot better outcome than the existing legal structure.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We set about that negotiation. In 1996 we published the discussion paper and entered into a negotiation with the states to identify what are matters of national environmental significance for which the Commonwealth should take primary responsibility, what other matters should be primarily dealt with by the states and then how we can put that into practice to see that it works to its maximumâin other words, how we can use the capacities of both the Commonwealth and the states to deliver a sound and effective system. So we said that, where the states are better equipped to carry out assessments for the Commonwealth in these matters of national environmental significance, they should carry out that assessment, provided they do so under both law and practice that meets best contemporary standards. In other words, the Commonwealth should be able to accredit processes of the states to assist the Commonwealth in meeting its responsibility, provided the standards that the state is operating under are those that the Commonwealth would wish to see for itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âMore ecowaffle.

This government wanted to make it work well so we negotiated with the states and we set out a framework for this new national system of environmental protection. For Senator Brown's benefit, for the first time we also included a bill for biological conservation in this country to protect our biodiversity. Its time had come. Regrettably the Australian Labor Party, although it had entered into the international convention on biodiversity and the national strategy, had not 
 got around to upgrading Commonwealth law in this regard.</para></talk.start></continue><para>After the COAG agreement was negotiated and agreed we went through a process of fleshing it out with further discussion papers involving all of the state playersâthe states, the conservation groups and industry. We took on board their advice and developed this bill. This bill then went through almost 11 months of assessment by this chamber through its committee process. Again, the committee moved around Australia and took the advice of the various interest groups that wanted to put a particular perspective on this matter. Out of that came a very helpful report which has enabled us to finetune the bill that is before the Senate tonight.</para><para>Not surprisingly, after taking into account the Senate's report we took into account submissions that had been made direct to us, again by the various state players. We had further meetings with state ministers. We met with industry. We met with conservation groups. We met with indigenous groups; Senator Brown, that may not be of interest to you. We met with the indigenous groups and we worked on a package of amendments that could improve the bill that we first introduced. We are very pleased to have now before this chamberâfinally, after a process that started in 1996âa bill and amendments that we believe can provide for Australia that contemporary system of environmental law.

I have to say that, in my observation, the attitude of business to environmental matters has changed substantially. Business in Australiaâindustry in Australiaâwants to cooperate. Industry in Australia says, `We will accept high and demanding environmental standards but we want certainty. We want a process that we know will not be duplicated by the Commonwealth and the states, that has strict time lines and that is usableâthat, in other words, is user friendlyâso that we can achieve the certainty we need in which to conduct our businesses.'</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Farmers have a particular responsibility but also a particular challenge in this area. We made a lot of mistakes in this country. Farmers cleared land that should not have been cleared. It was the community's responsibility in many ways, because we provided land for them on the basis that they cleared it and we told them it was necessary to clear and to develop or perish. Mistakes inadvertently were made. Farmers are now seeking to remedy those mistakes and new farmers are endeavouring to not repeat those mistakes. It is possibleâfor the benefit of Senator Brownâto work cooperatively with the rural community to achieve good environmental outcomes, and some 4,000 Landcare and community environmental groups who are out there doing the good works on the ground now have become the leaders of the environment movement in Australia. That is something that Senator Brown hates but it is also part of the new reality.</para><para>I am saying that the attitude of the community has changedâindustries want to work with governments on better environmental outcomes and they want to achieve win-win situations.

In the few minutes that I have left, I want to touch upon a few specific matters in relation to this package. There has been a debate during the course of the day about the triggersâabout what are appropriate areas of national environmental significance. It is true that that was a negotiation with the states and it was limited by that negotiation, but it is possible for the Commonwealth to introduce new triggers. Senators in this place might be aware that this government has already made a commitment to enter a process of negotiation with the states on the issue of greenhouse gases, for example, as a matter of national environmental significance consistent with the COAG agreement. That will be commenced forthwith upon the passage of this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are new areas that people are recognising in which the Commonwealth has a particular responsibility. Genetically modified organisms is one such area and, as honourable senators will know, this government is setting up the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator within the department of health to provide approvals. What I can say to the Senate tonight is that matters that affect the environment will be referred to the environment minister for assessment and advice by that independent regulator. That will ultimately be provided for through an amendment to this legislation, when it passes, in conjunction with the law that is going to be put in place to set up the new GTR.</para><para>There are many reforms within this package to support indigenous Australians. They do have a particular knowledge and contribution to make in relation to Australian biodiversity. Somebody said in this debate earlier today that there should be an advisory body of indigenous Australians. In the amendments before the chamber, we set up such an advis 
 ory body. But one issue that needs further assessment is the issue of access to biological resourcesâa highly complex issue of particular concern to indigenous Australia. Although it is not within this bill, I will cause an inquiry to be undertaken to give indigenous Australians and all Australians interested in this issue the opportunity to participate in a public debate so that the issue of access to biological resources can be further developed.</para><para>Another issue that has been dealt with during the course of the day is that of bilateral agreements. It is true, as I said, that through bilateral agreements we will allow the states in certain circumstances to carry out assessments and, in very confined areas, very limited areas, even approvals if it is under a management plan that has been part of the whole process as developed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Margetts's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>21:56:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

That bill, which forms part of the fundamental reform of the Australian tax system, introduces reform and improvements to the assistance currently provided by government to families. From 1 July 2000, gone will be the 12 conflicting and overlapping family payments. Instead, there will be three well designed, harmonised and generous benefits that will make a positive impact on the living standards of Australian families, particularly those with low incomes.</para><para>The A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) bill 1999 contains administrative, procedural and technical rules that will apply in relation to the new family assistance paymentsâfamily tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and child care benefit. The bill will also include machinery type provisions dealing with two other family-related payments, maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance.</para><para>I consider that it might assist this House if I were to provide an overview of the delivery of the family assistance package.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">A new `Family Assistance Office' will be set up to help families</inline></para><para>The new Family Assistance Office will deliver family tax benefit (parts A and B), child care benefit, maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance. The law does not refer to the Family Assistance Office as it will be a `virtual' 
 organisation using the existing infrastructure of Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office and the Health Insurance Commission (Medicare Offices). It is expected that all Australian Taxation Offices, all Centrelink offices and all Medicare offices will have a Family Assistance Office as part of their office. The extended network of sites will ensure families have a greater choice about the way in which they access assistance.</para><para>In order to give families these choices, the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services will have the power to delegate his or her powers to constituent agencies of the new Family Assistance Office. The heads of these agencies and their staff, as delegates of the Secretary, will be able to process claims, make payments and perform other functions under the family assistance law.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Making a claim for Family Tax Benefit</inline></para><para>The primary carer will be able to make a claim for family tax benefit in one of the following ways:</para><para>lodge a claim with the Family Assistance Office (through Centrelink) for fortnightly payments; or</para><para>claim a lump sum payment at the end of the year (through the taxation system), either through the primary carer's tax return or their partner's tax return. Families will have a further option to reduce their (or their partner's) tax instalment deductions during the year in anticipation of their end of year family tax benefit lump sum entitlement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Making a claim for Child Care Benefit</inline></para><para>Families will be able to claim child care benefit for formal care (in approved child care services) in one of the following ways:</para><para>as instalment payments paid directly to their nominated child care service to enable the service to reduce the fees that the family will pay (current arrangements under which child care assistance advance payments are made to child care services will be preserved for child care benefit purposes. This will be achieved by regulations); or</para><para>as a lump sum after the end of the financial year (from the Family Assistance Office).</para><para>Child care benefit for informal care will be claimed as a lump sum for a period of care of up to 12 months and paid via the Family Assistance Office.</para><para>Child care benefit will not be delivered through the tax system because of the complexity of the information parents would need to retain to be able to correctly assess their entitlement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Making a claim for Maternity Allowance and Maternity Immunisation Allowance</inline></para><para>Families will be able to claim single, one-off payments of maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance from the Family Assistance Office (through Centrelink). 
</para><para>Like child care benefit, maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance will not be delivered through the tax system.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Families will receive their correct entitlement to family assistance</inline></para><para>Families who choose to receive fortnightly payments will estimate their income for the current financial year. Their estimated income will be compared with their actual income at the end of the year. Families who have overestimated their income during the year and have been underpaid will receive a `top up' payment at the end of the year. On the other hand, families who have underestimated their income and have been overpaid, will be required to pay back the amount they were overpaid during the year. This is much fairer than the current arrangements for family allowance where families who underestimate their income are required to pay back the amount they were overpaid but families who overestimate their income during the year do not receive a top up payment. It is also fairer than the current arrangement for child care assistance where families do not receive a top up payment if they are underpaid, and are not required to pay back overpaid amounts.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Administrative arrangements for Maternity Allowance and Maternity Immunisation Allowance</inline></para><para>The administration of these payments will not change significantly under the new family assistance regime.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Administrative arrangements for Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Benefit will be simplified</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Simpler rules will be administered by one agency</inline></para><para>Rather than dealing with potentially 12 forms of assistance with different eligibility rules and payment arrangements through three different agencies, families will now have to deal with only 3 payments with similar eligibility rules and with one agency, the Family Assistance Office.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Same rules for all families</inline></para><para>There will be one set of rules for all families regardless of how they choose to receive family assistance. For family tax benefit, this means that regardless of whether families receive fortnightly payments or as an end of year lump sum claimed with their tax returns, they will all be subject to the same eligibility criteria, rate calculators and administrative arrangements under the family assistance law. For child care benefit, regardless of whether families receive ongoing payments or lump sum payments from the Family Assistance Office (through Centrelink), the same eligibility rules and rates will apply.</para><para>Under the new arrangements, decisions made by the Secretary regarding entitlement to, or eligibility 
 for, family tax benefit and child care benefit will be reviewable by the Secretary, or an authorised review officer, regardless of delivery option. It is expected that where family tax benefit is paid through the tax system, the Commissioner, as delegate of the Secretary, will carry out the review functions for those customers. There will be further rights of appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. Rules explaining the process for review of decisions are set out in Part 5 of this bill and will be kept separate from the Australian Taxation Office appeal and review process. Determinations made by approved child care services regarding child care benefit in special circumstances will not be reviewable. Approved child care services and registered carers will also have the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about the Secretary's decisions affecting them, except where the decision is the result of a Commonwealth planning strategy affecting the distribution of child care places.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">It will be easier for families to repay overpayments</inline></para><para>As family tax benefit is partly administered through the tax system, overpayments of family tax benefit will be recovered from a claimant's tax refund where possible. This bill will also allow another person, for example the claimant's partner, to make his or her income tax refund available to offset a claimant's family tax benefit debt. In such cases, where consent is given, the Commissioner will apply the partner's income tax refund to reduce or extinguish the claimant's family tax benefit debt. The new administrative arrangements for recovering overpayments of family tax benefit, will make it much easier for families to repay a family tax benefit debt. Where it is not possible to recover overpayments of family tax benefit from the taxation system, and for overpayments of child care benefit, these will be recovered by the Family Assistance Office under existing Centrelink arrangements.</para><para>Since child care benefit will not be delivered through the tax system, tax refunds and debts will not be applied against child care benefit debts and payments. Also other family assistance overpayments will not be recoverable from child care benefit. However, child care benefit overpayments will be recoverable from family tax benefit or from social security payments.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Family Tax Benefit paid through the tax system will be a payment, not a tax rebate or an increase in tax free threshold</inline></para><para>Although claimants will be able to lodge claims for family tax benefit and receive lump sum and top up payments through the taxation system, the family tax benefit entitlement will not be in the form of a 
 tax rebate or an increase in a person's tax free threshold.</para><para>Traditionally, measures like family tax benefit (such as the family tax assistance) have been provided as tax rebates or as an increase in a person's threshold where the rate of family assistance is calculated by the Australian Taxation Office and offset against tax payable.</para><para>A similar approach was not adopted for family tax benefit because the administrative mechanism of delivering family tax benefit through a person's income tax assessment would have been very complicated and families would not have been able to benefit from the simpler structure and administrative arrangements of the proposed system (for example, it would not have been possible to ensure that all families receive their correct entitlement regardless of delivery option) which is the main feature of family assistance reform.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE) (CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL (NO. 2) 1999</para><para>This bill accompanies the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Consequential and Related Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999 and the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999. Together, they will facilitate the introduction of the new family assistance package from 1 July 2000.</para><para>The bill:</para><para>amends a number of Commonwealth acts that refer to concepts and terms that are relevant under the existing family assistance structure and repeal or amend the references to reflect the new family assistance regime;</para><para>provides for the appropriate calculation of family tax benefit part A for those recipients in receipt of income support (or whose partners receive income support);</para><para>allows the use or disclosure of information by or between the three agencies involved in the transition to the new family assistance regimeâCentrelink, the Australian Taxation Office and the Health insurance Commissionâfor the purpose of identifying shared customers (so that customers receive only one letter about the new arrangements instead of, potentially, three); and</para><para>makes some other minor technical amendments.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>5996</page.no><id.no>s182</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>5996</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5996</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

What has been established is that this is monumental legislation as far as the future of Australia's environment is concerned. There are different points of view on that. Senator Hill said that there are rumours about the place, and he was referring to the use of the guillotine. I would like to know from the government and the DemocratsâSenator Woodley is in his place; there is only one there nowâwhat the agreed procedure 
 and time allocation for the debate on this legislation in the next 24 hours are. We have a right to know that. If the government and/or the Democratsâbecause they will need to work together on thisâare going to use the gag, I suggest, first of all, that we come to recognise that fact and that then we get some orderly process in place so that the truncated debate that will take place can take place with all the important matters we need to discuss at least getting some airing.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5997</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne thing I do agree with is that this is monumental legislationâvery important in the national interest. I am pleased that that has been recognised by Senator Brown. He might also recognise that it is long overdue. It should have been introduced by Labor a decade ago but they could not pick up the ball, they missed their chance, and the natural resource assets of Australia suffered as a result.</para></talk.start><para>Having said that, I remind Senator Brown that this has been a process of some 2Â½ years, a long process, and it is now time to put a bill into law. The Senate itself has had the matter before it for many months. I think that the Senate committees had the bill in total for about 11 months. After that level of consultation and consideration by the parliamentary process to date, it is not the view of the government that this should necessarily be a very long debate, Senator Brown. The issues are well known. The Senate committee has reported. Many of the suggestions of the Senate committee have been taken up by the government in its amendments that are now before the chamber. There are actually only a limited number of issues that really need to be debated at the committee stage in this chamber.</para><para>So I would not think it would take a very long time. I  know that the Senate is also anxious to get on with debate on the new tax reform package, which is also a monumental piece of legislation by a reformist government, Senator Brown, and a package of legislation that I hope Senator Brown will also support a little later in the week. It is not the intention of the government to take any 
 process tonight which might curtail debate, but by tomorrow it may well be necessary to seek from the Senate some form of time management process in order that the debate can be contained within a reasonable period. I do it for the benefit of all honourable senators, because otherwise we will all have to sit here for two weeks listening to Senator Brown, and that would be unfair on all except the Australian Greens. So the government may seek some mechanism in the morning and invite the Senate to join with us to restrain this debate to a reasonable period of time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>5998</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government does not have the numbers to gag this debate, but Senator Hill has made it abundantly clear it is going to gag the debate tomorrow. What I want to know is: what are the poodles doing? What are the Democrat political poodles in this situation going to do as far as this gag is concerned? There are two of themâSenator Allison and Senator Woodleyâsitting here. There are many people listening to this debate who want to know what these political convenience people over here who are selling out on the environment are going to do with respect to Senator Allison's assurance that this legislation was important because it would give full transparency and public consultation. With the government they have brought 400 amendments in here tonight. These have not been on the public record before today.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats are assuring us that they are in the business of full transparency and public consultation. If that is the case, there is no way that they are going to support a gag tomorrow. Senator Margetts points out that there are 900 amendments here. What I want to hear from Senator Allison and Senator Woodley is that they will not be part of a gag of this important debate. The minister says it is monumental legislationâfor exactly the opposite reason. But we want to hear from the mendicants at the prime ministerial tableâthe sell-out merchants hereâhow far they are actually going to sell out on this debate. I now invite Senator Allison and/or Senator Woodley to have the gumption to get up and tell this place what they are going to do 
 tomorrow as far as the guillotine on this legislation is concerned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5998</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I have a question to you, too, and I wonder if you might consider it along with Senator Brown's question.

Let me put on record why I believe that leave should not be granted in respect of this. This is becoming past a joke. We in the Senate tonight have been asked to address some 906 amendments: 569 all-up from the government, 277 from the opposition, 50 from the Greens and a paltry 10 from the Democratsâ906 altogether. As the minister said, under time management we can expect to finish this debate probably some time tomorrow. On any analysis, we have been asked to consider 906 amendments at something like 20 seconds per amendment. But not only that: we have had 5Â½ hours since the government's 511 amendments were actually tabled in this place.</para></talk.start><para>Were we to have spent all the time on analysing those amendments, we would have had some 40 seconds per amendment during that periodânot allowing for dinner breaks or whatever. That is 5Â½ hours for 511 amendments, with 40 seconds to analyse each and every one of those amendments. It is a joke. It makes a joke of public accountability and a joke of the parliamentary process. I must say that, from my 18 years in this place, I do not think this place has ever been asked to stoop to the standards that we are seeing tonight.</para><para>The government, after a secret deal hatched between themselves and the Democratsâthose lapsed environmentalistsâare coming in here and asking us to approve some 569 amendments, 511 of which are part of that secret arrangement. And now the minister says to us, `Let's deal with them in a batch.' Let us look at the batch that he has asked us to deal with them in. He must think that basically we are all asleep on this side of the parliament, in the press gallery and out in the community. Let us look at the first batch of (10) to (71). He says that this has been prepared by the Senate office. I do not know if it has been with or without instruction or suggestion, but look at (10) to (71): what have all those amendments got in common?</para><para>Let us look at them. Amendment (10) relates to something technical in respect to 
 actions requiring approval for the purposes of Part 3. We need to spend some time on that. Clause 13 refers to declarations under the world heritage act in respect of world heritage property. Clause 13 talks about strengthening protection of matters of national environmental significance. Then we have a subpart of amendment 13 which, I must say, goes to clauses 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 34, 38, 47, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67. So, within one amendment, the minister is asking us to look at some 15 different clauses. Within all that, there is the concept of criminal prosecution and criminal penalties being attached to some offences. What has that got to do with world heritage? We may well ask. The next clause, clause 14, goes to maximum penalties of seven years imprisonment and so on. We are not dealing with light matters here.</para><para>We are not dealing with similar matters when the minister has asked us to address all those amendments together. For instance, clause 16 refers to declaration of a wetland as a Ramsar wetland. That also is something that needs particular attention. Clause 17 is on nuclear installations, and the amendments make the definition of a nuclear installation consistent with the definition used in the ARPANSA legislation. That is another matter which also requires attention.</para><para>From Ramsar we go to nuclear, and then in clause 18 we go fishing. Minister, what are you trying to get at this evening, asking us to address all of these in one batch? Clause 19 talks about adding new matters of national environmental significance by regulation. Clause 20 is in respect of regulation. Now those two might go together, but then clause 21 goes to the minister's power to specify that an action on Commonwealth land does not require approval under Part 9. Then clause 22 is on national interest. So we have gone from fishing to the national interest: not even Warren Entsch can do that on one day, but we have been asked to do it in this place tonight.</para><para>Then we go on to activities and decisions, technical terms, and conducting of reviews every five years. Luckily we get a recognition in clause 25 of a process for public consultation. That process for public consultation has 
 attracted so much attention in the committee process, through the digest process and through the work done by the Parliamentary Library, and yet we are asked to lump that in one batch with all the other matters: heritage, fishing, nuclear, public consultation.</para><para>Some of these matters may sit easily together but I have only gone through about 10 of the clauses and the minister has essentially asked us to address some 170 clauses together in one batch. What always comes out about this minister is he always does it with a straight face. I have not gone anywhere near the full extent of the amendments that we need to discuss tonight. There is the concept of the Auditor-General and also lost and locked in these amendments is the joint management arrangements of Booderee National Park, Uluru and Kata Tjuta National Park and Kakadu National Parkâall of which have attracted a great degree of attention in themselves.</para><para>Not only that, we have been presented today with a set of bodgie and dodgy documents from the Australian Democrats saying that they have protected indigenous Australians, that they have done great things for indigenous Australians because they have defended the joint management arrangements in respect of those national parks in the Northern Territory. Have they protected them! If this is the sort of protection you get, don't let me rely on Democrat protection at any time in the future. What protection have they given them? They have got in their documentation three concepts of protection. Not one of those concepts tells the truth. Concept one up-front in their press statement is that they are defending the joint management arrangements and resisting Northern Territory government representation on the joint management boards. Midway through their documentation they say the indigenous representatives, the traditional owners, will have the right to refuse Northern Territory representation but they cannot be unreasonable about it.</para><para>In the middle of the documentation they say the appointment of a Northern Territory representative on the boards of Kakadu and Uluru national parks is now subject to the consent of the traditional owners, which may 
 not be withheld unreasonably. That is what they want us to believe. That is information they have sent out to those people in the conservation councils around the country that they want to con, and are they conning them! When you go further in their lists of achievements, what do you get? You get a regime that is documented that says traditional owners can resist a representation of the Northern Territory government but, in the event of a protracted dispute, the Commonwealth ombudsman will investigate and make a ruling. The minister may terminate the appointment of a non-indigenous representative on the board if they are not acting in the interests of the board. So basically this right of refusal by traditional owners, indigenous owners, has been diluted to the Commonwealth ombudsman investigating and making a ruling. What sort of protection is that? Senator Woodley is here. Senator Woodley has got great connections with indigenous Australians but why try to con them?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7Y6</name.id><name role="metadata">CROSSIN</name><name role="display">Senator Crossin</name></talker><para>âAnd the TOs have agreed to that, have they, Senator Bolkus?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>âI do not know if they have or not.

In writing you said that. What was the next thing they heard from you? The legislation changing those joint management arrangementsânot only without their consent but without their prior knowledge and without prior consultation. Let us put on the record that consultation is pretty important. This is one of the 160 to 170 amendments that this minister wants us to debate in one batch.

This is the aim of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which is now operating in 60 countries. Jubilee 2000 was started in the United Kingdom in 1990 by a number of individuals who believed that radical action was needed to address the devastating impact of Third World country indebtedness to the world. They identified the year 2000 as a useful focus for a campaign calling for a one-off remission of debt along the lines of the Jubilee year described in the biblical book of Leviticus.</para></talk.start><para>The term is used throughout the old and new testaments and other religious teachings. The practice of usury is regarded right throughout as a repugnant term and a repug 
 nant practice towards one's fellow man. The aim of the Jubilee 2000 charter is, firstly, to liberate the poorest nations from the burden of the backlog of unpayable debtâI emphasise that it is unpayable debtâowed by their governments to other countries, to international financial institutions or to commercial banks. It aims to achieve such liberation and a return to sustainable development through an unrepeated one-off remission of unpayable debt of the poorest countries by the year 2000. It also aims to provide a focus and catalyst for harmonising and mobilising international cooperation in supporting actions to promote and achieve the charter's aim. It also seeks to promote understanding among creditor nations that the responsibility for high levels of indebtedness rests with creditors as well as with debtors.</para><para>The Jubilee 2000 debt coalition is a practical solution to the problem that has been affecting hundreds of millions of people for over 15 years and will only succeed if we have wide public support. Debt is a crippling fact in the existence and persistence of poverty in so many Third World countries. One billion people are trapped in poverty, and they can do nothing about countries trapped under a mountain of debt that they can never pay back.</para><para>In the 1970s, Western banks lent huge sums to Third World countries in the hope that the countries would use the funds to boost exports and to make profits. Unfortunately, interest rates rose rapidly with spiralling debt repayments and the price of primary products often fell to 30 per cent on average, thereby considerably reducing the incomes of Third World countries. Another factor was expenditure on armaments often used to prop up despotic dictators. The result was that the poorest countries in the world began earning less and less and had to pay more and more.</para><para>Today, many of the poorest nations are even deeper in debt than they were when they first took out the loans because of the impact of interest. Although they may have repaid much more than the equivalent of the original loan, their total debts continue to rise. The influence of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the policies of devel 
 oping countries is immense. Because of this, they too have a key role. In 1992, they stepped in, giving debtor countries more time to pay. Accepting their condition has meant that Third World country governments had even less to spend on their own people.</para><para>In Africa as a whole, for example, four times more is spent on interest than on the health care system. In the world's 37 poorest countries, spending per person has gone down 50 per cent on health and 25 per cent on education. In Tanzania, where 40 per cent of people die before the age of 35, debt repayments are six times more than spending on health care.</para><para>Jubilee 2000 proposes to celebrate the new millennium by cancelling the unpayable debts of the world's poorest nations. They have worked with economists, business people, politicians, diplomats and aid agencies to design a practical proposal balancing the interests of both the debtors as well as the creditors. So the Jubilee 2000 plan is to identify the poorest debt burdened countries and to calculate the debt of each country that could never be repaid. They would then negotiate conditions to remove this debt on a country by country basis, ensuring that the world would benefit.</para><para>In arriving at this decision to remit the burden of the backlog of unpayable debts to the poorest countries, arbitrators would take into account for each debtor country that country's probity, economic management, social policies and human rights record. Debt remission would be made conditional upon governments utilising the financial resources that become available for investment in basic human needs. Targets for improving access to primary health, basic education, water and sanitation will be established along with the costs of meeting them. The debts would be cancelled by the end of the year 2000 as a once-off celebration of the millennium.</para><para>Supporters are indeed wide ranging, including the Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, the Baptist churches of Australia, Caritas Australia, Community Aid Abroad, the International Federation of Free Trade Unions, the International Union of Physicians, World Vision and many more. International patrons 
 include Susan George, the Associate Director of the Transnational Institute, and Desmond Tutu, the former Archbishop of Capetown. Australian patrons boast the Most Reverend Keith Rainer, the Archbishop of Melbourne; the Anglican Primate of Australia; Professor Clifford Hughes from the Department of Surgery at the University of Sydney; and the much respected Reverend Tim Costello, who is incidentally the brother of Australia's Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello.</para><para>Over 35,000 children die each year from hunger related causes. One and a half billion of the world's population live on less than $1 per day. I believe that we could all help by making donations to Jubilee 2000 and by telling others about Jubilee 2000, including its aims.</para><para>I also take this opportunity to ask Western governments, including our own, that are not prepared to go to the full extent of writing off the debt to make a gesture of concern and goodwill and at least use this important occasion to perhaps venture even a small or a token write-off of part of the debt. This would be a great gesture. In fact, the write-off is not as unrealistic as some might think, given the almost impossible position of so many of these nations that are not really in a position to pay off that debt in any case. Why not write off a portion of it as a gesture of goodwill in celebration of the 2000 millennium?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology: Equity of Access</title><page.no>6003</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>6003</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is opportune to be able to rise this evening to address the Senate in regard to some rural and regional information technology challenges in particular. It is opportune for several reasons, including recent media reports which listed the world's richest people according to <inline font-style="italic">Forbes</inline>  magazine. Few would be surprised that Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, gets a guernsey heading the list, but of particular interest was the inclusion of a Japanese businessman, worth an estimated $9.77 billion, who evidently has a larger proportion of the Internet economy than any other. It is amazing, considering that 10 years ago the industry was virtually unheard 
 of and certainly would not have been viewed as being capable of generating such an enormous amount of wealth.</para></talk.start><para>All around the world, individuals, companies and countries are grappling with issues surrounding an industry with this capacity, and Australia is no exception. It is especially true that Australia has the potential, as my colleague Senator Tierney pointed out earlier this year in a speech in the chamber, to `become the information hub of South-East Asia'. Look at Australia's take-up of technologyâ1.27 million Australian households were online last year, an increase of almost 50 per cent in 12 months. That equates to 4.2 million Australian adults having access to the web, making it the third-highest per capita user of the Internet after Finland and the United States. It equates to 4.2 million Australians having access to a range of services, information sources and retail outlets through e-commerce which previously were less accessible.</para><para>E-commerce is without doubt a growth area, but it is not the only element of the growth of the information economy with which we should concern ourselves. There is a plethora of issues associated with the Internet and other innovations which need to be dealt with for Australia to make the most from these emerging industries and technologies. One of the most important challenges is to ensure that all Australians, especially those across rural and regional areas, can benefit from these innovations. We should remember that, whilst all Australians face particular challenges in incorporating new technologies into their lives or their businesses, those in rural and regional areas often face greater and more varied challenges.</para><para>In reading some of the range of literature that abounds in this growing area, I looked at an article from an edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Economic Development Review</inline> in 1993. In an article entitled `Rural economic development using information age technology' the authors commented on what they described as  the `potential to alleviate rurality as a barrier to job creation' as a result of the manner in which new technologies can overcome issues of geographic location. There is no doubt that 
 this is a true statement. The potential of the Internet and e-commerce to make distance almost irrelevant is enormous, but it is up to those directing the growth of these areas to ensure that the benefits are enjoyed by all.</para><para>When the West reportâthe government's review of higher education financing and policyâwas released last year, there was much discussion of the use of technology in education. The report noted the potential and increasing role that technologies such as the Internet might play in furthering education. There is enormous benefit to be gained from the Net in terms of breaking down problems of access to education. The possibilities are endless. That raises one of the most pressing challenges in relation to rural and regional use of ITâthat of ensuring that access to the necessary technologies that will allow them to benefit fully from such innovations. It can be as simple as ensuring access to a computer and a telephone line, but it is also about issues that relate to telecommunications and education. Those issues are magnified by the challenges of distance and isolation.</para><para>It is not restricted to Australia. In the United States, President Clinton has raised similar concerns and committed the US government to:</para><para>. . . hook up every school and every library in this country . . . to the Internet and to make sure that all the schools and all the libraries in the smallest, poorest rural areas and the most densely populated poor urban areas . . . will all be able to afford to use this invaluable service.</para><para>Access to technology is not the only challenge facing our increasingly technological world. Ensuring that people have access to information technologies and that they also have the understanding and the motivation to utilise those technologies is just as important. Everybody knows that a computer is useless unless the people sitting in front of them know how to use them and, most importantly, know how to use them to their advantage.</para><para>In a report on Australian IT and rural development in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science</inline>, comment was made of the enthusiasm with which Australians have embraced innovations as simple as mobile phones or VCRs, but there was also a 
 reference to the `relatively low adoption'âin this case, by farmersâ`of computer technology, particularly in comparison to their urban business counterparts'. The point was made that international developments across a range of areas indicate that it would be beneficial for Australian primary producers to utilise new technologies. The challenge for government is to ensure that those in rural and regional areas are motivated by the benefit that they may derive from the use of technologies, understand how to implement them in an appropriate manner and have access to what is required to effect that implementation.</para><para>As rapidly as the technologies have become available, there have been individuals and organisations seeking to deal with challenges specific to bringing those advances to rural and regional areas. Most importantly, there have been those who have sought to meet such challenges, not just in relation to economic gains which might be made but also in relation to social gains.</para><para>I have referred previously in the Senate to an organisation called Reach Out, which has been focusing solidly on the challenge of providing online advice to young Australians who might be at risk of suicide. Triple J listeners have heard all about Reach Out and recent listeners in particular will be familiar with the Reach Out Rural and Regional Tour which has been occurring recently. The big RORRT, as the project has become known, involves Reach Out representatives travelling across the state to schools, TAFEs and youth centres promoting the organisation and the benefits of Net access for those young people who might require their services. Reach Out also plans to provide free Internet access terminals in different parts of the state, to be accessed by those who might not have ready access in other places.</para><para>The coalition have recognised many of the challenges that I have outlined, and we have implemented a number of initiatives and programs aimed at ensuring more equitable application of IT across the country on a broader level. One of the important initiatives was holding a series of regional summits. The summits were launched in conjunction with the release of a policy paper, `Towards an 
 Australian strategy for the information economy.' Many summits, including one in Penrith in greater Western Sydney, where I am based, were conducted across the country throughout last year, and there are plans to hold several more. They are a crucial way of ensuring that regional communities explore the opportunities and the benefits that are to be gained from the Internet and the emerging online economy, hand in hand with the government and the National Office for the Information Economy.</para><para>Another significant initiative is the Networking the Nation program, which will ensure that Australians can enjoy the benefits of improved and increasingly varied telecommunications services. The government realised that gaps between the quality and cost of these services in metropolitan and non-metropolitan Australia needed to be addressed and introduced a program to fund increased telecommunications infrastructure across the country and specifically in rural and regional Australia. Funding is open to a range of projects, including those that focus on the provision of one-off infrastructure development, those that trial new innovative technologies, and those that involve assisting communities in identifying needs for particular telecommunications services and uses as an element of an overall project. They might focus on, for example, improving access by removing the STD charge for rural and remote access to the Internet, promoting awareness of online services, providing training, or even providing assistance for start-up or relocation and training costs of establishing communication network assistance services.</para><para>As I have suggested, the government have recognised, in a number of areas, the specific needs of rural and regional Australia in regard to information technologies and, through Networking the Nation, aim to ensure that individual communities can reap the benefits available through new technology.</para><para>It is worth while noting briefly the breadth of projects that have been funded under Networking the Nation. In the latest round of grants, announced on 1 June, a diversity of projects received funding. For example, Reach 
 Out, the organisation to which I referred earlier, received a sum for Reach Out Bush Network, to build technology resources for young people in rural areas across New South Wales. In my region of greater Western Sydney, TRI Community Exchange received support to develop a comprehensive and dynamic regional intranet and associated training for the community services sector, which will be extended to 12 local government areas in central western New South Wales. In other areas of the state, the projects have been just as impressive. In Cobar, the Cobar Community Development Station Inc. received funding to set up an Internet cafe, with the aim of providing Internet training and awareness raising for business and social use.</para><para>This is technology which has the capacity to deal with the worldwide population and economic drift towards major cities that has been occurring for most of this century. It may even address some of that trend, and addressing that would allow rural areas to compete with urban areas on a level footing across a range of issues. How we as a government, but particularly as a nation, approach these emerging challenges will be the measure of how successful we are in the information age.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra Sale: Social Bonus</title><page.no>6005</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6005</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust 24 hours ago, this Senate passed the bill which will allow the further 16.6 per cent sale of Telstra. That will deliver, to rural and regional Australia in particular, a $1 billion social bonus, and that is undoubtedly welcomed by those living in regional areas of Australia. In particular, my home state of Tasmania has received a generous, albeit much needed, contribution from that social bonus. The mobile phone access and computer access for regional areas, particularly in my home state of Tasmania, is most welcome.</para></talk.start><para>I believe people are entitled to ask why the Labor senators and the Greens senator from Tasmania voted against these proposalsâproposals which include the important upgrading of the Tasmanian Athletics Centre, where 
 the facilities were, quite frankly, of Third World standard. Approximately 20,000 school children per annum access those facilities, but Labor and Greens senators wanted to deny those Tasmanian school children the right to those proper and decent facilities. The Bill Barwick International Athletics Centre, as it will be called, will receive a major boost with a contribution of $600,000. Similarly, the Tasmanian people are entitled to ask why Labor senators and the Greens senator from Tasmania voted against the proposal which delivers the sealing of the Flinders Island airstripâan important matter for those people living on Flinders Island.</para><para>Indeed, the question has to be asked: why did the member for Bass also vote against this proposal? The question can also be asked: why did the members for Braddon and Bass and the Labor senators from Tasmania seek to deny the people of King and Flinders Islands a proper mobile phone service? Sure, they enjoy the mobile phone service, living in Launceston and Burnie in my home state, and when they come up to Canberra they can always use their mobile phones. But the people who live on King Island and Flinders Island in Bass Strait do not have such a privilege, and these Labor members and senators would seek to deny them that opportunity.</para><para>The most bizarre thing of all is the Greens senator's opposition to the $25 million boost to the Natural Heritage Trust funding for Tasmania. If one is committed to the environment, as we are led to believe the Greens senator is, one has to ask: why is it that he would seek to deny the Tasmanian environment $25 million worth of repairs? The reason, quite simply, is that his left-wing ideology of government ownership is a lot more important to him than the bottom line of fixing the environment. One could also ask: why is it that the Labor members from Tasmania, the Labor senators and the Greens senator opposed the extra coverage that will be provided for SBS television to remote areas, including areas in Tasmania?</para><para>There is no doubt that this package will be of major significance to Tasmania. It is a major boost. But when the test came, Labor 
 Party members and senators from Tasmania slavishly followed the party line rather than being concerned about the best interests of the people whom they are elected to represent. In recent times we have had a Labor campaign seeking to deflect from these excellent outcomes for Tasmania by suggesting that there have been job losses in Telstra. There have been no job losses in Tasmania in relation to Telstra. The numbers are pretty well even; indeed, there may have been a slight growth.</para><para>But all that aside, the simple fact is that any rearrangement of jobs within Telstra is a function of the competition policy which the previous Labor government introduced. It has nothing to do with privatisation. Indeed, with our policies of pursuing privatising and seeking to make the telecommunications industry even more efficient, there are today now more jobs in telecommunications than there were when we first came into government. So the furphy that the Labor senators are trying to introduce into this debate is something that they need to live with, because in fact it is a function of competition that they themselves whilst in government introduced into the marketplace.</para><para>I am, along with the vast majority of my fellow Tasmanians, absolutely delighted with the package that the federal government was able to put together in relation to the sale of Telstra and the $1 billion social bonus from which Tasmania benefits so greatly. Yesterday I had the opportunity to put on the record, via ABC radio to listeners in New South Wales, the reason that Tasmania is so deserving of extra funding from a social bonus. It should be remembered in this place that, as a result of decisions taken by former Labor governments, a major power development in my home state was blocked, then the development of a major pulp mill was blocked by federal Labor and 40 per cent of our landmass has now been locked up as part of the world heritage areas introduced by Labor.</para><para>Those three decisions, designed to get Green preferences on the mainland, have had devastating social and economic consequences for my fellow Tasmanians and the economy of my home state. Unfortunately when you take those decisions it takes some time to 
 wash through, but the people of Tasmania are now suffering with population decline and the highest rate of unemployment in the nation. We were told that we would never need that extra power supply. We now have a strange twist of politics with the Labor Deputy Premier coming up to Canberra seeking federal assistance to get a gas pipeline across Bass Strait to assist with the power needs of Tasmania. That is the problem of a lack of forward planning and short-term decision making by federal Labor trying to get Green preferences at the expense of the Tasmanian people, and it is now having a devastating impact on my home state. It is therefore appropriate, when moneys are freed up through this sale of Telstra, that from that social bonus an extra portion be paid to Tasmania to make up for those horrendous decisions taken by the Labor Party against my home state since 1983.</para><para>The people of Tasmania welcome this package overwhelmingly. They are absolutely devastated to think that Labor senators and Labor members of the House of Representativesâto a man and womanâvoted against this package when they know the desperate need for Tasmania to be provided with this money which has been so well targeted. These are initiatives that show that a lot of thought went into the package and identified needs and possibilities for Tasmania to become a more self-sustaining economy. I, for one, welcome the announcements that were made over the weekend and the passage of the further partial sale of Telstra by this Senate yesterday evening, and the people of Tasmania are very pleased by the decisions taken by this Senate and the federal Liberal government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Further Sale</title><page.no>6007</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>6007</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was not intending to speak this evening, but I think there should be some analysis of some of the comments that have been made by Senator Abetz and other government senators about the Telstra package that was negotiated by Senator Harradine. Let me say at the outset that, when I was first given to understand the nature of the package, it seemed to be a package with a lot of merits 
 for my state. But I guess I, like a lot of other people, can be dazzled at first glance by the impact of the package of measures which have been negotiated and, without thinking the matter through, come to a quick and probably wrong conclusion. I was startled to hear one of my colleagues from the other side of the chamber tonight talk about the package in terms that suggested that, within five years, its value would be greatly diminished. Looking at that package in light of those comments, I had to come to the view that that senator was, to a great extent, correct.</para></talk.start><para>I am concerned about a number of aspects of the package, and I am particularly concerned about the way that it is received by other Australians. I think it is unfortunate that it has been suggested that this is the package that will make Tasmania an intelligent island. I was heartened by comments in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> today which suggested that the island was indeed already an intelligent island. The fact of the matter is that a lot of the people who have gained their qualifications have had to move to mainland Australia to obtain employment which is commensurate with their skills and education. That is the problem: not making Tasmania an intelligent island. So I say that that is an unfortunate epithet.</para><para>I am very concerned about the way the package has been received elsewhere. The editorial in today's <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> is edifying, and I want to quote from that. It says, under the heading `PM in Grubby Vote-Buying Politics':</para><para>The Howard Government has resorted to shabby vote-buying to try to secure the passage of its Telstra legislation through the Senate. Its brazen inducements to Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine to support the sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra reveal an administration driven by the dangerous idea that the end justifies the means. And Senator Harradine seems all too ready to sell his vote if the price is right for Tasmania.</para><para>Prime Minister John Howard says Tasmania needs a bit of help because it has the highest unemployment level in Australia and not much industry. That is humbug. If Mr Howard believed that Tasmania needed special help, why did he not provide it earlier? He left it to the eve of the Senate vote on the Telstra sale to promise a special deal for 
 Tasmania. And he has made the extra money for Tasmania conditional on the Senate voting for the sale proposal. Again, if Tasmania's needs are so overwhelmingly pressing, then it should be helped regardless of what happens to Telstra.</para><para>Quite right.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âDo you oppose the deal?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âSenator Abetz is interjecting. I listened to him without interruption and I would ask him for the same courtesy. Today in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> , on page 18, the editorial, which supports the package, says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley is absolutely correct. The Telstra sale deal stitched up by Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine with the Federal Government is shameless pork-barrelling. The deal will probably upset most mainlanders but it will delight the majority of Tasmanians.</para><para>There are quite a number of articles in today's papers about the deal, and almost without exception the comments from outside of Tasmania are deprecatory about the deal, particularly the proportion of the social bonus that Tasmania has achieved. I do not oppose any of the initiatives per se. Given that you are going to put together a package of measures, some of them, I suspect, if there was going to be a proportionate distribution of the social bonus, would have gone to Tasmania, though obviously the proportion is in excess of its population base.</para><para>Let me ask these rhetorical questions, and perhaps Senator Harradine will come into the chamber and answer them. In considering this package of measures, if Senator Harradine was to obtain consideration for his support for the legislation, why was consideration not given, for example, to a proposal that the government legislate to make Bass Strait part of the national highway system? A delegation was in Canberra today, I believeâbecause of my duties I was unable to be involved in any way in its proposalâseeking the support of the federal government for making Bass Strait part of the national highway system. What could be a more enduring job creation system for Tasmania, strengthening its tourism potential and giving benefits to members of the Australian public from mainland Australia to come to Tasmania and benefits for Tas 
 manians to leave the state, temporarily or permanently, by sea highway at no more cost than the cost of driving on the national highway system from one state to another in the rest of Australia? What could have been more valuable than that?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âWe have got that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âSenator Abetz suggests that we have that.

It is the passage of passengers across Bass Strait by sea transport which places Tasmanians and Tasmania at a disadvantage. I guess I am wondering out loud why that was not considered rather than some of the issues that have been considered, needed though they might be. It is a question of priorities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It was suggested in the debate that in lieu of some of these measuresâmeasures which might have a real life of only about five yearsâit would have been more beneficial for Senator Harradine to have picked up Labor's proposal from the last election, which I believe had the endorsement of the Tasmanian people, that the whole of Tasmania be a local call area zone. That would have meant significant savings to business and consumers in Tasmania, and it would not have run out in five years, because the use of the telephone system will certainly continue. It has been estimated that that would make an ongoing saving of $25 million per year for business and the public generally in Tasmania.</para><para>I am really asking the rhetorical questions of Senator Harradine, and he may take the opportunity to come in here and talk about whether those matters were considered by him or, if they were not, why they were not. I really do have the concern that, whilst some of these issues appear to have merit at the moment, they may well be issues which do 
 not have the life that some other measures might have had. I do suggest that perhaps getting a benefit for the state of Tasmania of the nature of either of those two initiatives would have been of more value and less likely to draw the criticism that there has been around the country of the deal that Senator Harradine has made with the government. Senator Harradine has no doubt done what he thinks is right. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6009</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.08 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>6009</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>6009</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics ActâProposal No. 7 of 1999.</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâDirectiveâPartâ</para><para>105, dated 11 [6], 19, 21 [3], 24 [2], 25 [8] and 31 [3] May 1999;

Although the work under the original contract with Worthington Di Marzio Pty Ltd had been completed at that date, the department was negotiating 
 a contract variation for further work. This has now commenced.</para><para>(2) The information provided under the contracts is both qualitative and quantitative.</para><para>(3) The contract with Wallis Consulting Group Pty Ltd relates to freedom of association.</para><para>The contract with Worthington Di Marzio Pty Ltd is to provide research to assist with strategic input and effective evaluation of the communications campaign about reforms to the employment services market.</para><para>The contract with ARSP is to obtain information on the drivers behind public attitudes to further workplace reform. The project is based on VISTA values research methodology, ARSP being the sole Australian supplier of this methodology.</para><para>(4) Two surveys are being conducted by Wallis Consulting Group Pty Ltd:</para><para>*	 a survey of approximately 1000 employers conducted by telephone and mail questionnaire; and</para><para>*	 a survey of 1000 union members conducted by telephone.</para><para>The employer survey is in the form of a self-completed mail survey returned by mail or fax. Prior to the surveys being mailed out to approximately 1000 employers, telephone interviewers called a sample of business establishments (1600 employers) selected at random from the Yellow pages and Dun and Bradstreet's commercial listing to establish the most appropriate person in the company to respond to the survey. Establishments were chosen to fit industry and size criteria (ANZSIC industry codes excluding agriculture, forestry and fishing; 400 small establishments, 300 medium establishments and 300 large establishments). Companies employing one or two people only at a site were excluded from the study.</para><para>The union member survey was conducted by telephone with employees at their homes and was run at the same time as the employer survey. The telephone survey method was selected in this instance because postal questionnaires may present difficulties for some employees in relation to literacy and understanding of questions (eg employees who are less educated or for whom English is not their first language).</para><para>Polling methods used by Worthington Di Marzio Pty Ltd were focus group discussions, executive depth interviews and telephone interviews.</para><para>The ARSP project consists of four stages involving a preliminary focus group phase; in-depth interviewing research; conduct of a survey and benchmarking of findings; and follow-up. The first two stages use qualitative methods and the third and fourth use quantitative methods. The third and fourth stages are optional.

No individual sub-contractors are specified in the contract with ARSP. However, the contract notes that ARSP may sub-contract fieldwork to companies which are members of either Interviewer Quality Control (IQCA) or the Association of Marketing Research Organisations (AMRO).</para><para>(7) The contract with Wallis Consulting Group Pty Ltd was let through an open tender process</para><para>The original contract with Worthington Di Marzio Pty Ltd was let through a selective tender process with the names of suitable polling organisations supplied by the former Office of Government Information and Advertising (OGIA).</para><para>The contract with ARSP was let through a staged procurement process. The department, on behalf of the Labour Ministers' Council, has established a panel of researchers who are available to undertake workplace relations related research projects including market research. The panel was formed through an open national advertisement. Thirty-four researchers submitted proposals to be part of the panel, including ARSP.</para><para>(8) Yes. (a) As described above, the EA has a contract with the Wallis Consulting Group, Melbourne for the purposes described in the answer to part (3) of the question. (b) The services provided are the conduct of two surveys [outlined in answer (4)] and analysis of data to be supplied in report form to the EA.
