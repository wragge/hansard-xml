This is the government's big tax adventure for Australia. This is the GST, and this is the bonus for older Australians provision in 
 order to compensate older Australiansâand, in particular, self-funded retireesâagainst the ravages of a GST. The government comes in here and moves an amendment and expects that, without any explanation, the thing will be passed. I do not think that is a reasonable expectation of this chamber. I have a number of questions and perhaps I should ask the first one nowâwhich the minister might wish to take note of and which, since she seems to be now prepared to make an explanation to the chamber about her amendments, she might wish to address in the course of that explanation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Prior to the deal between the Australian Democrats and the government to foist a GST on Australia, the Prime Minister is on record as having made an offer to Senator Harradine to induce him to, among other things, support the legislation. Would the minister be prepared now to inform the chamber what the terms of that offer were with respect to self-funded retirees and also how the terms of that offer meet what is now before us for consideration? Do they meet it wholly, or has there been a change during the course of the negotiations between the government and the Australian Democrats? If so, what is that change?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>6563</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPerhaps it might help the Senate if I give some explanation at this point. These amendments and requests are a direct result of the submissions to the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System and arise out of the evidence which was given. I might point out that the committee received around a dozen submissions from self-funded retirees and organisations, not just from individuals, and also from retrenched workers, who argued that it was unfair that they were forced to live on their savings but were denied access to the self-funded retirees bonus.</para></talk.start><para>This bonus is an important part of the compensation package. Because the savings of self-funded retirees are finiteâthat is, they do not have any built-in increase due to CPI or inflationâthe outcome for them does not rise with the GST. This effectively means that the GST discounts the value of their savings and their future income stream. This is why 
 it is necessary to have a one-off bonus payment to offset this negative result.</para><para>However, the bonus in the government's original package was made available only to people over the pension age, at 65 for men and 61 for women. Thus, many self-funded retirees were denied access to that bonus. What the Democrats have been able to achieve is to decrease the age from 65 and 61 respectively so that many retrenched workers over the age of 55 who have been denied access to social security payments will receive the lump sum.</para><para>In the case of people who have voluntarily retired, it may be justifiable for them to be denied access to the bonus, but we were worried more about those who involuntarily left the work force. Beyond age 55, once a worker is retrenched from a job, it is extremely unlikely that they will ever work again; they will have to rely on their retrenchment pay to live in the future. As a result of the 1996 budget changes many of these retrenched workers over the age of 55 were denied access to social security payments because they received such a lump sum payment. Under the new tax system they would not have received any compensation, either as a bonus or because of substantial tax cuts or through social security payments. This was what those dozen or more retrenched workers wrote to the Senate committee aboutâand we thought they had a good case. The amendment insisted on by the Democrats will move the eligible age for the self-funded bonus down to age 55 for genuine self-funded retireesâthat is, those without earned income or social security support. The cost of this is substantialâit will cost an additional $180 millionâbut it does ensure that one group that was not properly compensated is properly compensated now. I am pleased to commend this to the Senate as further evidence of the Democrats' determination to protect low income earners and the aged, in the new tax system.</para><para>I point out that, as far as pensioners are concerned, this bonus is on top of the pension supplement which we have also managed to secure. I also point out that, if the GST were to come in today rather than in July 2000, 
 that pension supplement would be $14.50 per fortnight for single pensioners. With inflation and other effects that will probably be more. For couples the supplement would be $24 combined additional pension per fortnight. This supplement is to be paid on top of the basic rate of pension for those pensioners who will receive it. We believe that the Senate should vote very strongly for this measure.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6564</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI put a question to the government, and the government has sat with its arms folded.

The truth is that they have voted for a GST to be imposed on Australia. You do not need to compensate for a GST if there isn't one. This package deals with compensation for self-funded retirees. The only reason this legislation is necessary is that we have a GST. The things we know about a GST are that inevitably the amount of tax risesâthe tax being proposed here is 10 per cent; no-one in Australia believes that it will remain constant at 10 per cent forever and a dayâand the other thing we know about a GST is that, wherever it has been applied, the bonuses or the compensation to offset the regressive impact of this flat tax erode over time. The two things we know about a GST are that the amount goes up and the compensation goes down over time.</para></talk.start><para>This is the question I asked the government. They put an offer to Senator Harradine: will they now outline to the chamber what that offer was, where it differs from the compromise agreement they have arrived at with the Australian Democrats, and will they say what that difference is? The government sits in this debate declining to answer those questions and declining to bring into this Senate chamber, for the information of all Australians, what their backroom dealing has been. On the basis of their absolute refusal to answer the question, it would be idle for me to conclude that they do not know the answer to it, since they are the authors of it, so the only conclusion open to me now is that the government do not wish to tell Australia what their proposal was and that, if they did, the proposal that they have now arrived at with the Australian Democrats would be seen for what it is: something less than what they were originally prepared to do. That is the only respectable conclusion able to be arrived at, because the conclusion of ignoranceâ`I didn't know'âis not one open to the government, who are the authors of this proposition.</para><para>So we go back the fundamentals of the GST. We know the amount rises and we know the compensation erodes. It seems to me that since the government are reluctant or refuse to tell us what their position is one ought to go on to the other part of the argument: is this adequate compensation for self-funded retirees or is it not? In this debate over the last week or two I have become sick and tired of the fact that every time I ask the government a question an Australian Democrat rises and gives the answer. When you turn to the government for an answer, they are locked up at the advisers box seeking more information, because they either do not knowâand when they get that information they sign off on the Democrat explanationâor sit pat, like they are now, declining to report to the chamber an answer to a reasonable question and a question that Australians are entitled to know the answer to.</para><para>In these circumstances I think it is fair to conclude that this package is unfair for self-funded retirees, who are people on fixed incomes and who are most at risk if taxes, 
 charges, prices or costs increase in the community. They are on fixed incomes. They are not in a position to negotiate a bigger income for themselves. They are not beneficiaries on the social welfare system. They have provided for their own retirement out of prudent investment or arrangement of their business affairs in such a way as to save themselves being beneficiaries and therefore they do not draw down on taxpayers' money. As a group of Australians in the community, they are entitled to due and proper compensation for an imposition of a new tax. No-one disagrees that the GST will impose higher costs.</para><para>Last week when we had this debate, indeed on Friday, the Australian Democrats made much of the fact that in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of the previous Saturday there was a published set of tables by Professor Harding and Professor Warren, who are regarded around Australia as being the experts on the distributional effects, that is to say, the equity effectsâare things fair?âin the distribution of the tax cuts and in the distribution of the compensation with respect to the GST; in other words, do the compensation and the tax cuts fairly offset the costs and charges that Australians will have to meet when they pay a new tax like a GST?</para><para>In that debate, I was referred to the Warren-Harding analysis. I was referred in that debate confidently, if I might say so, by the Australian Democrats on the basis that there would be no Australian losers. The comment was, `Go and look at the Warren-Harding tables. No Australian loses.' I have the Warren-Harding tables before me at the moment. This is the document that I was referred to. It was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of 19-20 Juneâthat is, the weekend before last. Under the headings `Single self-funded retiree' and `Self-funded retiree couple' it was stated that there are losers, there are people who will be worse off. So these compensatory provisions that we are debating now do not mean that no-one will be worse off. People will suffer. I remind the chamber again that these are people on fixed incomes. They are not people able to gain a higher income for themselves by negotiating new wages. They are people 
 who live off their investments; they have fixed incomes.</para><para>According to these tables, a couple of categories of self-funded retirees will be worse off. Importantly, when one looks at the categories of which self-funded retirees will be worse off, one sees that it is those self-funded retirees on lower incomes. These are not the wealthy millionaires able to live off their savings. These are Australians who have eked out investments for themselves. They have a modest income from their investments of between $10,000 and $20,000 a year but they are too proud to take a pension; they want to live off their investments. These are the ones that are worse off, the ones that are hit. These are the ones who cannot find extra income in their household budgets to compensate for the higher costs that they will be meant to be paying under a GST. It is no wonder, therefore, that at the beginning of this debate when I said to the government, `You have moved your amendments, but you haven't explained them to the chamber,' their approach was to sit pat. They declined to explain them. If they do try to explain them they will have to refer to the fact that if these amendments go through some Australians, among them self-funded retirees, will suffer. It is no wonder they are quiet and do not want to say anything. They do not want to draw attention to that fact.</para><para>I listened carefully to Senator Woodley's explanation. I am used to the routine now. You ask the government a question, a Democrat provides the answer and the government nods its head and does not say anything. Senator Woodley's argument did not go to the fact of whether people will be worse off or not. It went to the argument that the Australian Democrats have made it a bit better and not so many people will be worse off. It is not that everyone has had their position met and that no-one will suffer; fewer people will suffer. This is an argument that the Australian Democrats used to justify their compromise on the GST. But, like a compromise, it does not fix the problem: it fixes part of the problem.</para><para>I do not know why the Democrats are so lily-livered when it comes to negotiating with 
 this government. Given that the government requires their vote to get the bill through, why did they not exercise their negotiating clout properly in order to make sure that no-one will be injured by this measure? The fact that they tolerate injury means that they are not fair dinkum when it comes to all their professed self-belief about protecting those people in this community that cannot stand up and protect themselves. It means that they are not prepared to have a decent red-hot go when it comes to people who are at the bottom end of the income scale trying to survive off their own investment and who need legislative backup to ensure that they are properly compensated for the new cost of a tax.</para><para>Why do the Australian Democrats not do that? It is a worthwhile question to put to them. They had John Howard at the negotiating table. He required their vote to allow this legislation through. Why did they not hold firm and make sure that no-one suffered? Why did they allow some Australians to suffer? It is because they wanted a headline about how good they are as a serious political party. It is not a serious political party that reaches a compromise for the sake of public appearances but, when you look at the fine print, sells Australians down the river and makes them worse off.</para><para>I again say to the Australian government, `When you rise to justify your position, will you give us the benefit of making an explanation about your offer to Senator Harradine?' I am not at all certain that it will have the courage of its position to explain it to the chamber, since I have already invited it to do so and it has refused. This is a very important issue because an offer was made to Senator Harradine, although it was rejected. I must say that it was rejected on the very moral basis that it did not solve the problem: it went part-way to solving the problem but it did not fix it upâexactly the basis the Democrats have committed their vote on. Senator Harradine, as a moral person, declined to commit his vote, and because he did that the Prime Minister said to the Australian community, `I will legislate what I promised Senator Harradine by way of my offer. I will 
 put that in black-letter law.' Has the Prime Minister revealed the terms so we can test whether he is keeping his word by that commitment? No; we just have to take the Prime Minister on trust. Remember, this is the Prime Minister who said, `Never ever will there be a GST.' We have to take that person on trust that, although he is not revealing the contents of his offer to Senator Harradine, he is legislating for it.</para><para>But we know this piece of evidence as well: we know, from the lips of the Australian Democrats themselves, that not all the things that the Prime Minister promised Senator Harradine are being legislated in this package, that some of them have changed significantly or importantly and that some of them are being delivered at a lesser level than had been undertaken. Unless the government can actually prove, by now tabling the documents concerning what they offered Senator Harradine, that they are not here dudding self-funded retirees, we must assume that their silence means that they are not prepared to tell the truth and back up the Prime Minister by saying, `Here are the documents on what we promised. You can see for yourself that we are now delivering it.' If you have nothing to fear, why not come clean and give us the evidence? The fact that you sit silent and do not want to engage in this debate suggests that you have quite a lotâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>âSenator Cook, please address the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âI do address those remarks, Mr Temporary Chairman, through you to the Australian Democrats. I believe that this amendment does not go far enough and sells out self-funded retirees. The bonus for retirees goes nowhere near to compensating them for other items that they will have to pay a GST on and there are a number of items that they will have to pay a GST on for the first time. Self-funded retirees are often older people in need of the purchase of services that they themselves find difficulty in delivering. Many of them engage someone to mow their lawns or prune their gardens and require assistance with household maintenance, plumbing, electrical work and painting, 
 et cetera. They are not significantly capable of doing that themselves, so they engage outside help. They may have covered that in their original budgets, but one must remember now that they will have to pay an extra 10 per cent GST for the first time on all those services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is one of the reasons why this package does not go far enough to cover the cost of those extra charges that they will face. We also know from the Senate inquiry mentioned a moment ago by Senator Woodley that the Australian Investors Association, which gave evidence in Brisbane, gave evidence about what they regarded as the disastrous effect of a GST on retirees. I refer the Senate to the committee report for a full summary of that evidence. They wanted proper and full compensation in those circumstances. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered here. I will conclude my remarks because the light is on and I will have to sit down soon. We may not get the answers. The Australian Democrats and the government have imposed a guillotine on this debate so that if they do not answer the questions now, we will never get the answers because they are going to cut off this debate, stop our line of inquiry, and shut it down with a vote. They call that democracy! They ought to go and hang their heads in shame. These are serious questions about the welfare of Australians who have to face a new tax for the first time, but you are not properly compensating for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>6567</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am absolutely amazed to hear the Uriah Heep on the other side of the chamber wringing his hands over self-funded retirees. My memory is long enough, even if Senator Cook's is not, to just remember what the Australian Labor Party in government did to self-funded retirees. Let me start with probably the most heinous crime of all, that is, letting inflation rip in this country. That was a dreadful thing for people who are retired, an absolutely shocking thing, where the value of their assets and their savings simply disappearedâit left them high and dry 
 in very worrying circumstances. What did Labor ever do that was good for self-funded retirees?</para></talk.start><para>Yet this government is introducing substantial tax cuts for all Australians who have an income. This government is abolishing provisional tax, which is a great worry to older people and retirees generally. We have kept inflation low and provided the Commonwealth seniors health card for up to 220,000 more Australiansâself-funded retirees every one of them. The tax reforms introduced in the package of measures that are before the chamber mean that the 50 per cent taper rate for the old age pension being reduced to 40 per cent will lead to 50,000 more people being able to access a part pension, including a pensioner concession card. Those 50,000 people are currently all self-funded retirees. It is an incredible thing that we could observe that wringing of hands from Senator Cook on behalf of the Australian Labor Party when this government has done all those things that have helped self-funded retirees, with more to come under the legislation that is in front of us.</para><para>Do not forget the tax rebate treatment, which now means that self-funded retirees and pensioners are getting the same treatment there. I remember Labor being lobbied about that long and hard. The Association of Independent Retirees tried very hard for a number of years to get the Australian Labor Party to do something about that, but they sat on their hands. They did not sit on their hands entirely of course because they said that there were going to be l-a-w tax cuts. They introduced the legislation, they did not say that there would be any wholesale sales tax increases and they went to an election.

He was referring to Professor Harding and the use made by the Democrats of her findings on Friday, I think he was saying, with regard to what is going to happen to people under the amended package agreed with the Democrats. Senator Cook talked about some self-funded retirees remaining losers under the compromise tax package: a single person with $10,000 in private income and a couple with $20,000.

It reads:</para></talk.start></continue><para>But Professor Harding said these examples were unrealistic because these people should qualify for the pension unless they had expensive assets over and above the family home.</para><para>I was talking about wholesale sales tax when Senator Margetts called the point of order. That is very relevant to what is before us today because, when the wholesale sales tax 
 went up substantially after the 1993 election, with no prior warning and with no compensation at all, that hit all Australians. It inevitably must hit people on fixed incomes who are not in the workplace and who have little or no chance of increasing their savings when they want to buy replacement items for their home, for example.</para><para>Many older people, when they retire, want to make sure they can replace their fridge, which may have seen better daysâlike they often feel they have themselvesâor perhaps their TV is on the blink once too often and it costs them a lot in service charges. When a whole range of electrical goods need replacing after a lifetime, as they do, the increase in wholesale sales tax hits retirees very hard. By comparison, this tax package will mean the cost of the purchase of whitegoods and browngoods will be reduced substantially. That will help all Australians, but it will be particularly valuable for people who are in retirement and whose savings are finite.</para><para>These government amendments do relate to a supplementary bonus for self-funded retirees aged 55 and over on 1 July next year in the limited circumstances where the retiree has no more than a $1,000 business and/or salary income during the 1999-2000 tax year and has not received any income support payment during that year. That is an important factor in the whole consideration of tax reform. There will be extra costs on some items, for which the government and the Democrats agreement is providing additional compensation, but on a number of quite costly items there will be a reduction in price. Those reductions will be in an area that is very important to older Australians.</para><para>We continue to hear this same old chant from the ALP that the compensation will erode over time. I do not think it is necessary to go through that whole debate again. The ALP have run this line every chance they have had in this debate. It is not true. The compensation measures, as now completed in the drafting, will mean that the compensation remains indefinitely for people who need assistance through the pension or for people on low incomes. We are obviously just wiling away the time, as the ALP want to use up the 
 time between now and half past one. I daresay we are going to get simply more of the same. It is becoming very tedious, and I wonder whether they want to call it quits now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>6569</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just want to make a couple of points about this. People who are in retirement are overwhelmingly dissavers. They no longer continue to save money; they are actually running down their savings, for fairly obvious reasons. They are generally no longer employed or earning an income, and they are spending the money they have accrued throughout their working life. That is why a switch to a consumption tax, in this case a goods and services tax, has a particularly detrimental impact on people who are close to retirement or who are already retired. Because elderly Australians are overwhelmingly dissavers, it is difficult to disaggregate this and, I would argue, impossible to make any claim that elderly Australians are all better off and that there are no losers, as Senator Cook highlighted in the couple of examples that he gave the Senate earlier.</para></talk.start><para>What is interesting about the difference between the government's initial package and the requests that the Senate is considering is that the latter drops the age for the qualification of the self-funded retiree supplementary bonus down to 55. What is interesting about that is that it is, in part at least, attempting to compensate for another measure that this government introduced shortly after it came into office: the so-called deeming provisions, whereby persons who had reached the age of 55 had their superannuation deemed.</para><para>These particular requests that we have before us are in contrast to the deeming provision that this government introduced, which effectively forced people at the age of 55 to run down their savings and which, I might say, Labor fought hard and long against. It is a contradictory policy approach. To some extent you are attempting to give back moneys, having taken substantially more moneys off people who reached the age of 55.</para><para>My main concern with all this is how to guarantee that this inadequate compensation the Senate is considering for retired Austral 
 ians will be maintained forever. One of the great difficulties with a GST is that invariably the compensation payments madeânot just to retirees but to other people in society who are disadvantagedâdo not remain forever. We only have to look across the Tasman to New Zealand to see what occurred there. One of the requests we are considering in relation to A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Bill 1998  is a self-funded retiree bonus at age 55. In the explanatory memorandum that is costed at $150 million. I guarantee the SenateâI do not guarantee much to the Senate; politics is that sort of gameâthat, at some future date, the Department of Finance and Administration and the Treasury will be viewing this $150 million of expenditure with some considerable concern.</para><para>Like the government's activities shortly after it was elected when it introduced the deeming of superannuation at age 55, I am sure that Treasury and Finance would be eyeing off these compensation measures for future reduction in future budgets. I am sure that, at some future date when economic growth declines, as it inevitably will at some point, and there is a need to adjust budget expenditure, it will not be the higher income earners who gain very significantly from the income tax cuts that we will be considering after 1.30 p.m., who will be targeted for future budget cuts; it will be people who are retired, pensioners, self-funded retirees and lower income Australians. I am sure that these are the sorts of areas that will be targeted by this government in future budgets.</para><para>So I have two basic reasons: firstly, the inadequate compensation for people who have saved all their lives, and generally saved after they have paid tax. There is an interesting overall comment on a GST on people who are retired or close to retirement: they have been taxed on the way in and they are taxed on the way out. They are taxed on the way in because invariably much of their savings has been made from after-tax income earned during their working lives. Because they are dissaversâthey are running down their savingsâthey are particularly hard hit by an expenditure tax, in this case a goods and services tax. Secondly, there is the difficulty 
 you have in guaranteeingâlocking inâthese sorts of compensation measures forever. It would need to be forever. It is not just persons who are close to retirement or currently retired whom we need to be concerned about. It is people who are in their 40s at the moment and who have saved considerable sums. I would be very doubtful that these sorts of measures will be in place for people who are currently in their 40s and intend retiring in 15 or 20 years time.</para><para>I, like my colleague Senator Cook, am extremely concerned at the very poor outcome that the Democrats have reached on this issue. Firstly, it is next to impossible to compensate older Australians for a consumption tax. Secondly, it is certainly impossible to guarantee that these inadequate compensation measures that they have negotiated with the government will remain locked in forever. I issue a word of warning to the Democrats. We do not need to warn the government because we know what their approach will be in a few years timeâroll back these compensation measures for the elderly. That will be their approach. I warn the Democrats that, at some future date, the pressure will come on, whether they have the balance of power or not, to roll back these sorts of compensation measures. That is certainly one of my underlying concerns with the approach that has been taken by the Australian Democrats, and the very poor outcome that they have negotiated for retired people or people who are close to retirement in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>6570</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a question that relates to my earlier point of order. We are dealing here with the <inline ref="r663">A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Bill 1998</inline>  and my question is, first of all: is Senator Newman the minister with carriage of the bill or in this instance is she sitting in for Senator Kemp? The reason I ask this is that earlier on in the debate Senator Cook asked a number of questions on issues relating to these amendments, but more importantly he asked Senator Newman whether she would briefly explain the amendments she herself moved. We have not heard either of those answers. So my question is: is Senator Newman the minister with carriage of 
 this bill? Even if she is not and is standing in for someone else, there should be some explanatory notes to go with the amendments that have been moved. I do not think it is unreasonable for the Senate to ask for a brief explanation of the amendments that are being moved.</para></talk.start><para>Considering we are dealing with a bill that is intimately linked with the whole package, I also ask leave to incorporate in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> six pages from <inline font-style="italic">Commentaries on the Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</inline> by Quick and Garran which specifically relate to section 55 of the Constitution.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The pages read as follows</inline>â</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">254. The Imposition of Taxation.</inline></para><para>During the debate on the financial sections 53 and 55, the meaning of the expression "the imposition of taxation" was discussed, and the question raised whether a law imposing taxation and also providing for its collection would be ultra vires of the Constitution. Doubts were suggested whether the restriction that tax bills should deal only with the imposition of taxation might not be read so as to exclude from tax bills the ordinary machinery clauses, providing for the assessment and valuation of property, the subject of taxation, and for the enforcement and collection of the tax.</para><para>Referring to this point, Sir Samuel Griffith wrote: "A more serious question is whether provisions regulating the collection of taxes should be allowed to form part of the same laws by which the amount of the tax is fixed. This point should be clearly settled and expressed." (Notes on the Draft Federal Constitution, 1897, p.9.) Mr. Isaacs understood this note to mean that "imposing taxation" does not include collection and machinery. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2049.) Mr. Barton was inclined to think that, according to the well-known principle that the grant of a power includes all the necessary means for its effective exercise, the exclusive power given to the House of Representatives to originate bills "imposing taxation" would carry with it the subsidiary power to provide machinery in the same Bill for the collection of the taxes. It was pointed out that according to the practice observed in some constitutionally governed countries, taxing bills, fixing the nature, amount, and incidence of proposed taxes, were kept separate and distinct from machinery bills, dealing with such details as collection, assessment, and valuation. "Would not the power of collection be embraced in the power to impose taxation?" asked Sir Edward Braddon. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2056.) Mr. Barton said that power to collect would be, ordinarily, included in 
 the power to impose taxation, but in a section such as this, so strong in its intention to restrict laws imposing taxation to the mere imposition of taxation, it might be as well to remove doubt by adding after "imposition" the words "and collection." It was pointed out, however, that as the Senate was prohibited from amending proposed laws imposing taxation, the addition of the words "and collection" would have the effect of depriving the Senate of the power to amend matters in a tax Bill, relating to its method of collection.</para><para>"I confess that when I first proposed the amendment I did not see the extent to which it went. But, having appreciated the extent to which it goes, I still feel bound to adhere to it. The difficulty that would arise unless you allowed the House of Representatives to include in these Bills the ordinary powers of assessment and collection would be, that, while you might have a certain tax imposed in the Bill fixing the amount of the tax, the machinery Bill might be so subject to amendment by the Senate that the whole financial policy of the Government which introduced it, with a majority of the House of Representatives behind them, might be entirely subverted. That is a difficulty which, I think, none of us wish to create. Therefore, I am prepared to take the responsibility of adhering to the amendment. Holding the position I have always held, that the Senate should be a real body and not a mockery of State interestsâwhile it should be a Second Chamber holding definite powers and rights as expressing the will of the people within the States which it representsâI have also held that we should only carry responsible Government into effect by making it real and effective, and a power of amending a machinery Bill to the extent of making a tax not worth collecting would be equal to the power of amending a Bill imposing taxation." (Mr. E. Barton, Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2060.)</para><para>"All I am endeavouring to do is to attribute a meaning to words in this Constitution, which I believed in Adelaideâand I explained my belief as I have readâthat they did convey, which I am inclined to believe now they do convey, without a special explanation; but as to which I am in serious doubt, because of the very strong express nature of the words `shall deal with the imposition of taxation only.' It is in order to remove that doubt, and for that purpose only, that I wish these words to be inserted, and I really do believe that the insertion of the words will carry out the real spirit of the understanding of 1891." (Id. p. 2067.)</para><para>Mr. Barton's amendment to add the words "and collection" was rejected by 26 votes to 16. But see Note, 248, supra.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">255. "Shall be of No Effect."</inline></para><para>The next important point discussed was whether a law violating the rule forbidding the combination of taxation with any other matter, or the rule 
 forbidding a tax Act to contain more than one subject of taxation, should be void in toto, or should be void only to the extent of the irrelevancy, or to the extent of the additional subjects. Mr. G. H. Reid moved that the prohibition should not invalidate any part of the law which did not infringe the provisions of the Constitution, and that if any law imposing taxation contained more than one subject of taxation, the tax first in order of enactment should be taken to be properly passed. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2089.) This amendment was negatived by 27 to 15 votes. The feeling, however, prevailed in the Convention that some provision should be made in the Constitution, to the effect that only the parts of the Act in which the forbidden matter existed should be invalid. At a later stage Mr. Reid moved the insertion of the words "and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect." This amendment was accepted without a division. (Conv. Deb., Melb., 2415.)</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">256. "One Subject of Taxation Only."</inline></para><para>By the first paragraph of the section, laws imposing taxation must deal only with the imposition of taxation. If the section contained no other limitation regulating and restricting the exercising of the taxing power there would be nothing to prevent the House of Representatives from sending to the Senate a bill containing a number of separate and independent taxes. The section, however, goes on to enact that laws imposing taxation shall, with the exception of those relating to customs and excise, deal with one subject of taxation only. It is necessary to explain the object of this limitation. By the second paragraph of sec. 53, the Senate is deprived of the power to amend tax bills, but it may constitutionally reject them. In order to maintain its right to veto, in detail, each specific tax to which it objects, without thereby involving the rejection of other taxes of which it approved, the Constitution prohibits the combination of taxation proposals; it requires each proposed tax to be submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate, in a separate bill. This procedure being followed, the Senate can exercise its discretion with respect to each tax, without being coerced to pass a tax to which it objects, in order to carry a tax which it desires. In this respect the Senate will have greater control over taxation than the House of Lords enjoys.</para><para>The Papers Duties Precedent may be here referred to in illustration of the manner in which sec. 55 will operate in strengthening the Senate. In 1860, the Commons determined to balance the year's ways and means by an increase of the property tax and stamp duties, and the repeal of the duties on paper. The increased taxation had already received the assent of Parliament, when the Lords rejected the Paper Duties Repeal Bill, and thus 
 overruled the financial arrangements voted by the Commons. That House was naturally sensitive to this encroachment upon its privileges; but the Lords had exercised a legal right, and their vote was irrevocable during that session. The Commons, therefore, to maintain their privileges, recorded upon their journal, 6th July, resolutions affirming that the right of granting aids and supplies to the Crown is in the Commons alone; that the power of the Lords to reject bills relating to taxation "is justly regarded by this House with peculiar jealousy, as affecting the right of the Commons to grant the Supplies, and to provide the ways and means for the service of the year; and that to guard, for the future, against an undue exercise of that power by the Lords, and to secure to the Commons their rightful control over taxation and supply, this House has in its own hands the power so to impose and remit taxes, and to frame bills of supply, that the right of the Commons as to the matter, manner, measure, and time may be maintained inviolate." In accordance with these resolutions, during the next session, the financial scheme of the year was presented to the Lords for acceptance or rejection as a whole. The Commons again resolved that the paper duties should be repealed; but, instead of seeking the concurrence of the Lords to a separate bill for that purpose, they included in one bill the repeal of those duties with the property tax, the tea and sugar duties, and other ways and means for the service of the year; and this bill the Lords were constrained to accept. The budget of each year has since that occasion been comprised in a general and composite Actâa proceeding supported by precedent. In 1787, Mr. Pitt's entire budget was comprised in a single bill; and during many subsequent years great varieties of taxes were imposed and continued in the same Acts. (May's Parl. Prac. 10th ed. pp. 550-1.)</para><para>From this precedent it appears that the Commons have the right to send to the Lords a single scheme of taxation embodying the repeal of old taxes and the imposition of new taxes; the functions of the Lords being, in such a case, limited to a simple assent to the whole scheme or a simple negative of the whole scheme. Such a composite or general tax bill could not be submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate; it would be unconstitutional, the maxim being "one tax one bill," except in the case of bills dealing with customs and excise.</para><para>We have now to consider what will be the consequence if Parliament should, whether by accident or design, pass a law imposing taxation, yet dealing with more than one subject of taxationâa law, say, imposing an income tax and a stamp duty. A proposal that the tax standing first in order in the enactment should be valid, whilst the other, or others, next in order should be null and void, was rejected by the Convention. No provision is made in the Constitution, therefore, for 
 segregating the taxes and providing for the validity of one and the nullity of the others. Where the Constitution intends that one portion of an Act only shall be of no effect and the rest operative it is so expressed. The only conclusion is that an Act embodying a plurality of taxes would be absolutely and completely ultra vires.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>âI thank the Senate.

In considering these matters, you do have to have regard to what a future government would do. In that respect you have to have an eye on what a future Labor government would do. With that regard, past actions do indicate possible future attitudes as well as present actions. We do know, as the minister has pointed out, that in 1993 when Labor introduced the wholesale sales tax changes they did not provide compensation because they do not believe in providing compensation for regressive indirect taxes such as the wholesale sales tax. They also at that time affected self-funded retirees by taxing deemed capital gains. They did not compensate for that either. They also introduced an excessively high provisional tax and did not compensate for that either. My guess would be that, if the Labor Party vote against any of the compensation bills which are within this package, that will be a signal as to their likely attitude to whether or not they would seek to withdraw compensationâor, to use their words, roll back the packageâwhen they perhaps come into power at the next election. I think there is a warning there for us all.</para></talk.start><para>They have already, as we know, indicated that they believe food should be taxed.

Senator Cook drew attention to the Warren-Harding modelling. The minister quite rightly responded with the very clear qualification they put on that particular instance. The point is that, if self-funded retirees own their own home and do not smoke and if the real appreciation effect is taken into account, they will be $2.38 a week better off. Do I wish that they would be even better off? Of course. Everybody would like everybody to be better off. But that is as far as you can go with these things. When we look at the Access Economics modelling, we notice that their modelling did not take into account the franking credits adjustment. That is about $550 million which will be of benefit to this group of people. That was not modelled in there. Unfortunately, I am not able to do that arithmetically, but if that is taken into account their position improves even more.</para><para>I simply say in response to all this that not only have the Democrats attempted to ensure with the government that this category of persons is properly compensated in view of the introduction of the GST, despite the taking away of the WST, but also we have attempted to put them in the position where in real terms they are better off. I appreciate that that is modest, it is not a vast sum of 
 money, but nevertheless our calculations and our assessment of the matter are that they will be better offâunless, of course, a future government were to roll back compensation and to tax food.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>6573</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to conclude my remarks in ample time for the minister to have at least a third opportunity to answer the questions that I have put.

We are the authority on what we will do in officeânot the Australian Democrats who have a vested interest in painting us black in this debate. We have said that once a GST is introduced it is almost impossible to remove it. No-one really argues that point. Think about the number of state taxes and charges that would be removed.

Kim Beazley has said that we will work at trying to do the best we can. The governing rule that we apply in this debate about taxation is that Australians should be treated fairly. It is a bit rude to argue that a future Labor government may withdraw compensation. That is not our position at all; we have never said that. We are not committed to do that, and nor would we beâbut it takes the heat off focusing on the issue before us now.</para><para>The issue before us now is that, despite the compensation, a number of Australians will be worse off. That is the issue before us now. You said that no-one will be worse off. That is not true. The minister might try to explain

I draw attention to the evidence of Mr Bricknell on behalf of self-funded retirees before the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System. He said that many of these people do not draw the pension but live off their savings.</para><para>Let me now conclude, because I want to allow time for the minister to answer the questions I have put. The guillotine voted on by the Democrats and the government to kill this debate will descend in five minutes, so the minister will have one last shot to answer the questions about what the Prime Minister offered Senator Harradine so we can see whether we have the same deal here. Before I exit the stage, let the last word be from a self-funded retiree, as these are the people we are devoting our attention to at this stage of the debate.</para><para>In the edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> in which the tables that I referred to were published, there were a number of vignettes or snapshots of how people will be affected and what they think about it. Above the heading `Retiree', there is a photograph of a woman called Kate Arnold. It says that she is 70, is divorced and lives in Canberra. Her income is $22,000 from superannuation and a small British pension. She has a daughter aged 39. She pays no rent or mortgage and her only government payment is a health concession card. She spends about 80 per cent of her income. It is alleged under the tables of the economic modellers that she will be $41.04 ahead. What does she think about that? Let me quote what Matthew Spencer reported she said:</para><para>KATE Arnold has been around too long, she says, to accept economic modelling suggesting she will be $41.04 a week better off under the new tax package.</para><para>"I don't believe it," Ms Arnold says.</para><para>"It's tenuous as far as I'm concerned. Economic projections are very questionableâthey're like statistics.</para><para>"Nothing is going to compensate for the increase in service charges to start with."</para><para>The article then goes on to describe her circumstances. The last paragraph says:</para><para>However, Ms Arnold still believes the GST will fall unfairly on low-income women, particularly as there are more older women in the community.</para><para>Let the last word in this debate be from someone affected by it. Her income is within the range in the tables which shows people who will be worse off. She does not believe the modellers who make assumptions that if you do not have to pay for housing or if you do not buy cigarettes you will be better off. She does not believe the assumption that inflation will be 1.9 when, in fact, we know it will be 2.3 in the first year. She does not believe a number of the other assumptionsâblithely made by economists for a nice modelâwhich do not hold true to what people experience in real life as they struggle with their household budgets.</para><para>Kate Arnold does not believe that the cost savings will be passed on in their entirety and that no-one will bother to appropriate some of the cost savings to their profit and pocket it themselves rather than give it to the consumers. She does not believe any of that because she has come up through the world of hard knocks. She knows what happens in real life. Life does not conform to an economic model. It conforms to a whole series of imperfect applications of cost where people are trying to maximise their profits. She knows that. She also knows that the assumption of compliance costsâwhich we now know is $1.9 billion for small businessâwill be passed on. That was not included in the model either. She knows a lot of those practical, real life things. It is her last word that the Senate should have regard to.</para><para>We will support the compensation because the government is going to make sure that at this level it is done and it is not provided anymore. We will vote for this in order that someone can get something out of it, but that is not the ideal outcomeânot by a long stretch. I will stop here.

As I have gone around the country, I have found that, even where the ALP has managed to frighten older people about tax reform, those people have still constantly said to me, `Look, I'm not sure what it will do for me, but I know it will be good for my country and it will be good for my kids and my grandkids.'

Madam President, there is no doubt that those who have any degree of interest at all in this debate would be absolutely horrified at the proposal floated over the weekend by Mr Crean. Of course, he is 
 jumping on the bandwagon of Mr Tanner, who thinks that somehow you can break it up before you flog it. But that is not the way to go, and never has been. It was the preferred approach of Mr Keating, who wanted to hive-off mobiles, directory assistance, OTC and basically anything else.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course, we discovered later on from the George Campbells of this world that that was really the union model. The union took the view that the techs were the ones you had to look after: they are the ones who pay the union fees and who get you into the Senate, and therefore you keep them happy by keeping government ownership of particular core aspects of the network. The only problem with that, as Col Cooper eloquently pointed out the other day, is that that model was ridiculed 20 years ago because you simply do not know where to draw the boundary. You have increasingly intelligent functionality built into the backbone network, and no-one in this day and age is able to say where the network finishes and where the services hanging off the network ought to begin.</para><para>Of course, there are some very important questions that need to be answered by all those who believe they are serious about the policy debate. I see that Mr Della Bosca thinks he is serious. He, we now discover, was always against Labor running on tax. That is a very big revelation to me. I thought this mob were down on their hands and knees praying for tax to be the only issue in the last election, because they thought they would cream us. Do you know what his extra advice was? That he regretted the fact that they had not been positive; they were too negative.</para><para>I will tell you what: they could save a fortune on advertising this time around, because they will not have to spend a cent. They have not got any policy initiatives, nothing positive out there. The break-up of Telstra in no shape or form represents any sort of sensible policy solution. It is basically the sort of thing you do to fill in the long, cold hours in opposition. It might have been a very good idea if it was floated in the back room of the John Curtin Hotel, but it simply does not stand up to sensible policy analysis, and the Labor Party knows that. Mr Crean 
 knows it. They will not run with it, because they will get kicked to death by everyone with an interest in the subject.</para><para>Once again, it is just another way of filling in time, another way of proposing something which even the CEPU is violently opposed toâso heaven knows who is going to support them financially next time around. Mr Cooper said that this was `a technologically laughable thing to do' and signalled that the union would strongly oppose any ALP plan to break up Telstra. So don't you get yourself into shocking problems when you basically treat politics as a debating society, when you do not want to do the hard yards and when you think you can just trawl the gutter and spend endless hours trying to find little things here and there that you think might get you some passing glory, instead of concentrating on the real issues?</para><para>I read that Mr Stephen Smith thinks it is about time we had a review of Telstra policy, but basically his idea is to forget all about it, change the subject and talk about competition issues. We welcome that aspect of the debate, but it is little more than half the story.

Coming from Western Australia he no doubt has a very close interest in this matter. People smuggling is a growing problem worldwide. Countries such as Australia, the United States and Canada have all seen very substantial increases in the number of people attempting to enter illegally. Globally, the number is estimated to be around four million attempts each year. In addition to the problem growing, the nature of the problem is changing. It is now a sophisticated, organised criminal business worth at least $10 billion. In addition to the old wooden fishing vessels, we now have large steel-hulled 
 vessels with sophisticated radar, global positioning equipment and hidden compartments. These new challenges require a systematic and considered response. Yesterday's announcement by the Prime Minister was just that.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian government will spend an additional $124 million over four years to strengthen our capacity to detect and deter illegal arrivals. The initiatives include two additional Dash 8 aircraft to extend the footprint and intensity of Coastwatch's aerial surveillance, especially along eastern Australia, the apparent new favoured target; an additional night capable helicopter to be deployed in the Torres Strait; the establishment of a national surveillance centre at Coastwatch's Canberra headquarters, with electronic links to state government agencies and defence establishments; the creation of a new position, Director-General of Coastwatch, which will be filled by a senior officer of the Australian Defence Force. Liaison arrangements between Coastwatch, Defence and other agencies will also be strengthened. Twelve immigration officers will be posted overseas to major source and transit countries, including airport liaison officers at key airports. Bilateral agreements with source and transit countries will be concluded for cooperation on people smuggling issues and to provide for the return of illegal arrivals.</para><para>Australia will also give very strong support for the conclusion, as soon as possible, of a protocol on people smuggling in the proposed United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime. A high level committee chaired by the Office of National Assessments will also be established to coordinate information and intelligence on people smuggling. People smuggling, as with other crimes, is best targeted with intelligence at hand to focus one's resources appropriately. We will also introduce comprehensive legislative amendments to strengthen maritime investigatory and enforcement powers, and those provisions will be complemented by legislation that will strengthen penalties against people smuggling. There will be an opportunity soon for Labor and the Democrats to 
 support increased penalties in relation to this area.</para><para>The government has therefore taken a very comprehensive and holistic approach.

By the same token, we are certainly very committed to ensuring that the benefits of deregulation are fully appreciated. ABARE released its analysis of the potential impacts of deregulation on Australia's dairy farmers at Outlook `99 earlier this year and this analysis was based on its assumptions regarding the farm gate price of milk in a deregulated market. The government's understanding is that the analysis does not fully take account of the substantial commercial benefits that industry sees coming from deregulation. At the time the ABARE estimates were released, dairy industry leaders queried the ABARE assumptions, arguing that the impact of deregulation would be much less severe than ABARE estimates. Indeed, the Australian Dairy Industry Council, the peak industry organisation, claims that the current price premium on market milk will not decline by as much as ABARE assumes. They argue that dairy processors and manufacturers will still need to offer incentives to secure a continuous supply of milk throughout the year.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is fair to say that Senator Boswell is always out there ensuring that the best interests of people in rural areas are properly protected and I am sure that he will be an active participant in the debate.

Regrettably, a lot of that seems to be based 
 on the work of Dr Clive Hamilton of the Australia Institute. The government now has some new analysis done by Environment Australia and the Australian Greenhouse Office, drawing on work done by the Bureau of Transport Economics and ABARE. The research shows that Dr Hamilton's assumptions about the impact of the new tax system are wrong. Dr Hamilton has overstated the greenhouse implications of the original tax package and ignored the greenhouse savings impacts of the renewable energy and transport initiatives in the revised package. He also fails to take into account the additional greenhouse savings to be generated by the $100 million a year greenhouse abatement program that will run for four years.</para></talk.start><para>The new work confirms the positive environmental outcomes secured during the negotiations with the Democratsâdelivering benefits both in terms of air quality and greenhouse gas savings. This new analysis shows the revised tax package will deliver greenhouse gas savings of 5.5 megatonnes by 2010 compared with business as usual. It is significant that the analysis used to obtain this figure was put out for independent review by respected energy economist Dr David James. He has indicated that the estimated greenhouse emission savings almost certainly will be significantly greater than those stated. In simple terms, the deal secured with the Democrats will ensure that there is no detrimental impact on greenhouse gas emissions as a result of tax reform. In fact, there will be a net benefit in terms of greenhouse savings.</para><para>The news is just as good on air quality. The Bureau of Transport Economics estimates the revised tax package delivers a reduction of 40 per cent on business as usual projections for particle emissions from the transport sector by 2015. In fact, particle emission levels from the transport sector in 2015 are predicted to be below 1997 levels. This is because the package negotiated with the Democrats will deliver cleaner fuel and better engine technology.</para><para>So it is clear that the changes negotiated do deliver significant environmental benefits for air quality and greenhouse gas savings. It will give the Senate even greater confidence that 
 there will be no detrimental impact on the environment from the revised tax package. I am pleased to table the new research, the advice of Dr David James, and a brief covering note from the minister.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Heffernan, Senator Bill: Financial Interests</title><page.no>6585</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6585</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

I have been arguing for some time that ATSIC should put resources into family violence, and ATSIC has agreed to fund the $1 million program in the next financial year by taking $500,000 from its $11 million travel budget and another $500,000 from its $13 million public information expenditure.</para></talk.start><para>Family violence is a serious and distressing issue and I am pleased that key players like ATSIC and some states and territories recognise that we cannot ignore the problem.

There were 163 family violence deathsâmainly of womenâversus 126 deaths in custody. The federal government is taking a leading role in attempting to prevent family violence. Under the Prime Minister's strong leadership, we have committed $50 million over the past two budgets to the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence Program, which is focusing on the key areas of indigenous family violence, children at risk as witnesses, work with perpetrators and community education. I would also like to congratulate the Cape York Health Council on its new initiative to assist indigenous women and children experiencing family violence.

The Commonwealth is providing an extra $45 million over three years to the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program as a 
 result of the new tax package. That is on top of the $45 million announced in last month's federal budget.

Is the minister aware that, on 1 July, aged care residents in Tasmania and Victoria will not receive full indexation to their care subsidies? Can the minister confirm that this real cut in aged care funding in Victoria and Tasmania flows from the government's policy of coalescence? Why is the government continuing with this policy when the Productivity Commission inquiry that the government initiated recommended against it proceeding, finding that it would leave the quality of care as the balancing item in the funding arrangements? Why has the government refused to respond to the Productivity Commission's report, handed to the Treasurer on 13 January this year?

Contrary to the gratuitous abuse the minister provided in answer to the question, this is a very real issue.

It was an inquiry that the government initiated and that raised serious concerns in the community. What I want to know, Minister, and I appreciate you will take it on notice and give a proper answer, is why you have not responded to that report and why the government has not done anything to address the Productivity Commission's concern that the standard of care in Victoria and Tasmania will drop under your

I appreciate that the minister may not be feeling well today but I still do not think that there was an excuse to do that.</para><para>Just let me advise the Senate precisely what the analysis that <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline> have undertaken says. To restate this, essentially what they are saying is that the excise savings on 
 diesel will equate to a saving of only 0.33 of a cent in the dollar on food costs in rural and regional Australia. For example, if you buy a basket of groceries for $10, you receive a 3.3 per cent savingâand that is only if the transport operators actually do pass on the costs, and we saw the interchange between the minister and Senator Cook in relation to that. The figure is calculated on the fact that the diesel rebate will lower operating costs by 32 per cent. But only 21 per cent of a truck's operating costs relate to fuel and oil; 32 per cent of 21 per cent equals 6.5 per cent, which therefore equates to a retail saving to the consumer of 0.33 of a cent in the dollar. So that is how they derive their figures.</para><para>Interestingly, Senator Macdonald, in his response, essentially said, `It is the right way to goâreduce costs et cetera,' but what he failed to doâand I think it would be germane for the government to undertake thisâwas provide its modelling in relation to savings in rural and regional Australia and, in relation to the assertions made by the publication <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline>, prepare a refutation of those assertions. I would ask Senator Macdonald to take that on notice. If he would do so, that would be very useful. He has made no serious attemptâas has no government minister, including Senator Kempâto refute not simply these allegations but allegations that have been made previously. Nor has any government senator or minister made any serious attempt to table or provide information with regard to the government's own modelling in terms of the savings that it is asserting will occur.</para><para>Under the government's new legislation, which of course is the result of the deal with the Democrats, the reduced diesel excise will apply to all trucks of 20 tonnes and over and to trucks over 4.5 tonnes which operate in rural and regional Australia. Accordingly, some 60,000 petrol-powered trucks over 4.5 tonnes will receive no benefit whatsoever. Some legal authoritiesâand we heard the question earlier todayâbelieve that the inequality of treatment could raise questions about breaches of section 92 of the Constitution, and that has had quite a lot of airplay recently. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>âWho wrote this for you, Sue?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âI did. This legislation is a compliance nightmare, and it has had a lot of air coverage in relation to the potential abuse that this scheme will come under. The reason it is a nightmare is that businesses have the capacity to simply change their base of operations so they are located on the regional side of what is an arbitrary boundary line by altering their delivery patterns to obtain the maximum benefits from the scheme. What is the government's response to this? They simply announced huge fines. They say it will not happen because there will be huge fines if people do transgress the arbitrary boundaries which have been determined.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is obviously going to result in distortions of market patterns. This is obviously going to result in disparities in relation to rural and regional Australia, and it is obviously not going to get what the government wants, which are reduced costs in terms of transport and, therefore, consequential costs in terms of food. I think it is incumbent upon the government to answer a serious question from the opposition as to whether the allegations are correct and as to whether the issues that have been brought to bear by a number of organisations in terms of the potential breaches are correct. I do not think it is reasonable for the government to simply say, `We won't give you the modelling,' or, more likely, `We haven't done the modelling.' If there was modelling doneâif the savings can be realisedâwe want to see the figures. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>6592</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf ever there was anyone on a hiding to nothing, it is Senator Mackay.

 massive reduction in the cost of fuelâfor those qualifying trucks. Those trucks are, of course, trucks that have a total weight in excess of 4Â½ tonnes operating in rural and regional areas of Australia and those trucks with a total weight in excess of 20 tonnes operating anywhere in Australia, whether that be rural and regional areas or the metropolitan areas.

What we need to remember is that this is what the transport industry itself sought in their discussions with the government when we were developing our tax package over the last year or two.

This government, in contrast, has reversed that and is actually doing something to reduce the cost of transport in this country.</para><para>Australia is an enormous country geographically and it has a relatively small population concentrated in particular areas. Therefore, transport is a very important factor in Australia, and the cost of transport makes up a much bigger proportion of the cost of production in Australia than it does in other countries. Therefore, to get rid of the taxes on transport is a very important initiative in reducing the cost of transport and ultimately reducing the cost of the goods that require transport from their place of manufacture to their place of market, whether it is within Australia or, very importantly, from the places of production in Australia to the ports for export to earn more export dollars for Australia.

You know that all too well. What I am once again drawing attention to is that, when this new Democrats-government GST package came before the chamber, we asked the government and the Democrats to make a statement as to the significance of their changes, to save us having a statement made each time, and they declined to do so. So we are debating blind, without the proper information before us, in an effortâon a joint guillotineâto rush this legislation through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I make this pointâand let me mark the spot in making itâthat, if there are therefore errors in this legislation which proper debate would have otherwise detected, then the fault is the government's and the Democrats'. When people in the Australian community have the obligation of dealing with these laws that we are so quickly rushing through this Senate, the fault will be entirely that of the government and the Democrats, and there will 
 not be acceptable in public debate any argument from the government or the Democrats that somehow or other it is Labor's fault. Let it be known now. Let the spot be marked right now, that the fault is the government's and the Democrats' as far as the errors go that will surface in this legislation.</para><para>The first and most important of all of this legislation that we have to consider is that embodying tax cuts. The tax cuts are large cuts. I think, though, that there is an issue here of fairness and equity considerations in the manner in which these tax cuts are given. Let me make one point before I turn to some of the inequities that are apparent on the schedule, once you look at where the tax cuts fall and who gets the benefit of them.</para><para>The first point is this. We are introducing a new tax, a GSTâsomething that Labor opposes but that the Democrats and the government want. That will impose extra costs on the Australian community. As a way of offsetting the extra costs on ordinary Australian citizens, the government is providing, by way of compensation, cuts to the taxation scales. They will market those cuts as being a handout from the government to the community but, whenever they do speak about that, one should remember that this is compensation for a new taxâa new tax on everything, a new tax in the form of a GST which, if you look at the historical record, is a tax which always increases over time and never decreases.</para><para>So these compensations, to the extent that they are real, are to compensate for a tax which will rise over time. That is always what happens with a GST. But the compensation will remain fixed. Worse than that, the compensation will erode, because we do know that bracket creep, or the workings of inflation on wages, pushes wage and salary earners to higher incomes but not higher real money incomes and pushes them into different tax brackets so that, when they get pushed up the scale on bracket creep, they are obliged to pay higher taxes. The net effect is that the real value of their income erodes over time, unless you compensate for bracket creep in terms of your tax scales. Do these tax scales compensate for that? No, they do not.</para><para>So the two realities, the two grim reapers, of the GST are, firstly, the fact that it always increasesâthat is a historical record around the world wherever a GST has been introduced, and the elaborate mechanism to fool Australians into believing that it will not do so in Australia is of course a farce; it will increase here. And the second grim reality is that the tax cuts erode and therefore the compensation to offset for Australians the so-called higher costs and charges of a GST go down irretrievably as a consequence of the working of the taxation system. So when government spokespeople get up and say, `Look how munificent we are, how bountiful we are. Look at what we are giving to the Australian community,' one must remember always that the tax goes up and the compensation goes down, and that is a historical record.</para><para>Having made that point, I turn to the nature of some of these tax cuts. As I do so, I point out that we are going to vote for these tax cuts, because we do think Australians need relief now that this chamber has voted for a 10 per cent GST. We do think Australia needs some relief, and that is why we are going to vote for them. But we do not think that these tax cuts embody sufficient or appropriate relief. I go to two examples of what I mean in terms of equity. The personal income taxes that we are considering favour the rich and work against middle and low income Australians. Some examples from the tables published in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> the Saturday before last were worked out by the two pre-eminent economists in this field, Professor Warren and Professor Harding, and give the lie to the government claims about equity. I take two examples. A single income couple with one child, receiving $35,000 a year, receives a so-called total benefitâthat is, a total tax cutâof $17.80 per week. If that same family were to receive $70,000, not $35,000, it would get a total benefit of $77.19. So the family on the lower income gets $17; the family on the higher income gets $77.19. Of course, they are paying the same price for the goods and services they consume, because this is a flat tax. It charges people the same price, irrespective of their income. And it is irrespective of their income 
 on this basis: if you get 70 grand, you get $77; but if you get only 35 grand, you get only $17. And they say this is fair.</para><para>One can look at the gross figures. Gross money figures tell one sort of story. Let us look at it another way: in terms of percentages. A $17.80 tax cut as a percentage of $35,000âI have not done the sumsâis just over a five per cent share of the total amount. But on $70,000, $77 is just over 10 per cent. So if you get a higher income, you get a higher percentage as well as more money; if you get a lower income, you get a lower percentage, despite less money. And they say this is fair.</para><para>Remember this: the doyens of so-called fairness, the people who thump their chests and claim to be compassionateâand indeed the government has now adopted the Texas view of compassionate conservatism that George Bush Jr is campaigning on in the US primaries, a phrase coined in the United States and suddenly adopted in Australia; it does not mean anything and it has no substance to it but it has a nice ring on televisionâthe so-called compassionate conservatives of the government are saying that is fair.</para><para>But with respect to those who have raised themselves on the edifice of so-called fairness, the Australian Democrats, this is their package too. They reckon that it is fair. We all remember what they said when they went into negotiations with the government. What did they say? They said they would start to smooth out the inequities of the tax cuts. Did they? Well, they did a bit. But did they do it properly? Not at all. What they did was fiddle at the top end of the scaleâand we welcome those changes. Do they go to the level of real need in the community? No, they do not. It is a bit of window dressing to say, `Well, we changed the system.' What did they give as their explanation for not doing the job properly? `Mr Howard refused. Mr Howard did not agree.' The Australian Democrats have to take the responsibility for this. Mr Howard did not agree because they did not insist. This legislation will not pass this chamber unless they vote for it. They had the ideal negotiating position. They could have said, `I am sorry, Mr Howard. That is inequitable. That is 
 unfair. We will not vote for your package unless you restore some equity to the tax scales. Make it better than this.' Did they do that? They may have done, because it was behind closed doors, but John Howard stared them down and they bought the package at the end of the day, and therefore they own the inequities and unfairness in this package.</para><para>I give you another example: a dual income familyâtwo wage earners with one childâthat receives $35,000 a year gets tax cuts of $8.59 per week. Two income earners with one child on 35 grand per yearâthese are not people who earn a lot of money; these are people on the lower end of the income scale in Australiaâget an $8.59 per week tax cut. The same familyâa dual income family with one childâon $100,000 receives a weekly benefit of $75.56. So if you are poor, you get less. If you are getting $100,000 per year, you get more. In percentage terms again: the higher the income you get, the bigger the percentage of rebate you get; the lower the income you get, the lower the percentage. So not only in money terms but also in percentage terms this package is inequitable. And this is the embodiment of fairness and equity as far as the Australian Democrats and the national coalition led by John Howard are concerned, because this is what they are doing.</para><para>What has Mr Howard said about this? One of the things he has said which is most illuminating is that he is going for middle Australia and that he wants to reward effort. Well, middle Australia are entitled to some tax relief, because middle Australia are the ones that are pushed into higher income brackets by bracket creepâthe matter I spoke about earlier. But there is no excuse, when you go up these scales to $150,000 and $200,000 a year, for those people to still be getting big handouts when the poor at the other end of the scale are getting miserly handouts. Remember, as I said, that the tax goes up and the compensation erodes with time, so the first victims of the erosion with time effect of the compensation will be those at the bottom end of the scale. And they say this is fair.</para><para>I am one of those Australians who believe that a fair go for all is a basic right of all Australians. It is part of our folklore and what makes up our national character. Australians will say, `This is not fair.' While many of us at the higher levels of the income scales will benefit from this, and I will be one of themâI will benefit better than a lot of low income earnersâI still think it is not fair and that the rights of low income earners ought to be protected. Remember this: low income earners spend every cent they earn and they have nothing left over to save. So they have no capacity to find extra funds within their miserly household budgets. They are always stretching to try to meet the needs of the day, to accommodate extra costs.</para><para>What will this tax do? It will impose extra costs on these people. Why therefore do we need to have regard to the ability of welfare organisations to service the poor? In part it is because what this government-Democrats' package is doing is pushing them further down the trap into poverty. I say, `Okay, you have got away with a GST. This chamber has voted to impose one against the opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The very least you can do, if you have a bone of decency in your body, is to restore some equity to the income tax scales. Do not go chasing votes by trying to bribe people into supporting the GST, by giving the influential end of the income scales a higher handout so they will speak more proudly about a GST while ignoring the complaints at the lower end of the income scales.' This amounts to a vote bribe to support the GST by those at the wealthy end of the scale without regard to those at the other end of the scale.</para><para>As I said, there are some 22 bills that I have to debate now in less than three-quarters of an hour. We are considering the first one and I have not dealt with it comprehensively. The light is on; I will have to sit down shortly. There are a number of other bills which I think deserve a particular amount of attention. I hope that the government and the Democrats do not try to soak up the remaining minutes of this debate so that we cannot get our viewpoint across. I would hope that the next call goes to my colleague Senator Sherry so 
 he can deal with the inequities in the wine industry. I would hope that when Senator Conroy comes in here in a minute we can deal with the ACCC. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6601</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are just a couple of issues that I would like to point out to Senator Cook. Firstly, I go back to 1993. We touched on these issues before but, after what he has said today, he obviously was not listening. I remind him that when the Labor Party dealt with tax cutsâthey were the last ones to do soâback in 1993, they looked at the issue of bracket creep and did not give any tax cuts to those earning under $20,700. There was no immediate compensation of any description for pensioners. Indeed, pension changes were delayed for many months. From memory, they were delayed for about eight months.</para></talk.start><para>I say to Senator Cook: look again at what the Labor Party did and in particular look at the fact that the maximum tax cuts went to those earning over $50,000âin other words, a similar situation to the one we are considering now concerning bracket creep. I point out that it is a separate issue from compensation for the GST. As we deal with bracket creep, we need to look at those areas where people jump into the higher brackets, and that comes back to the same area that Labor dealt with. But at least this time we are also seeing considerable tax cuts for those earning under $20,700. This time it is a very different story. I will go into more detail in a moment, but I remind Senator Cook that this time those earning over $100,000, on average, will be paying more tax.</para><para>The amendments that we are considering now revise the tax scales that were in the original ANTS package. The Australian Democrats are very pleased with what we have achieved. We did not achieve everything we set out to achieve, but certainly we have seen changes above the $50,000, and now the top marginal rate cuts in at $60,000 rather than the original government proposal of $75,000. This measure will save us $1.3 billion. That will go towards the cost of taking food out of the GST which itself is a 
 very progressive move and benefits those on low incomes the most.</para><para>It is a very long time since we last revised our tax scalesâit goes back to 1993. Indeed, it will be seven years by the time these changes come into place. That is too long. Perhaps something we can put on the government's agenda is that we look at indexation so we do not have this battle every three, five, seven years or whatever of making the adjustments as people creep up the scales and get into higher and higher tax brackets, that we look at indexation and put to rest once and for all this ongoing battle of who gave which tax cuts to whom.</para><para>From 1993 to 2000, average earnings will have risen around 30 per cent; in other words, they will have gone up from $31,780 for a full-time adult to around $42,000 in the year 2000. That means that average income earners now face a marginal tax rate of 43 per cent. It is already one of the highest rates in the world so, given the fact that we are not indexing, again we will have this problem occurring down the line and it will have to be dealt with. Since 1993, as wage inflation has pushed up earnings, bracket creep has delivered a windfall to the government. That windfall is now in the order of $8 billion a year, or nearly 10 per cent of our total tax collections. Indeed, the entire budget surplus can be attributed to bracket creep. I think that is unacceptable. Clearly, tax reform in the form of revision of the income tax scales is overdue. We had argued, and still say to government, that it could have been done separately from the GST and then we would have seen more clearly the need for compensation as opposed to the need to deal with this second issue.</para><para>The bill in its amended form will deliver $12 billion of income tax cuts in the year 2000, which is bracket creep plus the other four. We are prepared to support this because, under the new tax system, two-thirds of the funding for these tax cuts comes from base broadeningâsomething the Labor Party did not do. Indeed, they used the rise in wholesale sales tax to pay entirely for their tax cuts. This time we are paying for some two-thirds of them by doing things like tightening up the 
 rules of the fringe benefits tax. That will see, again, $760 million going into the coffers in relation to social security measures.</para><para>An amount of $790 million will go into the coffers from taxing trusts as companies and $1.4 billion will be raised from business tax compliance measures. An amount of $2 billion will be raised from abolishing the savings rebate; $2.6 billion from new company tax payment arrangements; and $300 million from the deferred company tax payments and life insurers. So $7.7 billion is being paid for by those mostly at the top. They are the ones who are using a variety of arrangements for minimisingâlegally at the momentâthe amount of tax they are paying. So it hits high income earners the hardest. I cannot understand how Senator Cook does not seem to be able to understand this. The revised tax cuts will be skewed to benefit middle income earners, who have borne the brunt of bracket creep.</para><para>According to 1996-97 tax statistics, 88 per cent of taxpayers earn less than $50,000. They paid 60 per cent of the tax collected. They receive 67 per cent of the up-front tax cuts, but when other income tax measures are taken into account, they receive some 76 per cent of the net tax cuts. According to the 1996-97 tax statistics, 1.3 per cent of taxpayers earned over $100,000 per year and paid 12.4 per cent of tax. They receive just 4.3 per cent of the up-front tax cuts. But after the effects of all the tax measures are taken into account, taxpayers on over $100,000 a year, on average, will be paying more tax than they are now. Let me repeat that: when we put it all together and look at the base broadening and who that affectsâthe trusts and savings rebates; we roll all that in togetherâtaxpayers on more than $100,000 a year will be paying more tax than they are now. This is a direct result of the Democrats' insistence that tax cuts be pared back on incomes above $50,000.</para><para>The savings, as I said, are $1.3 billion and we left intact all the cuts for those at the bottom end of the system. The new top tax rate will cut in at $60,000, about 1.4 times average earnings. That compares with the last time that it was reviewed by Labor and set at 
 $50,000, which was then 1.8 times average earnings. The bottom rate for incomes below $20,000 will be cut from 20 per cent to 17 per centâthe lowest rate for more than three decades. That is half the rate it was in the 1970s and lower than it ever was under a Labor government, so I am pleased to support this amended tax scales bill. We end up with a progressive tax system where high income earners on average end up paying more tax, low income earners enjoy the lowest marginal rates in decades and middle income earners get relief from bracket creep. That is a very worthy outcome.</para><para>I have to say that I would like to see more action on closing tax loopholes. Some issues have now been referred to the Ralph inquiry and I am pleased to see the allowance of an extra month for that report to come down. As part of our agreement with the Prime Minister and the government, what has gone over to the Ralph review includes the alternative minimum company tax proposals. We have particularly asked them to look at the United States model to reduce corporate tax avoidance and also the use of company structures and contracts to reduce the tax paid by personal service workers. Those two issues have gone to Ralph. These issues, and the reduction of the concessional treatment of company cars already being considered by Ralph, could raise an additional $2 billion a year. They are fights that we will leave for another time. I commend these amendments to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>6603</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Madam Chair.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âMadam Chair, I jumped to my feet well before Senator Sherry.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âUnfortunately, I called Senator Sherry.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âI did jump to my feet.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âSo did I, and I beat you.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âMadam Chair, you have now called two Labor speakers on this bill.

I do not want to speak for the full 15 minutes, Senator Kemp. I will speak for about five minutes on the wine industry equalisation tax. I think it is a matter of great regret that, for this very important issue to one of Australia's fastest growing industries, we have got less than 35 minutes and it has not yet rated a mention in this debate. The Australian wine industry, as I think most people in Australia are aware, has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. It has become a world beater. It is a very important industry in the value adding of agricultural commodities: grapes. It is a top industry in the world in terms of quality. We now export $880 million of wine annually to more than 80 countries and the industry has an international reputation as an exporter of quality and premium wine at a competitive price.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think, unfortunately, that many in the wine industry believe that, with the government's proposals for a goods and services tax, the other taxes that apply on wineâthe excise taxes on alcohol generallyâwould either be abolished or at least be held at a level so that the price of alcohol would not go up once the GST is added. I believe that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Liberals blatantly misled the wine industry about the level of the new taxânot just the GST but the new wine equalisation tax which is being introduced. The Winemakers Federation and the wine industry generally believed that the new wine equalisation tax would be revenue neutral, but of course that is not the case. The Liberals and Mr Costello have continued to mislead the wine industry, although very reluctantly and only recently, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, 
 has conceded that the new wine equalisation tax will increase the industry's annual tax take by eight per cent.</para><para>The Winemakers Federation of Australia estimates that the new wine equalisation tax plus the GST will increase the wine industry's tax impost by $147 million a year. So the total tax take from the wine industry is going up significantly, about 12 per cent, according to Mr Sutton, Chief Executive Officer of the Winemakers Federation. He says that `this breaches an earlier government promise that the new tax system would have no significant effect on tax revenue'. This has caused grave concern in the wine industry for two basic reasons. First, the level of tax on wine in Australia is being increased significantly and Mr Sutton says:</para><para>. . . the government is pushing usâ</para><para>the wine industryâ</para><para>now into the rarefied position of being the most highly taxed wine growing country in the world and this is a massive increase in tax on one of Australia's most successful exporting industries.</para><para>This has drawn criticism. It is interesting to see that Senator Crane is not in the chamber. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  said:</para><para>Senator Winston Crane (Lib)â</para><para>from Western Australiaâ</para><para>who is also chair of the Government's agriculture committee, said the wine tax policy could be `better and fairer'. Senator Crane said the Government's package should be supported when it is voted on in the Senate, but he called for `independent research' to be undertaken to determine the actual impact on the wine industry.</para><para>We know what the impact is going to be: a massive increase in tax on the wine industry. Secondly, because of that increase and the structure of the existing tax on wine, which is ad valorem, this will mean a significantly greater increase in prices for the higher priced, higher quality wineânamely bottled wineâand a lower price increase for cask wine.</para><para>This has some important policy implications. I would like to use, as an exhibit for the Senate, a cask of wine.

When you look at the back of the box it says `product of Spain 95 per cent, Australia 5 per cent'. With the skewing of the wine tax to favour bulk wine, we are seeing significantly increased imports of bulk wine from overseas. That is one detrimental impact of this structure of the tax. The second issue relates to the health impact the sale of cheaper wine will have.</para><para>I want to reiterate that we are seeing an increase in the total wine tax, which is breaking the government's commitment. It is an extra $147 million. What is the Democrats' response? The Democrats claim they have a deal with the Howard government that will:</para><para>. . . ensure that the states keep arrangements which provide a tax exemption for cellar door and mail order sales up to $300,000.</para><para>That is the announcement by the Democrats. We would like an undertaking from the Democrats that that deal will be delivered, because apparently the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has left the wine industry floating in the wind, so to speak. The Treasurer has reiterated these arrangements. He says:</para><para>We will ensure that states will keep arrangements providing for rebates on cellar door and mail order sales for wineries up to $300,000.</para><para>But he then went on to say:</para><para>The states should be in a position to continue those rebate schemes.

I was actually trying to provide more time for Senator Cook, but as he chose to complain about it I will make a few remarks. The spleen which the Labor Party is showing is quite astonishing. This is a party without any policies, a party which has made no contribution to the tax debate and a party which has not raised any alternatives. It has come into the chamber and attempted to block a series of bills. It is worth recording, in the interests of the public, that the Labor Party is now complaining about the largest income tax cuts in Australian history. That is what the Labor Party is complaining about.</para></talk.start><para>If you look at Senator Cook's speech, you will see that the Labor Party is complaining that we are giving massive tax cuts. Despite what you say, Senator Cook, a fair assessment of the tax cuts that we are giving reveals that huge benefits flow to low and middle income earners. This is not just the assessment I am making; this is the assessment of independent observers. If you look at the modelling carried out by Warren and Harding or by Access Economics you will see that we are providing massive tax cuts to lower and middle income Australia.</para><para>Let me outline the scale of some of these tax cuts. There are two examples which are perhaps worth recording in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. This is the advice I have received. It relates to a single income family with two children 
 between five and 13 and an income of $30,000. That is not a high income; it is lower than average weekly earnings. Warren and Harding, independent modellers, I am advised, calculate that this family will end up with an extra $49 in its pocket every week. Senator Cook comes up and sneers at it. The Labor Party has never given a tax cut like that in Labor Party history. That is not the government arguing that case; that is the advice I have received on what Warren and Harding calculated.</para><para>Access, another independent modeller, estimated that the benefit to this family is $59 per week. This is an increase of over $3,000 per year after GST. These are not small derisory tax cuts; these are very substantial tax cuts which are giving very real benefits to people on low incomes. Let us look at a single income family with one child under five and an income of $30,000âless than average weekly earnings. Access, the independent modellers, calculate an extra $54 per week. That is a very substantial rise. Warren and Harding calculate an extra $44 per week. These are very substantial tax cuts. These are of great benefit to low and middle income Australia.</para><para>Senator, you stand up and attempt to mock those cuts when the Labor Party offered nothing. You know that the truth of the matter is that, when this bill goes through, the Labor Party will be revealed as a party without policy and direction and as a party whose whole policy strategy has come unstuck. Your attempt to block major tax reform will be exposed for what it is. The one reason for the spleen and sheer nastiness coming from Senator Cook in this debate in the chamber is the realisation that you have failed in the task which you set yourself. You failed in the last election and you have failed in your efforts to make this government break its promises at the last election. Senator Cook, the public will judge you and your colleagues harshly, I believe.</para><para>What did the Labor Party want to do in the last election? The Labor Party wanted to impose a capital gains tax on pre-1985 assets. That is essentially what your policy was. Of course, days after the election you junked that

What an astonishing thing. As Senator Boswell pointed out correctly, all I am trying to do is to indicate what the Labor Party policy is. Senator Cook knows what the answer is. Consider a family with, say, three children and both of the adults in the family earning $35,000 eachâa total family income of $70,000. Do you know what this family got from the Labor Party in tax cuts? Zero; absolutely nothing. That was your policy, Senator, and it is no wonder that you were beaten again at the election. Unless you improve your approach to politics, unless you are prepared to get in there and develop real policies, the public will judge you harshly again, as indeed they should.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Constant abuse of people and constant attacks on the integrity of people are not a substitute for real policy. Real policy requires a bit of work. Above all, it requires some knowledge of what you believe in. And the great problem for the Labor Party, as I have said often in this chamber, is that the hardest question you could ask them is: what do you 
 stand for? They do not know, and nobody else knows. Until you and your colleagues do some of the hard work and work out what you stand for and build on that and develop some real policies, Senator, I suggest that you will be over on that side of the chamber for a very long period indeed, and deservedly so.</para><para>Some issues regarding the wine equalisation tax were raised, so let me make some comments on that. The WET carries across the basic structure of the wholesale sales tax, so the practical change for taxpayers is minimal and generally improved. This will ensure that the principles underlying the WET are familiar and that the concepts underlying the legislation are well accepted by the industry. The WET will be integrated with the registration requirements for the Australian business number, the ABN, and this will be simpler and more consistent for business. The Commonwealth does not propose to rebate the WET on cellar door sales and samples, consistent with the existing practice where the Commonwealth provides no rebates under the wholesale sales tax.</para><para>The states and territories have maintained rebate schemes as part of the safety net arrangements introduced by the Commonwealth to replace business franchise fees that were of questionable constitutional validity. The states and territories receive goods and services tax revenue. After 1 July 2000 they will receive more revenue, including the funds that would have been raised by the safety net arrangements if they had continued to be in place.

I guess what we are being asked to believe is that this will make up for a lot of the damage that is going to be done to industry by this whole package. Senator Sherry brought up fervently the issue in relation to what is going to happen with 
 the whole package, and especially the volumetric tax on the wine industry. I would like to add something to that argument. In the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  newspaper on Thursday, 24 June 1999, the editorial said:</para></talk.start><para>The fundamental flaw in the proposed new tax is that it is to be based on value rather than volume or alcohol content.</para><para>It also says:</para><para>The National Small Wineries Coalition has pointed out that 97 per cent of the nation's wine is produced by 20 big corporations and the rest by more than 1000 small businesses. It says 64 per cent of the big corporations' sales in Australia are of cask wine.</para><para>It also says:</para><para>Apart from its financial inequity, the WET proposed is unacceptable on the ground of public health.</para><para>It goes on to say:</para><para>And if the Australian Democrats really cared for small business the party would have supported a volume-based system, rather than push for another confusing tax exemption.</para><para>I could not agree more. The Independent Winemakers Association said:</para><para>The Australian wine industry faces a choice. It can continue under a socially irresponsible tax regime which punishes the pursuit of quality and rewards instead the mass production and import of cheap alcohol; or it can urge government to adopt a more sensible system which taxes alcohol and promotes the quality improvement demanded by an ever more discerning world market.</para><para>The volumetric tax advocated by the Independent Winemakers Association has full support from all major welfare, medical and drug authorities in Australia. It is simple and practical, and it gives a better deal to virtually all Australian grape and wine producers.</para><para>They go on to say:</para><para>Political decisions made now will show whether the government is serious in its fight against drugs, and prepared to support the industry's development as a responsible and economically valuable producer of health-giving quality wines; or whether on the contrary it will continue to pursue socially retrogressive policies, condemning the industry to future mediocrity and entrenching it as a legitimate target for anti-alcohol lobbies in the years to come.</para><para>I was very encouraged by the words of Senator Sherry. I hope that means that the ALP are now moving in their position on the 
 WET. The National Small Wineries Coalition said:</para><para>During the last 15 years, successive Labor and Liberal Governments have imposed new taxes on the production of this agricultural product to the current 41%.</para><para>With their new-found influence the Democrats, for the first time, have joined these twoâ</para><para>and these are their wordsâ</para><para>rapacious and insensitive parties and this week announced that they will impose a new tax (WET), ratcheting up the total tax take from wineries to 49%.</para><para>They have tried to camouflage this black act with deceitful announcements that the rebate on cellar door sales provided by the states will continue.</para><para>In doing this, they have revealed the hollow nature of their action by capping this rebate to a ceiling of $300,000, that is 1500 cases of wine, that wineries can claim a 15% rebate on from their respective states, who have not even agreed to same.</para><para>It then says:</para><para>Meg Lees may finally meet her Waterloo following her own state, South Australia, announcing this morning that no such state arrangements were in place to support her hollow rebate gift.</para><para>This press release is dated 24 June 1999. If it has happened since then, we have not yet heard. In a press release that we received on 25 May, the National Small Wineries Coalition also said:</para><para>Clearly the big are benefiting at the expense of the small.</para><para>The Government, Democrats, Greens and Independents in their negotiations in respect to the GST have a golden opportunity to right the wrong that the WET proposal will inflict on society and small wine producers. To not do so will guarantee it becoming an electoral issue next time round.</para><para>I guess it will. In the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  of 25 June, Paul Cleary said:</para><para>The agreement from the Democrats to pass the WET legislation is contingent on the Government delivering on the rebates, which are of major benefit to small wineries.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Labor MP Mr David Cox, who also owns a small vineyard in McLaren Vale, revealed that South Australian Treasurer, Mr Rob Lucas, said the State had not been consulted on the reforms and, as a result, could not commit itself to the rebates. 
</para><para>"We have not been consulted so we cannot agree to anything," Mr Lucas told an estimates hearing.</para><para>This tells the story, I am afraid. The wine industry has clearly said that. This was one of the strongest issues on which I have heard a clear consensus across various groupsâwelfare, alcohol, Aboriginal, health and, in particular, the quality wine producers and small wineries. This issue deserves better consideration but, unfortunately, it seems to have been passed over in the hope that somehow or other it will work out okay. I am afraid that that is not the way to make legislation.</para><para>I am very concerned about this. When we come to voting on these issues, I hope there will be some rethinking of the issues. I guess it is too late in relation to the Australian Democrats. I am hoping that we will get a good response from members of the opposition because they have made such strenuous comments in expressing concern about the way the Democrats have negotiated this particular issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>6609</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make some brief comments, if I mayâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>âYou just made some comments a minute ago.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âSenator Cook does not wish me to, but I want to make some comments in relation to the <inline ref="r754">A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999</inline> .

The government is committed to the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations, and the two bills currently before the chamber will help to deliver this system. These bills represent an important step in improving the financial position of the states and territories.</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the April Premiers Conference, the heads of government endorsed an intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments are in the process of revising that agreement to take account of the Prime Minister's 28 May announcement. This agreement retains the core elements of the original agreement and places Commonwealth-state financial arrangements on a more efficient and durable basis. Once agreed by all parties, this revised agreement will be attached to the legislation and the legislation will record the Common 
 wealth's intention to comply with the agreement.</para><para>The amendments before us today are required to enact aspects of the reforms to the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements arising from these developments. The arrangements for transitional assistance are also modified to reflect the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the states. The level of assistance to the states and territories will be increased to reflect the changes in the level of GST revenues that will accrue to the states and territories. Also, as agreed by the heads of government, the distribution of GST revenue grants will be solely on the basis of horizontal fiscal equalisation after two years. Following the 28 May announcement, responsibility for local government funding will be retained at the Commonwealth level. Amendments are now required to ensure that local governments can receive financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth. A number of other additional amendments are required to address some technical matters.</para><para>This probably brings to an end the debate to amend the bills for the government's tax reform package. There will be a debate on diesel tomorrow, but a raft of important bills will now be voted on by the Senate. Let me make it clear that this is a great day for Australia. The Senate has, we believe, produced a tax reform package which, with the passage of the legislation, will give Australia a tax system which will set it up for the new century. It is a tax system which reforms, among other things, the indirect tax system, the income tax system and the financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth. It provides major real improvements for people on pensions and benefits, and it provides huge assistance to families in particular, which this government has always had a particular focus on.</para><para>In my view, the efforts of the Labor Party to  defeat  tax  reform  in Australia show how  
 far the Labor Party has fallen. The Labor Party refused to accept the mandate given to the government at the last election. We have been able to work very constructively with the Democrats. We have, I believe, produced a most effective tax reform package. As the weeks, months and years go by, I believe it will be very apparent what a momentous day this is for Australia. This is a day which has at last produced, after all the hard work over many years, major tax reform for this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âOrder!

There has been no indication whatsoever. They have made clear requests in relation to third readings but none in relation to amendments.

We obviously want to vote against the bills that impose the GST, and my understanding is that when we come to that point those bills will be put in a block to enable us to do so. We do not wish to vote against bills delivering tax cuts and other compensation for the GST, so we are happy for them to be put together.</para></talk.start><para>But what I am speaking about now is not any of that; it is about an understanding reached to deal with the order of business at the end of the proceedings. We have 26 bills and there are opposition amendments to a couple of them, and it would require only two questions to be presented to the chamber by the chair. One brace of opposition amendments relates to the imposition billsâthe excise bill, the customs bill and the general imposition billâthat is, there are three amendments: one to each of those bills. They could be put together. The next is the wine equalisation tax bill, and we have spoken on that in this debate. We would like that amendment to be put as well. All I am asking is that the amendments that we would like to have moved be put. That does not breach any understandings reached between the Manager of Government Business in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition.

There will be a need then for opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 1312 (revised) to be put to the ANTS wine equalisation tax bill. I believe that, if there is agreement there, leave can be sought for that. Then we will deal with the third reading, as has been discussed by the Manager of Government Business and me, and we can proceed in a sensible way. So, in answer to the Manager of Government Business's point, I think it requires two questions to be put and 
 two divisions in the committee stage, and then we can deal with the third reading in the way in which we understand.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âIs leave granted to put the opposition requests to the excise, customs and general bills?

 offset by reductions in excise to ensure that the price at the pump need not rise.</para><para>Recognising Australia's dependence on transport due to the vast size of our continent, we also promised the price of our major transport fuel, diesel, would fall and fall very substantially, to the benefit of businesses and consumers; in particular for those people living in regional, rural and remote areas where transport costs are a significant part of the cost of living and doing business.</para><para>Under this bill, the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill, and the environmental expenditure package agreed between the government and the Australian Democrats, there will be large and enduring benefits to regional Australia, to the environment and to transport operators in the road, rail and marine sectors.</para><para>And, contrary to what has been asserted by the Opposition, the government has effectively quarantined regional Australia from the impact of the changes negotiated with the Democrats. The cost of road transport provided by all articulated vehicles and other trucks servicing regional areas will fall under these arrangements.</para><para>To the extent that compromises have been necessary, they have been driven by environmental concerns in the cities, and it is city-based transport that will necessarily now not receive the full gains.</para><para>Businesses across Australia will all pay less for fuel than they do now because they will get back the GST paid on inputs, including fuel. It is expected that businesses should save around six to seven cents per litre by this measure alone, although the actual amount will not be determined until next year after the final pre-GST CPI adjustment to excise rates.</para><para>In addition to the GST input tax credits on fuel purchased, the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant Scheme will provide a further major cut in costsâwith grants in the order of 16 to 17 cents per litre of diesel used, for a wide variety of Australian businesses that provide transport services to country areas.</para><para>These include:</para><para>.	 interstate and city-country road transport;</para><para>.	 the transport of goods from all Australia's rural export regions and processing centres to their markets in the city or offshore;</para><para>.	 essential inputs being transferred from ports or factories in the city to the bush; and,</para><para>.	 the very bread and butter, indeed, all of the goods consumed by people living in country areas across this vast continent.</para><para>In addition to the grants available under this Scheme, which extend to cover alternative fuels, 
 the government is extending concessions available under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.</para><para>The major additional benefits are:</para><para>.	 recognition of the rail industry as an off-road user of diesel and the consequent extension to rail operators of the full rebate of excise on diesel.</para><para>.	 extension of the full rebate for diesel and like fuels to marine use and other existing qualifying uses, including agriculture, fishing and mining.</para><para>.	 however, in the case of forestry, this industry will continue to have access to the rebate in the proportion it currently receives.</para><para>Madam President</para><para>The government's objective has always been to reduce the price of transport fuels for business, however, in order to honour the agreement reached with the Democrats, it is no longer possible to deliver this through the tax system.</para><para>As the intention is to offset costs for only a specified part of the transport fleet and its usersâthose servicing regional areas, the tax system isâon legal adviceâan inappropriate means by which to deliver the benefits. Thus, we will deliver this measure through a grants scheme.</para><para>In addition to this, the use of a broad-ranging grants scheme will make the transition to the new, long-term scheme of Energy Credits, foreshadowed in the bill, much easier, reducing the impact on industry of multiple changes to arrangements.</para><para>As agreed between the government and the Democrats, the grant for diesel use in prescribed vehicles and prescribed areas will be set so as to provide a cumulative reduction in the cost of diesel by around 23 cents per litre, when the GST input tax credits are added in.</para><para>The bill not only provides grants for diesel fuel use, but also covers alternative fuels, including CNG and LPG, canola, ethanol and recycled oil. Grant rates for each of these fuels will be established by regulation so as to maintain the current price relativities between them and diesel, given that unlike diesel, they are not subject to excise. Additional fuels may be added by regulation.</para><para>The grants will be potentially available for all road transport vehicles above 4.5 tonnes, however, fuels used in vehicles between 4.5 tonnes and 20 tonnes Gross Vehicle Mass will qualify only in the following circumstances:</para><para>.	 if the vehicle is engaged in transporting goods or passengers within regional Australia;</para><para>.	 between a metropolitan area and a regional point (and vice-versa); or</para><para>.	 between metropolitan areas on an interstate journey.  
</para><para>Fuel used in vehicles of 20 tonnes or more Gross Vehicle Mass will qualify if used by a business for road transport, and if the business is registered for the purposes of the Scheme with the Australian Tax Office.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill contains some examples of qualifying journeys and I commend it to Senators.</para><para>Senators will recall that previously the ANTS package had proposed that diesel fuel credits be available to vehicles of 3.5 tonnes GVM or greater, however, this had the potential to encourage business operators to switch to heavier vehicles in order to capture the benefits of the diesel fuel credits. The result could also have been an unintended switch from petrol to diesel powered vehicles, with consequent increases in particulate emissions.</para><para>The use of 4.5 tonnes as the cut-off point under this bill for a grant scheme removes these unintended incentives. Four point five (4.5) tonnes is a natural cut-off point for vehicle classes because different licensing requirements apply at this levelâa truck driver's licence is needed to operate such vehicles.</para><para>In addition, very few transport vehicles use petrol at this new threshold. Some 99.9 per cent of articulated vehicles and 90.5 per cent of rigid trucks already use diesel, as do a similar percentage of the bus fleet. Thus, the scope for fuel switching in heavier vehicles is extremely limited under this bill.</para><para>In fact, viewed in the context of the full set of environmental commitments made by the government, particulates emissions in cities will actually fall substantially.</para><para>The Bureau of Transport Economics has estimated that, based on its projections of fuel use, reflecting anticipated growth in the national transport task, fuel use would have increased by approximately 50 per cent by 2015âand by more with the added economic stimulus of the tax package boosting national productivity and our export competitiveness.</para><para>As a result, there would have been a substantial increase in particulate matter emissionsâand I emphasise that this is the case with or without the new tax system.</para><para>In capital cities, where the health impacts and associated costs were likely to have been most noticed, this would have seen an increase from 5.7 Gigagrams of particulate emissions in 1997 to 10.3 Gigagrams by 2015.</para><para>With the establishment of</para><para>.	 standards for low sulphur diesel in 2002,</para><para>.	 incentives for the introduction of ultra low sulphur diesel from 2003 
</para><para>.	 the introduction of mandatory ultra low sulphur diesel standards from 2006, plus</para><para>.	 the vehicle emission standards to be determined and gazetted before this bill takes effect</para><para>it is now expected that particulate matter emissions across Australia will be no greater in 2015 than they were in 1997.</para><para>And in cities, where the issue is potentially at its most serious, pollutant levels should fall from the 5.7 Gigagrams noted earlier to 4.2 Gigagramsâa 26 per cent reduction.</para><para>I would like to underline what a great achievement this is when one considers the anticipated growth in the national transport task over this period that I have mentioned already.</para><para>Improved emission standards for both petrol and diesel vehicles are effectively incorporated into this bill.</para><para>Section 2 of the bill outlines the commitments we have given in this regard. The commencement of the act is contingent upon them being implemented in Australian Design Rules made under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989.</para><para>Dates of application have been specifically incorporated in the bill at the request of the Democrats and I am repeating their intent today, because of the complexity of the subject.</para><para>The outline in the bill in substance recognises our obligations to apply</para><para>.	 Euro 2 emission standards to all new light diesel in 2002; and continuing models from 2003;</para><para>.	 Euro 3 to all new medium and heavy diesel models in 2002; and continuing models from 2003;</para><para>.	 Euro 4 to all new diesel models from 2006; and continuing models from 2007;</para><para>.	 Euro 2 to all new petrol models from 2003; and continuing models from 2004; and</para><para>.	 Euro 3 to new petrol models from 2005; and continuing models from 2006.</para><para>The exception noted in the Section 2 of the bill is important. Our vehicle industry would have serious difficulty coping with the application of standards under Euro 4 for petrol vehicles. We thus have yet to make a commitment in that area, and the legislation is intended to reflect this.</para><para>Overall, the benefit is huge. These standards will mean that emission rates from oxides of nitrogen and particulates in new medium to heavy duty trucks will be</para><para>.	 40 per cent and 70 per cent lower respectively after 2002; and</para><para>.	 50  per cent and 90 per cent lower respectively after 2006 
</para><para>than they are in vehicles meeting current standards.</para><para>Madam President, suggestions have been made in the debate in the House on this bill that the emission standards were going to be put in place anyway. This is incorrect. The standards agreed with the Democrats go beyond what was already proposed.</para><para>The National Road Transport Commission, the body responsible for implementing the new standards and recognised by the Opposition as the authority on this subject, has confirmed this package exceeds significantly what was being contemplated.</para><para>It does this in three respects; firstly, it accelerates the implementation of Euro 3 standards for diesel vehicles; secondly, it provides for the introduction of Euro 4 standards for dieselâa move not previously contemplated; and thirdly, it delivers cleaner diesel fuel which had not previously been envisaged, which allows these standards and the benefits they offer to deliver much sooner.</para><para>Madam President, there has also been some acrimonious debate over carbon dioxide and related Greenhouse gas emissions, with the suggestion that greenhouse gas emissions will increase as a result of this package.</para><para>We need to get this issue straight. Greenhouse gas emissions are a serious matter; one which the government intends to address seriously. But expecting the tax package to solve such an issue is nonsense.</para><para>Greenhouse gases emitted by the transport sector continue to grow for a reasonâthe reason is that the economy continues to grow, and transport grows with it.</para><para>Moreover, there is nothing written in stone or derived from logic that says transport emissions must not rise. For Australia, the question must be what is the least-cost adjustment to reach the Kyoto Convention target, not simply transferring that target to each sector. Clearly, taxing our transport sector more heavily in order to suppress demand for transport is an unacceptable option, unless we are also attempting to suppress overall economic growth.</para><para>As a nation, we need to recognise diesel is our main heavy transport fuel.</para><para>The solution to lower emissions growth in transport lies with improved engine efficiency, use of Intelligent Transport Systems, better intermodal transfer efficiency, higher public transport efficiency and with better land use planning.</para><para>It is not affected in any substantial way by the price of fuel.</para><para>The price of fuel has been increased by taxation very significantly in Australia over many years, with not much impact on growth in demand for its 
 use. It is relative pricing that will matter, not the absolute level, as this bill itself demonstrates with its plan to maintain the differentials between fuels.</para><para>Under a high fuel tax regime, all that will change is the cost of doing business in Australia. And, for transport-dependent communities in regional Australia, that's not the soft option that it is for some city-based think tanks.</para><para>Madam President</para><para>We also intend that a further bill, putting in place the administrative arrangements, including the compliance mechanisms needed to support this bill, will be introduced by the government in the Spring Sittings in consultation with the Australian Democrats.</para><para>We will be seeking passage of the Administration bill prior to Christmas, in order that industry can develop record-keeping arrangements and plan with confidence for the introduction of the grants scheme on 1 July next year.</para><para>The administrative arrangements will be developed by the Australian Taxation Office in consultation with Australian National Audit Office and its views will be factored into the compliance and audit procedures.</para><para>The Opposition is trying to run a scare campaign on the question of how this scheme will be administered. In one breath it warns transport operators that they face onerous and intrusive compliance requirements. In the next breath it paints this as a scheme wide open to rorting. It is wrong on both counts.</para><para>The government will develop a robust risk management strategy that limits the scope for abuse, but also keeps record-keeping requirements as simple as possible.</para><para>Madam President, it is the government's intention that the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will sunset in mid-2002, and be replaced with an Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme.</para><para>The future Energy Grants Scheme will maintain benefits that are equivalent to those available under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Credit Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.</para><para>Very importantly, it is the government's intention that the Energy Grants Scheme will also provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels by measures additional to those available under the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme.</para><para>The detail of the Energy Grants Scheme will be developed jointly by the government and the Australian Democrats and introduced through a jointly sponsored bill. 
</para><para>Madam President, this bill is being introduced in a highly charged atmosphere, where emotion may cloud reason. However, there is every reason for all Senators to support itâbecause lower transport costs benefit all Australians; and because of the significant improvements to emission standards inherent in it.</para><para>This bill makes a substantial contribution to the case for tax reformâfor without tax reform, the funding required to support it would simply not be available.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE AMENDMENT (DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME) BILL 1999</para><para>The Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999 implements changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000.</para><para>The broad details of the environmental package in so far as it applies to the use of diesel and alternative fuels has been covered in the second reading speech introducing the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme Bill 1999, as have the broad details of changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.</para><para>The main features of the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999 are as follows:</para><para>It introduces a 100 per cent rebate for all diesel used by registered businesses in rail transport and in the marine industry.</para><para>It provides for the rebates available for diesel to also be made available to qualifying users of like fuels such as light fuel oil and bunker fuel. These like fuels will be prescribed.</para><para>The full rebate will be extended to existing qualifying users, including agriculture, fishing and mining, as well as private residences, bush and other nursing homes, hospitals and aged persons home.</para><para>This means that the government intends to rebate all the excise paid on diesel and like fuels for use in primary production, and all currently qualifying mining uses. Currently they do not receive a full rebate. Forestry will continue to have access to the rebate in the proportion it currently receives.</para><para>The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will sunset on 30 June 2002 and benefits equivalent to those available under it will be grandfathered into the new Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme that will come into effect on 1 July 2002. 
</para><para>Madam President</para><para>Those off-road businesses that receive rebates under this scheme can be assured that the government will ensure these benefits are not diminished under the new Energy Grants Scheme.</para><para>I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned till the first day of sitting in the spring sittings 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>6631</page.no><id.no>r810</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 1999-2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r807</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 2) 1999-2000</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r809</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>6631</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>6631</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>6631</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>â</para><para>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1999-2000</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to appropriate the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the expenses of the Parliamentary Departments for the year ending 30 June 2000.</para><para>The total amount sought is $161.5 million.

This government wants to improve the assistance that families can get through the tax and social security systems.</para><para>This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to introduce improvements to the assistance currently provided by government to families.</para><para>Specifically, this bill:</para><para>.	 extends qualification for family allowance so that it covers both job seekers and students who have turned l 6, and continues until age 21 for job seekers, and until age 25 for full-time students;</para><para>.	 increases the fortnightly rate of family allowance to $50, payable in respect of a young person who is aged 18 to under 21, or who is undertaking full-time study and is aged 21 to under 25; and</para><para>.	 ensures that certain young persons are not inadvertently deprived of a health care card by force of these amendments. 
</para><para>These amendments will commence with effect from 1 October 1999, and will provide assistance to families of $42 million in the 1999-2000 financial year, making a positive impact on the living standards of Australian families, particularly those with low incomes.</para><para>Complementary amendments to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999 will take effect from the commencement of that act, that is 1 July 2000, to ensure the continuance of these changes under the government's tax reform package.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) BILL 1999</para><para>Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1999 gives effect to a number of changes to the Professional Services Review Scheme (PSR). The PSR is the government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice under Medicare or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>The PSR commenced in July 1994, and has always enjoyed the support of all parties in this Parliament. I would like to thank the opposition and the other parties for their continued support of this legislation.</para><para>The changes contained in this bill have come in the wake of criticism of some aspects of from the Federal Court. A review was undertaken by a Committee chaired by the Australian Medical Association.</para><para>The review confirmed the profession's and the Government's continued support for a peer review based Scheme. The amendments to the act will enhance the administration of the Scheme to ensure that the process is fairer and more transparent.</para><para>The investigation and negotiation powers of the Director of the PSR will be increased. There will be greater legal support to the peer review committees and for the person under review. The Determining Officer, currently from the Department of Health and Aged Care, will be replaced with a Determining Authority. The Determining Authority will comprise a medical practitioner as the permanent chair, a permanent lay person and a third member who is a representative of the profession of the person under review. The PSR Tribunals will be removed from the process whilst retaining the right of review on points of law.</para><para>There will be a range of different methods contained in the substance of the bill, to investigate inappropriate practice. 
</para><para>For example, deeming provisions will apply to all consultation services on all days where the services exceed the number set out in the regulation. There will be provisions for exceptional circumstances. A finding of inappropriate practice can only be made under the deeming provisions within the committee peer review structure. These deeming provisions have been agreed to with the profession.</para><para>The changes will greatly enhance the profession's ability to decide what constitutes inappropriate practice. I wish to particularly commend the medical profession for its contribution to the development of this framework. This bill will strengthen the Scheme and address the deficiencies identified by the Courts.</para><para>Medicare is one of the largest programs administered by the Federal Government, costing around $7 billion this year. We need to protect this investment. The Review Committee found that both suspension from Medicare and repayment of Medicare benefits should be applied in circumstances where there has been consistent rorting. The Government endorses this view.</para><para>With the improvement of natural justice principles in the bill, it is proposed that avenues of appeal to Professional Services Review Tribunals be abolished. This recognises that peer review is the basis of the Scheme. The person under review will have full rights to seek judicial review at any stage of the process.</para><para>The bill also addresses the question of the adequacy of practice records maintained by practitioners under review. From 1 November 1999, a practitioner appearing before a Committee will need to demonstrate that his or her medical records are adequate and accessible.</para><para>The new arrangements will be introduced in such a way as to not disadvantage any practitioner whose conduct has already been referred to the PSR. Where a referral has been made by the Health Insurance Commission to the Director under the existing legislation, the inquiry will be conducted and concluded under the rules that currently apply.</para><para>This legislation strengthens a Scheme that has always enjoyed the full support of this Parliament. With such an investment in Medicare, all Governments over the last five years have agreed a Professional Services Review Scheme is necessary.</para><para>PROTECTION OF MOVABLE CULTURAL HERITAGE AMENDMENT BILL 1999</para><para>Australia's heritage comprises more than our built and natural environment, our traditions and languages. It is also the objects we create or collect, known as our movable cultural heritage. This might include anything from artworks to 
 fossils, historic manuscripts to steam engines, Aboriginal sacred/secret material to Don Bradman's cricket bat.</para><para>The most significant of these items are defined as `Australian protected objects' and their export is regulated by the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. Without limiting general international trade in cultural commodities, the objective of the act is to ensure that our most precious heritage items are not lost to the nation.</para><para>The act provides for the establishment of a National Cultural Heritage Fund to facilitate the acquisition of Australian protected objects. It was envisaged that the responsible Minister could provide grants from the Fund to assist a public cultural institution such as a museum or archive to purchase a cultural item which cannot be exported because its export would be of great cultural loss to Australia.</para><para>The Fund would therefore help to provide public access to these significant cultural items and, as part of permanent collections, to keep them available for the delight and education of future generations of Australians.</para><para>Further, people who own an item for which an export permit has been refused will have more opportunity to sell the item to a public museum or comparable institution for a fair market price. The act could then operate more equitably.</para><para>The previous Government, however, never provided an appropriation to allow the Fund to come into operation. More than ten years after the commencement of the act, the Fund is still no more than an empty provision in the act.</para><para>This Government is redressing the oversight. $0.5 million is to be allocated to establish the National Cultural Heritage Account from the 1999-2000 Budget appropriation for the administered expenses for the outcome `a cultural environment that enriches the lives of all Australians'. It is expected that the account will be maintained at that level over time.</para><para>In order to operate the Account, however, it is necessary to replace outdated references to the Audit Act 1901 and to bring the financial arrangements into line with the regime established by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.</para><para>The bill therefore repeals section 25 of the act relating to the National Cultural Heritage Fund and replaces it with three new provisions relating to the National Cultural Heritage Account, which will be a Special Account for the purposes of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The bill makes a number of other minor consequential amendments necessitated by this change.</para><para></para><para>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</para><para>The commencement of the Aged Care Act on 1 October 1997 saw the implementation of legislation that guarantees an aged care system that maintains the comfort and dignity of older Australians in a way that is viable and sustainable.</para><para>I am very pleased to introduce today the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999, which will introduce further resident protections, implement an election commitment and improve administration of the act.</para><para>The bill is further proof of the Government's commitment to achieving excellence in care for older Australians in residential care. This commitment has been demonstrated by the increased outlays on residential care under this Government, by the growth in care places and by the recognition of the complex care needs of residents of aged care facilities. The bill further extends the work already done by the Government to improve the residential aged care system in Australia.</para><para>The Government remains committed to bringing about real improvement to nursing homes, too many of which were simply not in a condition when we entered Government to provide a safe, comfortable and dignified home for older Australians. They deserve better.</para><para>The accommodation charge takes account of the special circumstances of nursing home level residents, and maintains the principle of people making a contribution to improving the quality of their accommodation where they can afford to do so. Protections exist for those residents who are unable to contribute in this way.</para><para>There are no changes to the quantum or the nature of the accommodation charges, which have been operating since 6 November 1997 through subordinate legislation. This bill formalises those measures in principal legislation to ensure a range of resident protection measures for accommodation charges, in line with those currently applying to accommodation bonds.</para><para>The bill also ensures that where a nursing home level resident chooses to rent out a former family home to pay for the accommodation charge, the rental income earned does not affect their pension entitlements. This means that a resident can retain the full pension while earning rental income. This bill amends the Social Security Act and the Veteran's Entitlement's Act to exclude this rental income and the value of the property from the pension income and assets test.</para><para>The new measures will also maintain, but through principal legislation, flexibility and choice for older Australians who move between different types of residential care. Where residents have previously 
 paid a bond in a hostel, and would prefer to roll over this bond when they move to a nursing home instead of paying an accommodation charge, they will continue to have the option of agreeing with the provider to roll over the bond.</para><para>Concessional residents, or those who qualify under the hardship provisions, will not be required to pay any accommodation charge. In addition, this bill widens the definition of concessional resident, to enable more older Australians to be classed as concessional residents and to ensure that they will not be asked to pay an accommodation bond or charge.</para><para>The bill extends many of the consumer protections that currently apply to accommodation bonds to also cover accommodation charges, and requires aged care providers to meet a range of responsibilities in relation to the charge.</para><para>This bill also implements the Government's 1999 Budget commitment to protect those older Australians who were in a nursing home when the Aged Care Act 1997 was introduced from paying an accommodation charge if they later move to another nursing home. Those nursing home residents who were in care at that time and who have moved or will move to another home will now be exempted from paying the accommodation charge.</para><para>People who were residents of a nursing home when the Aged Care Act 1997 was introduced and who have moved and paid a charge in another home will be refunded for the accommodation charges they have already paid. These refunds will not affect their pension entitlements.</para><para>Providers will not only be reimbursed for the amount lost in refunded accommodation charges but will be more than compensated through the maximum rate of concessional resident supplement.</para><para>The Government also remains committed to those who devote themselves to caring for older people in their own homes. The bill reduces from 5 to 2 years the period during which a resident's home must have been occupied by a carer in order for the resident to qualify as a concessional or assisted resident. This change will make it easier for residents to qualify, and attract a higher level of Government subsidy. It will also mean that carers will be able to remain in the family homeâfurther recognising the vital role that carers play.</para><para>The bill also addresses anomalies in the Aged Care Act 1997 in relation to the revocation of approved provider status and the imposition of sanctions for breaches of provider responsibilities under the previous legislation. Provisions will be introduced which will enable the Commonwealth to take strong and decisive action against those providers, for example, who have been convicted of serious crimes, such as the abuse of residents or fraud. The Government is committed to ensuring that only 
 those providers who meet their responsibilities will be able to provide care to the most frail and vulnerable in our society.</para><para>It has also come to the attention of the Government that the responsibilities of providers in relation to the kinds of fees intending residents can be asked to pay needs to be clarified. The bill makes it very clear that intending residents cannot be asked to pay fees until after they have agreed to accept a place, following notification of a place being available.</para><para>The bill makes provision for a number of other important changes to ensure better protection for both residents and providers. Concessional resident status is extended to cover residents whose home is occupied by dependent grandchildren. The bill allows for the extension of time limits for entering an agreement for those residents who wish to appoint a guardian to handle their affairs. The bill also provides for extensions to approvals in principles for additional recurrent funding, where providers need to additional time to improve their facilities.</para><para>These issues are the result of the Government listening to and responding to these issues. We have acted in a sensitive way to keep the benefits of the aged care reforms flowing to residents, now and in the future.</para><para>The amendments clarify and improve the current arrangements set out in the Aged Care Act 1997âthe legislation that has seen the most comprehensive and significant reform to the provision of aged care services in Australia over the last decade. This legislation, that by encouraging innovation, flexibility and creativity in service delivery and planning, will maintain the provision of appropriate, responsive and quality aged care into the next century.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Brien</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper </inline>as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>6635</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bills:</para><para>Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998</para><para>Telstra (Further Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1998</para><para>Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1998</para><para>Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Amendment Bill 1998

The tabling of the report in this parliament, and its subsequent distribution to interested parties and the wider community, should now be a catalyst for the resolution of the policy and political impasse which has dogged the future of junior wages in Australia for most of this decade.</para><para>The report is an extensive body of work commissioned by this legislature, conducted over six months in an inquisitorial manner, rather than the more traditional adversarial approach of Commission litigation. It follows an independent public inquiry by the Commission that drew together oral 
 and written submissions from all major stakeholders, including most of the historical participants in this debate. Being an inquisitorial process, the report makes no orders, decisions or recommendations, but in its own words, assists in resolving issues about the content of legislation and may serve to inform debate and future industrial policy (p. 8).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Challenge for this Parliament</inline></para><para>The report concludes that the Commission could not find any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives to age-based junior rates of pay. Such a finding is crucial to the central policy questions that now confront this parliament.</para><para>Will the parliament legislate to permanently retain the existing system of junior rates? Will it remove the statutory scheme first introduced by the Keating government in 1993 which prima facie declares junior rates to be discriminatory and not to be made, or where made to be removed?</para><para>In the light of this report, these questions must now be unequivocally answered in the affirmative. Junior rates must stay, and where appropriate be extended throughout the workforce.</para><para>The opportunist political cover behind which the Labor Party and its leadership chose to hide on this issue has been its calls for an AIRC inquiry.</para><para>That cover has now disappeared. The AIRC has reported. The Labor Party is exposed. Its political posturing has now been revealed as a sham. It has misread the debate and mislead the community, hoping beyond hope that an alternative would emerge behind which it could again cower in shallow opposition. Yet the AIRC has rightly repudiated each and every Labor sponsored alternative as being fundamentally flawed and in some cases even itself discriminatory.</para><para>As unpalatable as it may be, Labor now has to do what the public interest dictated many months agoâto make a real decisionâa choice between protecting jobs for young Australians in urban, regional and rural areas or negative opposition-for-opposition sake posturing.</para><para>There is no doubt this is a dilemma for Mr. Beazley, who only this week confided to his caucus that over the coming months Labor could be portrayed in a negative position on industrial relations.</para><para>If Labor repudiates this report from the independent umpire and again rejects the Coalition's legislation to rectify Labor's flawed policy to abolish junior wages then it imposes not just a self inflicted wound of negativity, but more importantly, jeopardises the jobs of tens of thousands of young Australians. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The AIRC Conclusions</inline></para><para>In reaching its conclusions on this central issue, the report supports the core propositions that the federal Coalition government and the governments of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have consistently advanced in this debate and before the Commission. These conclusions are:</para><para>.	 That there is an undisputable relationship between junior rates, their potential abolition and the employment prospects of young people (pp. xiv; 157, 165);</para><para>.	 That a discounted pay rate for entry level work continues to be necessary in the areas in which employment under junior rate classifications is most concentrated, and that well designed junior rate classifications may even create or protect employment opportunities, including in the building and construction industries (pp. xiii, xvi, 140-141, 189, 191, 201);</para><para>.	 That the system of junior rates has been used as a wage reference for young people for decades, is simple to understand and administer, and has active employment under it (pp. x; xv, 65-66, 138);</para><para>.	 That none of the proposed alternatives to junior rates are feasible because they either are more complex, overvalue the work of employees, are themselves discriminatory or have considerable adverse cost effects (p. ix, 168-172, 206-212);</para><para>.	 That the removal of junior rates or the introduction of adult rates at 18 years would significantly disemploy young Australians, that is lead to large scale job losses (pp. xiv, 165, 207);</para><para>.	 That the current legislative scheme, unless amended by the parliament, amounts to a rebuttable presumption that junior rates be removed from June 2000 (pp. xi; 88);</para><para>.	 That, for a range of reasons, the labour force participation of young people is already relatively parlous and relatively scarce, and that changes that might have the effect of significantly increasing the relative cost of teenage labour beyond its real value to an employer may make teenage employment even more precarious, especially in regional and country Australia (pp. xiii, xiv; 151, 154, 199);</para><para>.	 That if young people are to secure entry level employment and progress to economic self sufficiency through paid employment they more than ever need to be competitive in the labour market (pp. x, 15);</para><para>.	 That junior rates are often a useful bridge to full time employment, especially for the educationally better qualified (p. xv); and 
</para><para>.	 That the government submissions on the youth labour market and on the adverse consequences for young people on the abolition of junior rates have been broadly adopted, and that similar conclusions by bodies such as the Productivity Commission are supported (pp. xiii; 154, 163-165).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Junior Wage Debate</inline></para><para>Before turning to the details of the report, it is necessary to put the AIRC's Inquiry into the context of the wider debate over junior rates.</para><para>Junior rates have been a feature of the wages system in Australia since early this century. Age-based junior rates of pay are set as a percentage of the adult rate, and usually increase annually until adult rates are payable. Over 400,000 young people under 21 are paid junior wagesâthis represents over half of all employed young people in Australia.</para><para>Junior rates have been under direct legislative threat since the Labor government of 1993. Under the existing provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Act 1996 </inline> (WRA), the continuation of junior rates in awards cannot be guaranteed after 22 June 2000.</para><para>Because of the importance of junior rates for getting young people into jobs, the Coalition Government's preferred position has always been that junior rates should be allowed to continue indefinitely. In 1996 the Government agreed as a temporary measure to extend the then exemption for a further three years, and to put in place a mechanism for the AIRC to review the feasibility of abolishing junior rates of pay. This reflected a compromise position only agreed to by the Government as a way of avoiding Labor's legislated removal of junior wages. The Coalition agreed to the review on the clear understanding that our policy would continue to be for the retention of junior rates and that we would seek a mandate for this legislation at the next election, which we didâand obtained.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The AIRC Report</inline></para><para>The AIRC report was prepared by a Full Bench of the Commission to fulfil the requirements of Section 120B of the WRA which requires a Full Bench to prepare a report assessing one primary question and three secondary questions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">No Feasible Non-discriminatory Alternatives Exist</inline></para><para>The primary question answered by the Inquiry was whether there are any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives to junior rates. The AIRC could not find any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives (Para [2] of the Summary). Those who want junior rates abolished had every opportunity to put alternatives to the Inquiry. Many tried to do so. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian 
 Council of Social Services, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and the CFMEU all took up the challenge and put alternatives to the Inquiry. Not one of these proposals were found by the Full Bench to qualify as non-discriminatory and feasible.</para><para>The first of the secondary questions considered by the Inquiry was whether it is desirable to replace junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. The Full Bench concludes that an assessment of the desirability of replacing junior rates would require a balance to be struck between the pros and cons of junior rates. It considered that no useful purpose would be served by the Bench making that kind of assessment in the abstract (Para 4.4.3).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Significant Disemploying Effects if Junior Rates Abolished</inline></para><para>The next secondary question considered by the report was an assessment of the consequences for youth employment of abolishing junior rates. The Inquiry found that the removal and non-replacement of the existing wage discounts embodied in junior rates would have significant disemploying effects for young people (Para 5.6.12). The report notes that this finding was not seriously challenged by the participants in the Inquiry. The Report indicates that when given the opportunity to respond to this finding, the ACTU did not seek to address directly the finding or the substantial weight of economic opinion on which it is based.</para><para>Significantly, the Inquiry then used its finding about the disemploying effects of removing junior rates to assess the consequences for youth employment of alternatives that would apply adult rates at 18. The Inquiry found that for most 18 year olds and above, the application of full adult rates would cause an overvaluation of the work performed, and would be expected to reduce the employment prospects of the 18 to 20 years old age group (Para 5.8.7).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Junior Rates Have High Utility Value</inline></para><para>The third of the secondary questions addressed by the report was the utility of junior rates for different types of employment, for different industries, and in the school-to-work transition. The Inquiry found that well-designed junior rate classifications, framed to reduce capacity to exploit the use of them, may justifiably be used for creating or protecting employment opportunities for young people (Para [9](v) of the Summary). The Report also concluded that the role and usefulness of junior rates is best demonstrated in the school-to-work transition, and in school and work interfaces (Para 6.4.11).</para><para>The Inquiry found that junior rates had high utility for the retail industry and the hospitality and accommodation industries (Para 6.3.1). Significantly, the report also concludes that an expanded 
 application of junior rates in the building and construction industry could, with some qualifications, result in expanded opportunities for youth employment (Para 6.3.14).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Additional Independent Support for Junior Rates</inline></para><para>The AIRC also noted the existence of strong economic evidence in support of its conclusions. The AIRC Report made use of a major study by the Productivity Commission entitled <inline font-style="italic">Youth Wages and Employment. </inline> That found that a 1 per cent increase in youth wages would lead to a decrease in youth employment of 2 per cent in the retail industry, 5 per cent in the accommodation industry, and 2.5 per cent in the cultural and recreational services industry.</para><para>This is consistent with the overwhelming body of international and Australian evidence, ranging from one of the world's leading authorities on labour demand Professor Daniel Hamermesh, to the Australian Retailers Association which estimated that 170,000 to 180,000 junior jobs would be lost from the retail industry alone if junior rates were abolished.</para><para>Recently both the UK Low Pay Commission established by the Blair Labour Government and the Irish National Minimum Wage Commission recognised the need to discount minimum wages for young people to ensure they are not disadvantaged in the labour market.</para><para>In fact, the Blair Labour Government not only received the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission recommending a minimum junior rate, but then proceeded of its own motion to further discount that recommended minimum out of concern for the youth labour market.</para><para>Every state and territory government in Australia has the power to legislate to end the use of junior rates. None have done so. Other OECD countries that have minimum wages that provide significant protection for the low paid also typically have lower minimum wages for young people.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Government's Youth Employment Bill</inline></para><para>The AIRC Report is overwhelming evidence in the case for retaining our system of junior rates, and making junior rates more widely available. The continued existence of junior rates is essential to protect the employment prospects of young people. They help young people get that first foothold in the labour market that is critically important for their future career. With teenage unemployment above 24 per cent, everything possible must be done to assist young people into work.</para><para>Of course, the preservation and expansion of junior rates is not the whole answer to reducing youth unemployment. Rather, it is an integral element of the Government's strategy that includes a well 
 managed growing economy, initiatives to increase school retention rates and raise literacy and numeracy standards, the expansion of the apprenticeship system, and the assistance provided to unemployed youth through the job network and mutual obligation.</para><para>Our response to the need to protect junior rates is the <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998,</inline>  which the Government introduced last November. The Bill, when passed, would preserve and enhance the job prospects of young people by protecting the existing system of junior rates and, where appropriate, by extending junior rates to awards that do not currently contain them. The Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1999 but was rejected by the Senate on 8 March 1999.</para><para>In light of the AIRC Report and because of the important role junior rates play in getting young people into jobs, the Government will be re-introducing the Youth Employment Bill.</para><para>A number of members who previously spoke against the Bill did so on the ground that it should not have been brought forward until after the tabling of the AIRC's report on junior rates. Their initial opposition to the Bill appears to have been determined by timing and process issues, rather than by the merits of the Bill itself. This difficulty that some members had with the initial Bill has now been removed.</para><para>And, as I said earlier, the Labor Party must now come clean with a position for or against junior wages and youth employment.</para><para>On behalf of the Government and all members, I thank the Full Bench of the AIRC for its important work on this matter of public importance, as well as the participants to the inquiry.</para><para>I commend the Report to this parliament and urge honourable members to use its conclusions as the basis for setting aside past policy differences, and securing the passage of the Government's Youth Employment Bill when reintroduced into this place.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Government response to the Senate Economics References Committee 1998 report entitled Review of the Inquiry into Outworkers in the Garment Industry.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INTRODUCTION</inline></para><para>The Government response to the Senate Economics References Committee 1998 <inline font-style="italic">Review of the Inquiry into Outworkers in the Garment Industry</inline>  is in two parts.

Following protracted and difficult negotiations, the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia (TFIA), the Australian Industry Group (AIG), Australian Business Limited (ABL) and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia (TCFUA) agreed in November 1997 to commit to a unified Manufacturers' Code of Practice (the code) for the employment of local outworkers in the clothing industry.</para><para>The industry-driven code is designed to combat the exploitation of outworkers by specifying their entitlements and by obliging manufacturers and contractors to contractually assure outworkers that they will receive those entitlements.</para><para>A Code of Practice Committee comprised of employer and union representatives oversees the successful implementation of the code, and is responsible for the accreditation of qualified manufacturers and for educating outworkers on their entitlements under the code.</para><para>Through the former Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, the Government signed an agreement with the code signatories in July 1998 to provide significant funding ($302 000) to support an education campaign to help implement the code of practice. The education campaign will commence in 1999 for approximately twelve months, with the code itself to continue indefinitely. Major activities of the education campaign include the development of a licensing system for approved products and related labelling, the recruitment and training of bilingual outreach workers, a seminar program in major employment centres and provision of multi-lingual publications on the code.</para><para>Another key component of the education campaign, which the grantees have agreed to undertake and for which the Government will provide significant funding, is the development of a `Product Rate Manual' (or sewing time manual). This will involve the engagement of a methods engineering consultant, the purchase of relevant software, practical testing and trialing, and the finalisation and broad distribution of the manual. The intended outcome is to establish accurate task details and fair remu 
 neration rates for outworkers employed on the range of common garment assembly activities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) Advisory Board</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.17	 The committee welcomes the Government's appointment of a new TCF Advisory Board to provide industry-based advice to the Productivity Commission. However, the committee believes a working party or committee should be established within the board to deal specifically with outworkers issues.</inline></para><para>Noted. The TCF Advisory Board was established by the then Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon John Moore MP, primarily to act as a source of industry-based advice to him and the Government, during the 1996-97 process of the Productivity Commission review of the TCF industries and the Government's response in setting the post-2000 TCF policy framework.</para><para>With that now completed, the future of the TCF Advisory Board is uncertain. In any case, the Code of Practice Committee, referred to in the response to paragraph 1.16, appears to be better-placed to address these issues.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government procurement practices</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.21	 The committee suggests the Federal Government follow the lead of the New South Wales Government by directing departments and agencies who deal with clothing procurement to enter into deeds of co-operation along the lines of the New South Wales code.</inline></para><para>Noted. As the purchasing of clothing is concentrated in a few agencies, and aligned with the devolution of financial responsibilities under the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> , it is considered more practicable to approach the top buying agencies, and encourage them to enter deeds of cooperation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Government assistance</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.25	 The committee recommends that only retailers and manufacturers who sign the agreement should benefit from industry assistance and support.</inline></para><para>Not agreed. The Manufacturers' Code of Practice is intended as a voluntary mechanism for encouraging fair and equitable working conditions for outworkers and has been supported by the Government on this basis. The education and information activities being part-funded by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources are regarded as the principal means by which the Government sees participation in the code being extended.</para><para>The Government is of the view that it would be inappropriate to limit industry assistance and support to those manufacturers and retailers who are signatories for the following reasons: 
</para><para>.	 the industry associations are signatories to the code and have undertaken to encourage full participation by their members. It would be impractical to get all 6000 plus establishments in the TCF industry to be signatories;</para><para>.	 many firms in the TCF industry do not use outworkers and it would be inappropriate to get them to sign;  and</para><para>.	 it does not necessarily follow that because a firm is not a signatory to the code or is not a member of the industry associations which are signatories, that the firm itself is not complying with all the appropriate conditions on employee entitlements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Deeming outworkers as employees</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.31	 From the perspective of outworkers it is vital their employment status is resolved.</inline></para><para>Noted. The then Labour Ministers' Council (LMC) agreed, on 27 November 1998, to establish a Departments of Labour Standing Committee (DOLAC) Working Party on Outworkers to examine and provide a draft report to the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council (WRMC) on options for action to clarify the employment status of outworkers in the garment industry. The working party will develop a working definition of `outworkers' and will have regard to:</para><para>.	 reports of the Senate Economics References Committee on outworkers in the garment industry;</para><para>.	 existing Commonwealth and State legislation on the employment status of outworkers and other relevant issues;</para><para>.

The Government should intervene and support this outcome to ensure that mechanisms continue to exist in the award to ensure that award pay and conditions are honoured for outworkers.</inline></para><para>Noted. The Commonwealth intervened in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) proceedings regarding the simplification of the outworker provisions in the <inline font-style="italic">Clothing Trades Award</inline><inline font-style="italic">1982</inline> .</para><para>The Commonwealth contended that the award clauses dealing with outworkers (clauses 26, 27 and 27A) were, generally, allowable and provided a foundation of fair minimum standards for the

There is federal, State and Territory legislation addressing the minimum age for certain occupations (for example work in underground mines, at sea and in licensed premises), occupational health and safety, compulsory attendance at school and child welfare, which provides an adequate framework to regulate and control the employment of young children. If governments consider that there is a significant problem in any of these areas, the aforementioned legislation should be able to deal with it. While the employment of children is primarily the jurisdictional responsibility of State and Territory governments, the Commonwealth Government is working with them, particularly on the development of international standards.</para><para>The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is developing a new convention, specifically addressing hazardous and exploitative forms of child labour. Australia supports this ILO initiative, as it will more appropriately target the problem of exploitative child labour than does the current relevant standard (Convention No. 138 dealing with minimum age for employment).</para><para>The Government has responded to the ILO questionnaire on the proposed new convention and actively participated in the discussions at the 1998 International Labour Conference. The texts of the new standards are expected to be finalised at the June 1999 conference.</para><para>Australia is working towards the adoption of sufficiently flexible new instruments which focus on eliminating extreme or exploitative forms of child labour, and which can be ratified by all countries.

The homework instruments and the associated report were ready to be tabled on 2 September 1998 when the federal election was called. Subsequently, Queensland advised some modifications to its position, following the change of government in that State. In light of this information a revised report was submitted to the Minister and tabled in the House of Representatives on 3 December 1998 and the Senate on 8 December 1998.</para><para>This report states that the Commonwealth has determined that the new ILO instruments concerning homework are not suitable for acceptance. A preliminary examination of current Australian law and practice for the new homework instruments indicates that there are compliance difficulties. At this stage, Australia does not propose to consider ratification of the convention.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Occupational health and safety issues</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.47	 The committee strongly recommends that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) examine Dr Mayhew's report with the view to implementing its recommendations in the very near future.</inline></para><para>Noted.</para><para>(a) The Commonwealth Government recognises that Australia's occupational health and safety performance needs to be improved. The Government therefore endorses the recommendation that OHS guidance material be developed on TCF machining work. Such guidance material should help improve the OHS performance in the garment industry for both factory-based workers and outworkers.</para><para>In 1998, as part of an Outworker Information Campaign, conducted jointly by the then Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business and the Office of the Employment Advocate, a publication was released entitled <inline font-style="italic">Occupational Health and Safety: Outworkers in the Clothing Industry</inline> . The publication contained health and safety information, relevant to outworkers, provided by the NOHSC. The publication was printed in English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Laotian, Cambodian, Macedonian and Turkish languages.</para><para>One of the key priorities for the NOHSC in 1999 relates to the development of a national inventory on industry-based OHS guidance material. The Government would expect that any OHS guidance material on TCF machining work would be included as part of this development.</para><para>(b) While primary responsibility for publicising and enforcement of OHS duty of care in TCF industries rests with the States and Territories, the Commonwealth Government does have an overall interest in improving OHS performance. In this regard, the Commonwealth is working with the States and Territories on a number of initiatives to address workplace safety and such measures should flow onto TCF industries. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Collection of statistical data</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.47b	 The committee still considers the information on the exact numbers of outworkers is essential for policy development, and recommends that the ABS survey scheduled for July 1999 includes specific questions on outworkers.</inline></para><para>Noted. As indicated in the Government response to the Senate Economics References Committee Report (tabled in Parliament on 3 September 1997) the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) planned to investigate ways of better identifying outworkers in its Persons Employed at Home Survey (PEH). This investigation has now taken place and it has been concluded that there are only limited improvements that can be made to this survey to better measure outworkers.</para><para>While the questions used in the survey are appropriate for identifying outworkers in the garment industry, the design of the survey makes it difficult to obtain an accurate measure of outworkers in the garment industry. The PEH is conducted as a supplement to the Monthly Labour Force Survey (MLFS) and will cover approximately 26 000 households. The MLFS is designed to be representative across the Australian population. However, it may not be representative for groups within the Australian population that are relatively small and/or not evenly spread throughout the general population.</para><para>The cost of allocating additional sample for the PEH, or adopting targeted collection techniques to ensure an accurate measure of outworkers in the garment industry, would be substantial and is currently beyond the resources of the ABS. Without these enhancements, the PEH is unlikely to accurately capture a significantly large and representative selection of outworkers in the garment industry in its sample.</para><para>Notwithstanding this constraint, an important modification is being considered for the PEH. The proposal is to expand the scope of the survey to include other persons working at locations that are not those of their employer/client. This would improve the coverage of the survey in relation to outworkers in the garment industry to the extent that they are employed at locations other than their own homes.</para><para>However, initial testing of the expanded survey has not proven satisfactory and further development work is needed. As a result, the survey is no longer planned for July 1999 and will be rescheduled for some time in 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">English language training</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.50	 It is essential that new migrants are targeted for language training.</inline></para><para>Noted. The two most relevant language training options for newly-arrived migrants are the Adult 
 Migrant English Program (AMEP) and the Workplace English Language and Literacy (WELL) Programme.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The Adult Migrant English Program </inline></para><para>The AMEP is administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). Under the AMEP all newly arrived migrants who are assessed as not having functional English are entitled to a maximum of 510 hours of English tuition. All new migrants must register within three months of arrival in Australia or grant of permanent residence, commence their English tuition within one year and complete the tuition within three years. Deferral can be sought, however, through applying to an AMEP service provider.</para><para>Under the accredited curriculum framework used in the AMEP, English competencies are taught in the context of living and working in Australia.</para><para>Arrangements for AMEP delivery include a range of measures to ensure that the program maximises its reach to those who are eligible. These measures include:</para><para>.	 free child care provided to clients with children who are below school age;</para><para>.	 teaching facilities close to where clients live and work;</para><para>.	 flexible delivery, including classes in community settings and in the evenings and weekends, as needed by clients;</para><para>.	 provisions for Distance Learning and Home Tutor options for clients who are unable or unwilling to attend classroom-based tuition;  and</para><para>.	 referral of clients to training options beyond the AMEP.</para><para>Outworkers are most likely to have come to Australia under family sponsorship and gone directly into the community. Only about 57 per cent of family migrants who have an entitlement to the AMEP take up their entitlement (as compared to 87 per cent of refugee and humanitarian entrants) and the average time spent by this group in the program is 305 hours out of an entitlement of 510 hours.</para><para>DIMA is working with AMEP service providers to improve reach and participation, and this work includes targeting clients by country of birth, gender and place of residence.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The WELL Programme</inline></para><para>The WELL Programme is funded by the Commonwealth through the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) and targets workers who need English language and literacy assistance in the context of occupational and workplace training. In 1998 there were three WELL Programme projects which targeted outworkers. 
</para><para>The Australian Light Manufacturing Industry Training Advisory Board (ALMITAB) conducted a project which aimed to map existing outworker vocational education and training, map various models of training, collate existing learner resources, identify gaps in the training and make recommendations for future outwork training. The project resulted in three documents:</para><para>.	<inline font-style="italic">No Sweat: A report on Outworker Vocational Education and Training;</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">.	 Catalogue of Outworker Training; </inline> and</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">.	  A Guide on Best Practice in Outworker Training.</inline></para><para>The TCFUA (Victorian Branch) project was a continuation of the TCFUA projects funded by the WELL Programme in 1996 and 1997. In 1998 the TCF Homeworker Education Program conducted three classes at Springvale and St Albans targeting 60 outworkers.</para><para>The Adelaide Institute of TAFE Workplace Education Service project is a continuation of projects funded by the WELL Programme since 1996. It was directed at outworkers, who were almost exclusively women from South East Asia and who had low levels of literacy and English language skills. Twenty-two workers took part in courses to improve their language and literacy skills. A major part of the project involved networking and liaison with communities and organisations involved with outworkers so as to raise awareness among outworkers on accessing language, literacy and numeracy training.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Taxation compliance issues</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.54	 The committee is pleased that the Reportable Payments System is having an impact on reducing non-compliance with taxation laws in the clothing industry. However, the committee encourages the Government to continue to develop ways to assist and encourage outworkers to become part of the legal system without reprisals for past non-compliance.</inline></para><para>Noted. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has continued its campaign against tax avoidance in the TCF industries. In the 1998-99 financial year 87 officers have been committed to this task. Strategies are primarily aimed at tackling those people who are able to use `shell' entities. Typically, those people position themselves as `middle men' and are able to recruit and exploit outworker labour.</para><para>ATO work with community representatives indicates that generally outworkers would prefer to be able to participate in the industry and meet their tax obligations, as well as receive reasonable pay and work reasonable hours. Community-based organisations have had some success in developing alternative industry arrangements that promote the benefits of legal participation in the industry. These arrange 
 ments have the added advantage of by-passing the `middle men' in the industry who are often involved in cheque-laundering activities.</para><para>The Reportable Payments System (RPS) and cheque-laundering enforcement activities play an important role in achieving and maintaining compliance. For the 1997-98 financial year the ATO achieved an increase of 12 per cent in income tax returns lodged in the TCF industries over the figure for the preceding year. Total business income returned for the period increased by 2.5 per cent.</para><para>The Government has proposed that the RPS be replaced with a comprehensive pay as you go (PAYG) system supported by an Australian Business Number (ABN). These proposals offer opportunities to improve compliance in the TCF industries, including the possible application of a simple reporting system as described in the Government's `A New Tax System' document (p.146).</para><para>The ATO will continue to encourage individual outworkers to voluntarily come forward and participate in the tax system.

The Committee advised that there were a number of important matters of continuing concern with these instruments. The Committee can now report that it has pursued the matter and has received assurances from the Minister which it considers acceptable.</para><para>The Committee's concerns related to what appeared to be an invalid subdelegation to officials of legislative powers to open or close considerable areas of the Great Barrier Reef to fishing, including recreational fishing and spearfishing, for periods of up to five years. These powers were to be exercised by instruments which were not even subject to tabling, much less to possible disallowance. In reply to the Committee's query the Minister provided advice from the Office of Legislative Drafting (OLD) in the Attorney-General's Department (AGD) that if the powers were legislative then they "certainly" should be provided directly by the Zoning Plans and thus be subject to full parliamentary control. The OLD advised, however, that the powers were in fact administrative and therefore valid.</para><para>The Committee reported that it was startled by this advice, which appeared to fly in the face of what it understood to be the difference between legislative and administrative powers. The Committee then asked the Minister for advice on the matter from the Office of General Counsel (OGC) in the AGD. The OGC advice, which accorded with the views of the Committee, was that the powers in question were "clearly" of a legislative nature. The OGC advice did not refer to the earlier advice from OLD. The Committee then suggested to the Minister that the Zoning Plans should be remade as soon as possible to correct the present unsatisfactory position.</para><para>The Minister responded to the Committee by providing further advice from the OGC that the powers, although legislative, would be likely to 
 survive a court challenge to their validity on the grounds of subdelegation. The Committee replied that it did not accept this advice but that in any event it was a breach of parliamentary propriety to make legislative instruments which are not subject to tabling and disallowance. This was where the matter stood at 30 June 1998 when the Committee previously reported to the Senate on the Zoning Plans.</para><para>Since then the Committee has actively continued its scrutiny and, as noted above, has achieved what it regards as a satisfactory outcome. The Committee first wrote directly to the Attorney-General for more detailed advice on aspects of the legal position, with particular emphasis on the implications for the operation of the Legislative Instruments Bill. In this latter context the Committee wanted to be quite sure that the provisions of that Bill, if enacted, would apply to the instruments for which the Zoning Plans provided. The resulting opinion from the Chief General Counsel, Australian Government Solicitor, reviewed all the previous advice from the different areas of AGD and concluded that the provisions in question should be properly regarded as legislative. The Chief General Counsel also concluded, however, that the subdelegation of legislative power was not invalid. Nevertheless, the Chief General Counsel noted that, even if valid, there may be quite proper policy issues as to whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confer the delegated power. The Attorney-General advised that, in relation to the Legislative Instruments Bill, this latest advice would be drawn to the attention of the relevant officers.</para><para>Following this reply the Committee again wrote to the Minister asking that the decisions under the Zoning Plans be made subject to disallowance. The letter reads as follows:</para><para>2 December 1998</para><para>Senator the Hon Robert Hill</para><para>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA  ACT  2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the three Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan Amendments about which the Committee has previously written to you.</para><para>As I mentioned in my letter of 30 June 1998 the Committee wrote to the Attorney-General about the Amendments and has now received an opinion of 24 August 1998 (attached) from the Chief General Counsel which confirms the view of the Committee and which indeed confirms earlier advice from the Office of General Counsel of 19 October 1997 and 16 January 1998 that the instruments are legislative. This is in contrast 
 to earlier advice from the Office of Legislative Drafting of 2 and 5 December 1996 that the instruments are administrative.</para><para>The Chief General Counsel remains of the view, however, that although legislative the instruments are not invalid. The Committee does not accept this view, but whether or not the powers in the instruments are void it is a clear breach of parliamentary authority that such significant legislative instruments are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny and possible disallowance. On 30 June 1998 on behalf of the Committee I made a special statement to the Senate to this effect. I also draw your attention to the comments in the final paragraph of the opinion of the Chief General Counsel, viz. "Of course, even if the delegation is valid, there may be quite proper policy issues as to whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances to confer the delegated power on the authority."  The Committee endorses this view and would appreciate your advice that amendments will be made to make the exercise of the powers subject to parliamentary disallowance. The present position is deficient in relation to transparency, accountability, sound public administration and parliamentary propriety.</para><para>The Attorney-General has advised that the OLD opinions of 2 and 5 December 1996 are subject to client privilege but that he had passed our request for copies of the opinions to the Authority. The Committee understands that the Authority would prefer a formal request from the Committee before the opinions are released and I now make such a request. The Committee notes, however, advice from the Attorney-General that the latest opinion from the Chief General Counsel will be drawn to the attention of relevant officers in your portfolio. The Committee would welcome your advice that if any of your portfolio areas have previously advised any person that these matters are administrative decisions then that advice will be formally withdrawn in favour of advice that they are legislative. In any event the Committee assumes that you have been doing this since October 1997.</para><para>In particular and importantly the Committee understands that there may be matters of litigation, grievance or dispute about the exercise of the powers. Here also the Committee would appreciate your assurance that your portfolio areas have clearly informed everyone affected that it has been the formal position of the Commonwealth since October 1997 that the powers are legislative and not administrative. It should be indicated to such people that they could argue that the powers are void. It would be a serious matter if any people affected or aggrieved about the exercise of the powers were 
 not clearly informed by your officials of the official Commonwealth position.</para><para>Because of the importance of these matters the Committee would be grateful for an early reply.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Bill O'Chee</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold"></inline> Chairman</para><para>Almost five months later, despite having asked for an early reply and despite reminders from the Committee staff, the Committee had not received a reply. It therefore decided that it would be helpful to discuss the matter with the Minister and Senator O'Chee and Senator Coonan did this on 29 April 1999. The Minister generously gave the Committee members as much time as they needed to state their case and in turn clarified aspects of his position. The Minister advised that the present round of closures and openings on the Reef was complete and that it was not intended to make any more until the end of the existing experimental period in 2001. However, any future determinations made after that date would be included in Zoning Plans which are subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and control. A subsequent Committee meeting agreed that this was a satisfactory outcome in all the circumstances. The Committee is therefore able to report to the Senate that all future activity in this important and sensitive area of protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will accord with parliamentary propriety.</para><para>The Committee is grateful to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, for his personal attention to its concerns.</para><para>Bill O'Chee</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bill O'Chee</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Special statement on ministerial undertakings</inline></para><para>One of the most important elements of the operations of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is the practice of accepting undertakings from Ministers to amend or to take other action in relation to legislative instruments about which the Committee has concerns. The Committee accepts such undertakings even though amendment will take place in the future, in order to ensure that the implementation of policy and day to day administration of programs continues smoothly. When it accepts such undertakings the Committee withdraws any protective notice of disallowance which it has placed on the instrument, or refrains from giving a notice if it has not already done so. The Committee therefore relies on the good faith of Ministers to implement promptly any undertakings.  
</para><para>Prompt and timely implementation of undertakings is central to the success of the practice which the Committee has adopted. Failure to honour this principle could constitute a breach of parliamentary propriety and a breach of ministerial ethics. It is also deplorable because delay in implementation means that legislative instruments not only identified by the Committee but also accepted by the Minister as defective in relation to parliamentary propriety or personal rights, continue to be in effect and presumably be administered to the detriment of public life and to those people affected by the deficient instruments.</para><para>The Committee records and monitors the progress of ministerial undertakings and each Annual Report describes undertakings implemented during the reporting period and those which are still outstanding. Also, due to the efforts of the Committee, Explanatory Statements for instruments which implement undertakings advise of that fact. The Annual Report 1997-98 listed 87 instruments in relation to which undertakings had been implemented or were still outstanding. Unfortunately 42 of these were still outstanding and the Committee decided to take further action.</para><para>The Committee accordingly wrote to every Minister in whose portfolio responsibility there were outstanding undertakings, asking for reasons why the undertaking has not been implemented and for advice on when this would be done. The letter also asked for the date on which the portfolio agency had issued drafting instructions for the required amendments. The letter indicated that in the absence of a satisfactory explanation for delay the Committee intended to ask suitably senior agency officers to appear before it to explain the position in detail. The Committee asked if the matter could be given a high priority for attention.</para><para>The Committee can now report that it has received replies from Ministers which indicate that virtually all of the undertakings have been implemented, or that drafting of amending instruments has been completed or drafting instructions issued. This was pleasing, particularly because sometimes undertakings are qualified by saying that they will be implemented when the principal instrument is next amended. In several other cases a review of the program or an amendment of the enabling Act or the instrument had resulted in the concerns of the Committee not being met. In cases where a review was still in progress or was about to be initiated the Minister usually expressly assured the Committee that its concerns would be accommodated. In one case the Committee was advised that regulations had not been implemented due to an oversight, but that this would be rectified as soon as possible. Overall, the replies from Ministers demonstrated an awareness of the importance of an undertaking 
 given to the Committee and of its prompt implementation.</para><para>The replies did, however, reveal one matter that was not satisfactory. In this case regulations gave an agency the power to decide subjectively which matters were relevant to arbitration of a dispute, and then to take them into account when making a determination. This provision was in contrast to two other provisions where the agency was either bound or permitted to take account of matters which are objectively relevant to the issue. In reply to the Committee's query, the Minister advised that the regulations would be amended at the next available opportunity to make them consistent. The Committee assumed that this meant that the power would be made objective, but it appears that the Minister meant that another of the powers would be made subjective. The Committee is pursuing this matter.</para><para>In two cases the Minister advised that, although undertakings had not yet been implemented by formal amendment, administrative action had been taken to meet the Committee's concerns pending amendment of the respective instruments. In each of these cases this was a less than satisfactory response because the deficiencies in question involved personal rights, which is an area where problems noted by the Committee should be addressed as soon as possible. One of the cases involved a lack of mandatory notice of safeguards for administrative penalties imposed by public officials, which the Minister advised was remedied by a detailed information sheet attached to infringement notices. The other case, which was particularly relevant in the light of recent discussion of the international organisation of the Olympic Games, concerned the <inline font-weight="bold">Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations</inline>  made expressly to enable the Agency to provide leadership in the fight against the use of prohibited drugs in sport up to and beyond the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Here, following inquiries by the Committee, administrative action was taken to protect the rights of intellectually disabled athletes and of commercial companies dealing with the Agency. In both the present cases drafting instructions have now been issued.</para><para>In a number of cases Ministers had given an undertaking to amend the enabling or some other Act to meet the Committee's concerns. In one such case the required amendments had been passed by the House of Representatives but were still being considered by the Senate and consideration of another had reached an advanced stage with drafting instructions to be issued shortly. In another case the Minister advised that a particular program did not proceed and an undertaking was inadvertently overlooked. However, the Minister had asked the agency for advice on the amendments to the Act necessary to meet the undertaking and would 
 advise the Committee when this was received. In two other cases the undertaking had been delayed due to the need to amend the enabling Act before implementation could be progressed.</para><para>Other undertakings were affected by changes in the enabling Act. In two cases the Minister advised that amendments of the enabling Act resulted in the particular undertakings becoming unnecessary because the relevant legislative provisions had been superseded. In another case the Minister advised that extensive amendments of the Act following a major review had delayed implementation of undertakings, although draft amendments of the required regulations had now been received. In another similar case the Minister advised that amendments of regulations which had now been finalised had been delayed by the commencement of amendments of the Act.</para><para>One particularly important area for the Committee to monitor is undertakings relating to national uniform legislative schemes. There are presently four separate undertakings outstanding to amend regulations made under the road transport reform national scheme, which provided for model laws which would then be enacted by all the States and Territories. The legislation also provided for a Ministerial Council which had to approve model laws and any amendment of them. The different Acts which set the broad framework of the scheme did not themselves include any substantive provisions regulating vehicles or traffic, but instead provided for this to be done by regulation. The Committee considered the regulations comprising the different modules of the scheme and over a two year period received undertakings to amend to remove strict liability offences, to provide for AAT review and to improve safeguards for administrative penalties. The Minister also advised that the regulations would not commence before the amendments were made. The Committee reported in detail on these undertakings on 19 September 1995, Senate Hansard p.976, and 12 March 1998, Senate Hansard p.892.</para><para>The Minister has now advised that amendments have been drafted in relation to two of the four sets of regulations although final clearance still has to be obtained from the Australian Transport Council and all of the State and Territory governments. However, this was acceptable in light of the Minister's assurance that the original regulations would not commence until amendments had met the Committee's concerns. The Minister also advised that it is unlikely that the other two will commence because a review was about to be initiated. The National Road Transport Commission has advised, however, that any revised regulations will take into account the concerns of the Committee.  
</para><para>There are a few matters arising out of this exercise which require further action, but in general the Committee can report that the position in relation to implementation of undertakings given to the Committee is broadly acceptable. The Committee intends to continue to monitor closely compliance with undertakings.</para><para>Bill O'Chee</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline></para><para>Regulation Impact Statements</para><para>Senator Bill O'Chee</para><para>Chairman, Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>On 31 March 1999 the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, Mr Gary Banks; the head of the Office of Regulation Review (ORR), Dr Robyn Sheen; and Ms Sue Holmes, an official of the ORR, met with the Committee to discuss matters of mutual interest. The meeting followed the tabling on 10 December 1998 of the Productivity Commission's report <inline font-style="italic">Regulation and its Review 1997-98</inline> .</para><para>The report was the first comprehensive statement on compliance with regulation review requirements, implementing the Productivity Commissioner's obligation to report annually on the Commonwealth's new, best practice procedures for making regulations. A core element of these requirements is the preparation of Regulation Impact Statements (RIS), which are intended to ensure that regulatory action is well informed and meets intended goals, while minimising any adverse effects on business and the community. The RIS requirements apply not only to regulations, but also to Bills, treaties and quasi-legislation.</para><para>The ORR, located within the Productivity Commission, has a central role in achieving the implementation of these initiatives. The two most important priorities of the ORR are to advise Commonwealth agencies on quality control mechanisms for regulatory proposals and for the review of existing regulations; and to examine all RIS prepared by agencies and advise on whether they provide an adequate level of analysis and meet the new requirements.</para><para>The establishment of RIS requirements has been one of the most significant recent developments in quality control of legislative instruments. At the State and Territory level this has generally been imposed by Act, whereas at the Commonwealth level it has been implemented by administrative direction, although the various editions of the Legislative Instruments Bill have included provisions for RIS. The elements of a RIS may vary between jurisdictions but typically they include:</para><para>an outline of the problem or issues which need action 
</para><para>the desired objectives of any action</para><para>.	 the different alternative options, including non-regulatory options, by which the desired objectives may be achieved</para><para>.	 an assessment of the impact, costs and benefits for business, government, consumers, and the community of each option</para><para>.	 mandatory consultation with the public and interest groups</para><para>.	 a recommended option</para><para>.	 a strategy to implement and review the preferred option</para><para>The Commonwealth RIS requirements were consolidated in <inline font-style="italic">A Guide to Regulation</inline> , published by the ORR, which was endorsed by the Government in September 1997. Since then the Committee has scrutinised the RIS, which are tabled, in addition to the Explanatory Statement, with all legislative instruments affecting business or competition.</para><para>The Committee has found the RIS to be of considerable assistance in its scrutiny of legislative instruments, despite the Committee having different priorities to the ORR. The Committee scrutinises delegated legislation to ensure compliance with high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety, whereas the ORR responsibilities are for the most effective and efficient regulations from an economy-wide perspective. These different objectives are by no means the same, but they are complementary and RIS have enhanced the ability of the Committee to carry out its functions.</para><para>The Committee has found RIS to be particularly useful because they are more detailed and thorough than Explanatory Statements in their background information. Also, RIS are structured in such a way that may reveal areas of especial concern to the Committee. For instance, every RIS must identify a problem which needs to be addressed and these problems are often set out with admirable frankness not usually seen in Explanatory Statements. These problems have included deficiencies in personal rights which have not been remedied for inappropriate lengths of time, or questions about validity which similarly have been left to continue for lengthy periods. The other parts of the RIS may similarly disclose difficulties about which the Committee will require further information from the Minister. This is not to say that RIS should displace Explanatory Statements, because the two emphasise different matters. Explanatory Statements are weighted towards the legal authority for the instrument and the provisions of individual clauses. The RIS, on the other hand, are weighted towards the goals of the instrument in the context of the competitiveness of business and the productivity of the economy. 
</para><para>The Committee closely scrutinises Explanatory Statements for deficiencies either in quality or quantity, taking the position that any such defects are breaches of parliamentary propriety. This view is emphasised by the fact that Ministers usually sign or initial tabled Explanatory Statements for regulations. Every year the Committee writes to Ministers about problems with Explanatory Statements. Sometimes these defects, although significant, are straightforward, with the Explanatory Statement simply not explaining or stating anything of value. Sometimes, however, the question is more serious. For instance, the Explanatory Statement for one set of regulations did not advise whether a statutory requirement to consult the Privacy Commissioner had been followed and, if so, what was the result of that consultation. Following inquiries by the Committee it was revealed that the Privacy Commissioner had indeed been consulted, but that his advice was overruled. The Committee then took action to have the Federal Executive Council Handbook amended to provide that such matters must be included, see the Committee's<inline font-style="italic"> Annual Report 1996-97</inline>  p.73 and 81. The Committee also presented a paper to an Administrative Law and Ethics conference suggesting that there were questions about the ethical standards of the officers of the Department who had carriage of this matter, see the Committee's<inline font-style="italic"> Annual Report 1997-98</inline> , p.99.</para><para>The position is, however, different in relation to RIS. While the Committee carefully reads all RIS and, as noted previously, finds many instances of possible breaches of its principles, it does not scrutinise the actual processes in the making of a RIS or the adequacy of the RIS in complying with the administrative guidelines. The reason for this is that the development of a RIS is essentially a policy development process and the Committee always stays clear of policy matters. The success of the Committee in its core function of scrutiny of legislative instruments is due to the fact that Ministers know that it operates in a non-partisan fashion and does not question policy. The Committee finds RIS to be a valuable source of information, but it is not appropriate for it to become involved in policy development. The ORR is a specialist agency with the mandate to oversee the entire RIS process and liaison with the ORR along the lines of our recent meeting with the Chairman of the Productivity Commission and the head of the ORR will enable the Committee to be aware of any relevant developments. Also, the Senate legislation committees would scrutinise RIS in the course of their work. For these reasons, the Committee would be reluctant to become involved in arguments about the adequacy of RIS or other merits based issues.</para><para>There are several other areas where RIS are of particular value to the Committee. For instance, the scrutiny of national uniform legislative schemes presents special challenges for legislation scrutiny 
 committees, see <inline font-style="italic">Annual Reports 1995-96, p.56 </inline> and <inline font-style="italic">1997-98, p.83</inline> . It is therefore encouraging that the Council of Australian Governments now has a mandatory requirement that new or amending regulations which are made by Ministerial Councils or national standard setting bodies are to have a RIS and comply with the Competition Principles Agreement. These requirements parallel these at the purely Commonwealth level and are supervised by the Committee on Regulatory Reform. As discussed in the special statements made to the Senate, the scrutiny of national schemes is difficult because of the tendency for Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers to reply to concerns of scrutiny committees by saying that the schemes are the result of agreements between governments which cannot be changed. This has not affected unduly the operation of the Committee, which has accepted significant undertakings from Ministers to amend national scheme regulations and not to implement these provisions unless the changes were agreed to by the other Ministers. Nevertheless it is a concern.</para><para>The introduction of RIS for national uniform regulations is beneficial for the same reasons as for Commonwealth regulations. The RIS enable the Committee to have a much broader perspective on the background of uniform regulations, which will often be more complex than for legislation solely at the Commonwealth level. This may lead the Committee to issues relating to parliamentary propriety or personal rights which it may have missed if it had to rely solely on the Explanatory Statement. As with other RIS, the RIS here are usually quite candid in their comments on the development of regulations and these can be a useful source of inquiry.</para><para>Another function of the ORR is to supervise the national Legislative Review Program, which, like the RIS requirements, was established by administrative rather than legislative means. Along with the RIS, review and staged repeal is an important element in improving the standard of delegated legislation. Legislative requirements for this usually include the exotically named backcapturing and sunset provisions. The quantitative control of legislative instruments is important as well as the qualitative and this is another aspect of interest to the Committee.</para><para>Finally, the requirements for RIS, Explanatory Statements and staged repeal may change if the Legislative Instruments Bill is reintroduced and is enacted. Different versions of the Bill, first introduced almost five years ago, included provisions on these matters, but these should not change the functions of the ORR.

The President referred the letters to the committee as submissions under privilege resolution No. 5.

They are, of course, matters that have been canvassed on other occasions in this chamber, although the letters themselves have never actually been given to me to allow a proper consideration of the content. I thank Senator Ray for his tabling of this report on behalf of the Privileges Committee. I think the committee has done the Senate a great service in that it does allow for an examination of the claims being made by a number of persons associated with the staffing of Greenwich University, one of Australia's newest universities, which we would all be aware was legally established by the Legislative Council of Norfolk Island. I think it is an important opportunity for us to examine these details, and I will endeavour to do so with greater consideration later on. Like Senator Ray, I am not in the business of perniciously or gratuitously insulting peopleâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âLike me.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âLike Senator Ray, I am of that view. I think the privileges of the parliament ought to be protected to allow the elected representatives of this country to speak about matters and to identify mistakes 
 that have been made by government. I think it is important that these conventions be maintained so as to allow us to exercise our responsibilities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have raised a number of concerns about the incompetence of this government in allowing a dodgy operation like this at Greenwich to ever get off the ground. I am particularly concerned, as are a number of other people in this country. I note, for instance, a letter I received from Mr Phil Honeywood, the Minister for Tertiary Education and Training in Victoria, who said:</para><para>As you have correctly pointed out, I have been very concerned about the lack of rigorous processes of review comparable to those carried out by the States, before the recognition of Greenwich University was given by the Parliament of Norfolk Island.</para><para>I have been campaigning to expose what are quite clearly ludicrous mistakes made by this government and made through the incredible ignorance of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government in his abysmal handling of his portfolio. I have been particularly concerned to expose attempts by a group of shysters to circumvent the regulatory framework that exists in Australia to protect our fourth largest export industry. The education industry is entirely dependent on the maintenance of our good name and the quality of Australian education.</para><para>Many people in this country are of the view that we do have a high quality education system. It is a view which I certainly support. We need to monitor that. We need to take all necessary measures to protect it. Australia is very vulnerable to the activities of a few people, given that we now have an industry worth some $3.1 billion. Australian citizens have a right to expect exactly the same level of support that US governmentsâstate and federalâoffer their citizens insofar as their concerns have been expressed. The Californian state authorities recently indicated that diploma mills manufacturing degrees based on the ability to write a cheque rather than master a curriculum will no longer be allowed to continue. That statement was put to us as a result of questions that I raised concerning these particular matters and relating to issues associated with some of the individuals who have been named.</para><para>The establishment of Greenwich University under Australian legislation, courtesy of the Norfolk Island parliament, has been greeted with widespread dismay and disbelief throughout the higher education world. International cyberspace has resounded with jokes about the way in which Australia has endured one of the biggest bureaucratic bungles in recent decades, not to mention the gullibility of the good citizens of Norfolk Island and of our own federal minister for territories and his department. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is also implicated in this affair.</para><para>I raised these matters in the chamber back in March. Since that time, a number of others have also raised concerns, including vice-chancellors and state ministers for education. As a consequence, this government has been obliged to establish an inquiry into this fiasco. It has been forced to inquire into the bona fides of this institutionâan institution which has not been accredited in the United States and which has made numerous attempts to get into Australia through a number of backdoor means. It has finally used the venue of Norfolk Island to achieve its objective.</para><para>It is an American import, an American interloper. It is a clear example of the great diversity in the higher education system in the United States. For example, America has some of the finest universities in the world, but it also has what might best be described as degree mills or vanity universities. However, in Australia there is a wide-ranging understanding that Australia produces top quality education. In Australia in recent times there has been a series of non-traditional areas of learning. I do not think it is appropriate that we should in any way prevent the development of non-traditional areas of learning; however, we need to ensure that quality is protected.</para><para>American society has a much broader understanding of what quality means. For instance, a whole lot of new ideas are uncritically accepted in the United States. There is a huge range of beliefs and ideas which we might not regard as being founded on empirical research or rigorous intellectual data. America might be the land of the free but it 
 is also the land of Waco and the tragic Branch Davidian cult. America is a land where an astonishing 40 per cent of undergraduate science students believe in creationism, not evolution. They believe that the world was created only a few thousand years ago and they believe that `false' evidence, such as dinosaurs and fossils, was placed there as a trick by Satan. Some 15 per cent of Americans believe they have personally been abducted by aliens.</para><para>The academics who provided information to the committee were concerned that I did not know the full facts. Maybe I should examine some of the full facts. For instance, I see in this report of the Committee of Privilegesâwhich I have only just seenâthat a Mr Lindgren said:</para><para>Senator Carr also felt obliged to make a derogative remark regarding an Orthodox Order to which I belong. This order in fact possesses members of the Romanoff family, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and is protected (patron) by His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. Regarding this I think it was best summed up by a member of the Romanov family, who recently, stated: "I have never been attacked by a member of my own Class" . . . Enough said?</para><para>What an extraordinary defence! He continues:</para><para>Mr. Carr, once again true to his intent ignored my association in the Brotherhood of the Blessed Gerard which is a service branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Catholic) and my internationally recognised Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Ignatius of Antioch (under His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Ignace Anthony II Hayeck, Uniate-Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch).</para><para>Of course I did not go to all the detail.

Box 19527</para><para>Colorado City 81019</para><para>To whom this may concern:</para><para>I read the minutes from Australia's senate meeting on March 22nd 1999, and I have a few reactions. First, I must thank Senator Carr for indulging so brilliantly in insults, for this frees me to be rather direct myself. Though I don t think I'll be needing words such as shysters' to be effective.</para><para>By snickering at the concepts of Alchemy or analysis of Fairytale, Senator Carr is advertising his ignorance of a whole field of psychology, namely depth Psychology. So though Carl Jung does not need defending, Senator Carr needs informing. 
</para><para>The work of Carl Jung (a Swiss Psychiatrist, 1875-1961) consists of a 20 volume collection of his research spreading well over 50 years (1902-1960), and continued since then by scholars all over the world. This research includes the translation of Old Greek, Arabic and later European texts of alchemy, fairytales and mythology dug up from the dung heap of the past. Jung carried out a comparison of the behavioural patterns revealed in these texts with those found in contemporary mythology and shamanic traditions (he travelled to India, Africa and visited native American nations to meet with medicine people in person), as well as contemporary themes in literature, art, and films, as well as in the dreams of his psychiatric patients.</para><para>Secondly, his findings made Carl Jung the father of concepts such as Extroversion/Introversion, the Collective Unconscious, and archetypal forces behind behaviour. The Collected Works have been translated in at least seven languages. He is being studied in Europe, England, the United States, Canada. South Africa, South America, and is certainly known by several Australian authors.</para><para>Originally, Jung Institutes across Europe and the USA were strictly postdoctoral programs. Since the 1980's, more universities became interested in making available a course of study that, up to this point, was very elitist and hardly accessible to anyone who was not considered "analytical material". There are now Jung Institutes in every major cities of the United States, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, and they also include programs for the layman. Some universities have devoted entire programs to the study and application as well as augmentation of Jung's thought. The best known such university if the Pacifica Institute in California, an accredited university which holds the library of Joseph Campbell's original works.</para><para>Anyone who has information about Carl Jung's work knows that, rather than "doctrinal", it is open and expansive, and subject to continuing deeper exploration. In fact its great beauty resides in the fact that it identified patterns of behaviour seated deep in the unconscious that are common to all people. This offers academics new tools with which to study human behaviour across time and cultures. Jung's findings reveal the existence of timeless interpretations of reality that are surprisingly close to contemporary quantum mechanics' or new physics' discoveries. In that sense Jung was at the vanguard of a movement towards greater unity in the world, a braking of ethnocentric barriers that are at the source of most wars, and a tool for communication among humans that bypasses local cultural boundaries. It is sad to see that, once again, an effort to apply these ideas by a brave new world (in this case, a Hawaiian university joining with an Australian university) is being attacked by outdated ethnocentric provincialism. 
</para><para>In any case, I hope that this information will be useful in warning Senator Carr that, next time he plans to endeavour in the smashing of an entire body of academic studies, he better do his homework first, for surely he didn't intend to demonstrate his ignorance to the whole world.</para><para>Sincerely,</para><para>(signed)</para><para>Claudine Jeanrenaud, Ph.D.</para><para>Educational Consultants of Mississippi</para><para>Est. 1981</para><para>Director: C. E. Lindgren, EdS</para><para>Dear Sirs:</para><para>Let me say that I am honoured that Senator Carr would have so little to do as to reflect on my name and my achievements. I fear, however, that the Senator was either ignorant or perhaps selective in his remarks toward me. I felt that rather than ignore his remarks as being those of at best a misinformed individual I should address his comments not in the ignoble manner in which they were stated but as an educator, scholar and gentlemen.</para><para>Senator Carr in referring to my masters felt obliged to ignore my BAE, Med, and EdS from the University of Mississippi "The University is a centre for Faulkner studies, offering one of the finest collections of the Nobel Prize winners work and maintaining his Rowan Oak home as a literary shrine. The	 Medical Centre surgeons performed the world's first lung (1963) and heart (1964) transplants in man, and its physiologists defined the role of the kidneys in controlling blood pressure. Medical Centre faculty also have constructed the world's most comprehensive computer model of the body, and the campus has been selected as one of five national sites to test GE's new twin magnet MRT (magnetic resonance therapy). Today, faculty, staff, and students are pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, imagination, and expertise necessary for a productive life in an increasingly complex society and competitive world. They play a significant role in the country's research efforts through federally funded facilities on the Oxford campus such as the Jamie Whitten National Centre for Physical Acoustics, the National Centre for the Development of Natural Products, the National Food Service Management Institute, the Marine Minerals Technology Centre, the Centre for Water and Wetlands Resources, and the Centre for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering.</para><para>The University also plays a crucial role in Mississippi by preparing students for leadership in the state and nation. Distinguished law school alumni include nine governors, seven lieutenant 
 governors, 29 Mississippi Supreme Court justices, 12 U.S. representatives, and four U.S. senators.</para><para>Senator Carr also felt it necessary to ignore my FCP (eg. MPhil) from the world famous College of Preceptors in Essex, England and my soon to be completed (June 1999) DEd from UNISA in Pretoria.</para><para>While denouncing some of the societies to which I am proudly associated, Mr. Carr once again showed his true intent by not mentioning the Royal Historical Society (London), American Academy of Religion, Medieval Academy of America, and Orders and Medals Society of America.

The Vatican also recognises this order. Finally in passing, I feel it necessary to provide once again insight into Senator Carr's lack of knowledge concerning myself or my achievements. He felt it necessary to mention the Order of the King's Daughters and Sons that I believe he must have through ignorance felt was a fake chivalric order. If he had only taken 5 minutes to either look the order up on the Internet or in some reference he would have discovered that "The King's Daughters and Sons was founded on January 13, 1886 by Margaret Bottome of New York City, with a membership of ten women. It is a unit of interdenominational Christians dedicated to the development of spiritual life and the stimulation of Christian activities. Through a three-fold program of religion, education, and philanthropy, the organisation trains its members as well as others for Christian Service. Today, its thirty nine branches throughout the United States and Canada support ministries for the aging, handicapped and the underprivileged. The Order has an Indian department that encourages contributions to Native Americans, supports leprosy research, and contributes to American and Foreign Bible Societies. It 
 owns and operates three houses at the Chautauqua Institution in New York and provides scholarships for over forty students for summer courses there."

Perhaps the esteemed Senator from Australia does not know the scientific basis for all of Medical Science. Medicine in the last half of the twentieth century has emphasized the principles of biochemistry and the physical principles of surgery to assist in healing. Biochemistry is one aspect of life energy; electricity is the other. Every cellular function is both electrical and chemical at the same time. Neither can work alone. The field of Energy Medicine addresses this interface, exploring the dimensions of physiology, chemical and electrical activities, of life and the multiple influences of external and internal control of physiology, and therefore, of health and disease. Thus, all research done in support of graduate degrees in Energy Medicine must withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny and be of publishable quality, suitable for the scientific journals and of benefit to medical science.</para><para>Science recognizes as energy only the principles embodied in light and sound. However, in every culture throughout history there has been a constant that Life Energy, indeed cosmic or Divine Energy, may transcend our fourth dimensional concepts of light and sound, electricity and electromagnetism. Certainly bioenergy is widely discussed from a philosophical point of view. Energy Medicine considers the very broad field from Divine Energy and Spiritual Energy, as well as the most subtle effects of the electromagnetic realm. Robert Becker has considered bioenergy to be bioelectromagnetic to include all known and theoretical aspects of Life Energy. This obviously includes the mind and all influences upon the body, mind and emotions.</para><para>In the last 20 years, the field of psychoneuroimmunology has demonstrated many of the subtle effects of mind upon a wide variety of neurological, endocrinological, physiological and immunological functions. During this same time, the 
 concept of Holistic Medicine has evolved to include complementary, alternative, and Energy Medicine. It has now become quite clear that Energy Medicine will expand the science of psychoneuroimmunology, effectively contributing to one of the most important new fields in the past fifty years.</para><para>Students interested in Energy Medicine study the broad field of energy, learn practical and research applications of Energy Medicine, and focus intensely on one major subdivision of Energy Medicine. The broad fields include acupuncture, reflexology, kinesiology, homeopathy, color, sound and aroma therapy, psychospiritual aspects of healing, chakra energy centers, yoga, Tai Chi and physical exercise, biofeedback and autogenic training, self-regulation and relaxation, principles of nutrition and psychoneuroendorcine immunology, and intuition. The primary audience for the degrees in Energy Medicine will be the allied professionals, including all licensed and certified practitioners such as allopathic physicians, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, nurses, physical therapists, psychologists and counselors, massage therapists, and spiritual healers.</para><para>During this last decade it has become increasingly obvious that scientific medicine with its emphasis upon drugs and surgery has failed to address spirituality, as well as the specific needs of individuals with chronic disease, which often do not respond adequately to drugs or surgery. Several surveys in the United States and one in Canada indicate that a significant percentage of patients in any given year seek therapy from alternative medical practitioners. Techniques that such individuals choose range from acupuncture to relaxation therapy, nutritional counseling and supplements, manipulative therapy, homeopathy and all of the other therapies that make up the complete field of Energy Medicine. There are no medical schools or other known clinical training programs that provide a foundation for those interested in practical applications of Energy Medicine. The post-graduate degrees in Energy Medicine are designed to fill that need.</para><para>The energy Medicine Program at Greenwich University provides the core competencies, skills and knowledge required of the mid-career professional. Functional skills developed enable students to understand and make use of techniques such as: acupuncture, kinesiology, homeopathy, and biofeedback, and spiritual healing, color, sound, aroma, psychospiritual and relaxation therapies, therapeutic physical exercise for general health, nutritional principles for diagnosis and therapy, postural effects upon health, application of modern electrotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic application of medical intuition for the improvement of the quality of life, and clearing the blocks that interfere with vision, creativity and intuition. Greenwich graduates 
 will have the broad knowledge necessary to understand when specific tools should be applied, when referrals should be made to conventional physicians and practitioners, and they will have mastered one of the major fields of energy medicine in a way that they can apply it within their own profession.</para><para>I trust this discussion has clarified for you the importance of energy medicine as an essential field of study at the university level.</para><para>Sincerely</para><para>(signed)</para><para>C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D</para><para>Columbia</para><para>Evangelical Seminary</para><para>March 31, 1999</para><para>To the August Body of the Australian Senate</para><para>Regarding comments made by Senator Carr with regard to Greenwich University in general and Dr. Rick Walston in particular.</para><para>It is with deep disappointment that I note that the good Senator does not investigate into matters worthy of being presented to the Australian Senate I note with sadness that when he speaks of me, his only evidence is what he "has been told by another," as he indicates. Did Senator Carr speak to me personally?  Did he communicate with me by phone, mail, fax, or email?  Did he investigate the level of academic quality that our school requires? No, no and no.</para><para>Without so much as checking to see if those things said were true, he stood before your great body and told you that I was the president of a degree mill. I would think that such a charge should be made only after careful investigation and the accumulation of corroborating evidence. Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such "evidence": a charge that I shall prove later in this letter.</para><para>Presently, I shall point out one of our more recent doctoral graduates for evidence to the contrary: James R. White earned his <inline font-style="italic">Master of Theology </inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Doctor of Theology </inline> degrees from our school. Dr. White is the author of <inline font-style="italic">The King James Only Controversy </inline> (which was his Master's thesis for his master's degree with our school) and <inline font-style="italic">The Forgotten Trinity </inline> (which was his doctoral dissertation with our school). Dr. White's academic works with our school have been published by Bethany Publishing House, a national publisher, and his books (including at least four more than the two mentioned) are being used in other, accredited, schools as text books. Now I ask you, is it common for diploma mills to require such academic work that rises to the top of the publishing world and becomes text 
 books for other, fully accredited schools?  Obviously not.</para><para>And, then our most recent graduate is a woman named Elyn Schwartz. After transferring her credits to our school from other accredited universities, she had 32 credits remaining to earn her Bachelor of Religion with our school. She enrolled on May 25, 1995. She completed her 32 semester hours with our school on March 30, 1999. So, let me ask you another question, is it common for diploma mills to require such hard work as to lead a person through nearly four years of arduous study to complete 32 semester credits?  Obviously not.</para><para>Let me now shift to our faculty and mention that the idea that our school is a diploma mill would come as quite a shock to our faculty member <inline font-weight="bold">R. Brinley Jones</inline> , the President of the National Library of Wales, and Chairman of the Cathedrals and Churches Commission of Wales, and who holds his D.Phil. from Oxford University, U.K. His honorary degrees include the D.Litt. from Potchefstroom University, South Africa. And, it would also come as a shock to these other distinguished faculty members:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Samuel G.

Again, obviously not.</para><para>Let me point out the quality of recommendations that our school has gotten. Obviously Mr. Carr has his source, and I happen to know who is source is, and I also happen to know that his source is in the minority when it comes to issues academic. However, Dr. John Bear is the undisputed expert in non-traditional education. Dr. Bear's guide on distance learning education <inline font-style="italic">(Bears' Guide to Earning College Degrees Non-traditionally) </inline> has sold more than 300,000 copies. He also served as <inline font-style="italic">the </inline> diploma mill consultant to the FBI from 1979 to 1992. When the FBI brought diploma mill operators to justice in Federal Court, Dr. Bear appeared as the expert witness for the FBl. He has also worked with or been on the news shows <inline font-style="italic">60</inline><inline font-style="italic">Minutes, 20/20, 
 American Journal, and Inside Edition </inline> helping them in their efforts to expose diploma mills.</para><para>With that background, please read the letter of recommendation that Dr. Bear wrote for placement on our web page:</para><para>To whom it may concern:</para><para>My books on non-traditional higher education have sold more than 300,000 copies, and are widely regarded as the standard reference works in this field. For more than twenty years, I have been researching and writing about degree granting institutions, both accredited and unaccredited.</para><para>Some people argue, in effect, that if a school is not accredited, then it is a degree mill. This is nonsense. For one thing, every school is unaccredited when it begins. For another thing, there are schools which, by their very nature, are academically sound, legitimately and sincerely run, appropriately licensed, but unlikely ever to gain "traditional" accreditation because of the innovative or experimental or non-traditional nature of their programs. Some such schools succumb to the lure of the many unrecognised (and thus useless) accrediting associations (some of which will accredit anyone who pays the fee), and, thankfully, some like Columbia Evangelical Seminary do not succumb.</para><para>In evaluating an unaccredited school, the two crucial questions that must be asked are these: who are the people behind it (and what are their credentials), and what is the quality of work being asked of, and done by, the students. On both of these criteria, in my opinion, Columbia Evangelical Seminary looks good. Fortunately, this is something that can be independently verified. Look at the credentials of Dr. Walston and his colleagues. And look at the work of the students. If this is done fairly, I think most people would agree that Columbia Evangelical Seminary is true to its mission statement, and offers its students both an education and a credential of which they can be justly proud.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">- John B. Bear, Ph.D. (Michigan State University, 1966).</inline></para><para>Oh, by the way, it might also <inline font-style="italic">be of special interest </inline> to you that Dr. Bear is a contributor to the guide <inline font-style="italic">Country Education Profiles </inline> of the Australian National Office on Overseas Skills (NOOSR). Dr. John Bear wrote 15 of those 87 profiles, including the United States profile.</para><para>Yes, it is beginning to appear that the one who has "sneaked up on unsuspecting people" is Senator Carr. All of the information that I have given you above is public record.</para><para>Now concerning me in particular, Senator Carr notes that my Ph.D. comes from Greenwich University. This is true. I earned my Ph.D. with Greenwich University under the mentorship of 
 Stanley M. Horton, Th.D., renowned Assemblies of God theologian and author of about thirteen books. However, what Mr. Carr failed to mention is that I also hold a <inline font-style="italic">Bachelor of Arts </inline> degree, a <inline font-style="italic">Master of Religion </inline> degree, and a <inline font-style="italic">Doctor of Ministry </inline> degree all from <inline font-style="italic">accredited </inline> institutions here in America. Also, I am presently a Ph.D. student with Potchefstroom University of South Africa (a significant school founded in 1896).</para><para>My last point is to prove my charge above that " Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such `evidence.'"</para><para>How can I possibly prove that Mr. Carr simply repeated information "told" to him and that he did not investigate the charges himself? Simple: the name of our school has not been Faraston Theological Seminary for well over a year. For more than one full year, on all of our literature, on our web site, and in our advertisements, the name of our school has been Columbia Evangelical Seminary (Faraston being our former name). A very simple phone call to this office would have turned up such "deeply hidden" information. A quick stop at our world wide web page would have yielded this obvious information. If Mr. Carr had taken the time within the last 15 months to contact me, or even one of our faculty members, or just one of our students, he would have known better than to refer to our old, out-of-date name.</para><para>In conclusion, I cannot vouch for any other person that Mr. Carr so demonises in his speech; however, if he did comparable "research" on the others he mentioned, then I would certainly caution anyone from simply accepting his charges at face value.</para><para>Thank you for this opportunity to respond.</para><para>Sincerely,</para><para>(signed)</para><para>Rick Walston, B.A., M.Rel., Ph.D., D.Min</para><para>President of Columbia Evangelical Seminary</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SOME RESPONSES TO SENATOR CARR</inline></para><para>Greenwich University adopted the name Greenwich in 1989 as it desired a shorter name which was unique and had not been used before. Nearly 4 years later (when Greenwich University and its School of Theology had achieved a high level of recognition in  the United Kingdom) the Thames Polytechnic in Woolwich petitioned the Privy Council to allow itself to be known as Greenwich University. It was refused as there was already a respected Greenwich University (albeit American). It was allowed to rename itself as the University of Greenwich to avoid confusion with the established Greenwich University.</para><para>Greenwich was established in 1972 and was originally known as the International Institute for 
 Advanced Studies. Since its founding the name International Institute has been adopted in various guises by a number of schools around the world.</para><para>The International Institute for Advanced Studies still exists as a division of Greenwich and is still in good standing in the State of Missouri. Its headquarters are now on Norfolk Island.</para><para>The State of Missouri does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).</para><para>The State of Hawaii does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).</para><para>Accreditation in the U.S.A. is quite different from that in Australia. In the U.S. accreditation is a voluntary process undertaken after a university has been operating and awarding degrees for a number of years. It enables universities to receive federal funding. Greenwich does not receive government funding: it never has; it never will: it would return it if it was ever sent. Greenwich has been properly established in the U.S.A. since 1972. It has an excellent reputation.</para><para>There has never been any irregularity in any state or country.</para><para>It is no more a mail order school than the Australian National University in Canberra (which sent a Postgraduate Diploma in Law in the mail to the Chancellor of Greenwich University last year) or the University of Melbourne which also mails out degrees. (Both of these, like Greenwich, require that the students complete the course requirements beforehand.)</para><para>Greenwich has not been refused, nor did it apply, in Victoria. It has had a representative office in Victoria since 1990. Its registration was renewed for a further three years by the Victorian Government earlier this year.</para><para>Prior to the Greenwich University Act being passed the university requested both the Higher Education Division of DEETYA and the AQF (MCEETYA) if its courses  and curriculum could be submitted for evaluation and accreditation so it could have an external and independent assessment of its programmes. It was told quite clearly and firmly that the AQF and MCEETYA did not accredit courses or universities, and that the other universities resisted any form of external accreditation.</para><para>(These facts are known by Senator Carr, who has been supplied with documentation to that effect and  whose own electorate office is nearby to the AQF and MCEETYA).  Greenwich was told by DEETYA and the AQF that it would be self-accrediting and that there was no procedure for it to have its courses evaluated by the AQF or anyone else.</para><para>The Chancellor received all his degrees at accredited or state approved universities.  He has never met a Shoshone Indian. The American schools from 
 which he graduated were in California and Pennsylvaniaânot Nevada.</para><para>Its legislative establishment by way of a company and subsequent legislation is the same process as that used by Bond University. The Greenwich University Act is similar to that establishing Bond and Notre Dame.</para><para>There is no Brimeyer organization.</para><para>Prince Alexis (who died in January 1995) was the hereditary Head of the House of Anjou. He was a client of the Chancellor (a barrister at law) who acted for Prince Alexis and his family for a number of years.</para><para>The Chancellor is not an academic (although he has done some teaching many years ago, and has teaching qualifications including being a registered teacher in the State of Victoria).  He does not teach nor instruct nor write curriculum at Greenwich University.  He does not run Greenwich University.  Greenwich is a community of scholars run by the President, the Vice-President, the deans, the faculty and the graduates. The Chancellors position is an honorary one, and always has been. (Though one must say that if the Labour Opposition continues to use parliamentary privilege to defame in a cowardly and deceitful fashion university chancellors there will be very few people willing to accept such roles.)</para><para>If Senator Carr really believes what he said under parliamentary privilege then he should repeat his statements outside the Senate and in a public forum. This would then allow the university, its staff, its faculty, its students and its graduates take both individual and collective legal action in the courts of Australia, the United States of America and in the other countries of the world where the university  community is situated.</para><para>Dr John Walsh of Brannagh</para><para>Greenwich University</para><para>Taylors Road</para><para>Norfolk Island</para><para>South Pacific 2899</para><para>Australia</para><para>Fax Number (6723) 23547</para><para>Telephone (6723) 22834</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>6667</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interests Committee</title><page.no>6667</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report </title><page.no>6667</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>6667</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn accordance with the Senate resolution of 17 March 1994 about the declaration of senators' interests, I present a copy of the latest Register of Alterations to Senators'

However, I think it important to place on the record some brief comments on the report that I have just tabled on 
 the Australian Delegation to the 101st IPU Conference and also a bi-lateral visit to Norway.</para><para>Firstlyâthe IPU: As one of the two new continuing delegates to the IPU Council I found my first Conference, at first mystifying but by the end of the week very rewarding. Even with extensive oral and written briefs, the workings of the IPU are not easy to understand. Unperturbed, my colleagues and I confronted the challenge and I believe we made a significant contribution on behalf of this Parliament. The report presents in detail the work of the IPU and highlights the individual contribution made by each of the Australian delegates. In this regard, I would commend to the Senate the meeting of the Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew and Senator Jacinta Collins with the Yugoslav delegation at which he made the strongest possible representations for the release of the Australian aid workers being detained in that country.</para><para>I was pleased to participate in the IPU debate on:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary action to encourage all countries to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty prohibiting all nuclear testing, to encourage universal and non-discriminatory nuclear non-proliferation measures and to work towards the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons</inline> .</para><para>and was appointed to the drafting committee that is charged with the responsibility of preparing a final resolution for adoption by the IPU as a whole. I was then privileged to be elected President of that drafting committeeâthis was a formidable task that required over five hours of negotiation between the nine members of the drafting committee in order to finalise the draft.. I was most gratified when this resolution, with some minor amendments, was adopted by the overwhelming majority of the plenary session of the IPU.</para><para>Secondlyâto Norway</para><para>Bi-lateral visits give parliamentarians a unique opportunity to appreciate different political systems, cultures and societies, as well as meeting a diverse range of interesting people.</para><para>In Norway, the Delegation was honoured to meet with</para><para>.	 The Prime Minister;</para><para>.	 The Minister for Foreign Affairs;</para><para>.	 Presiding officers of the Norwegian Storting and members of the Norwegian parliament; and</para><para>.	 Representatives of business and industry.</para><para>The Delegation's report records in detail these meetings and the extent to which aims and objectives of the visit were met.</para><para>Although meetings of this type are important and let me say the visit was highly successful, there are 
 other special occasions that characterise the visit and remain with you.</para><para>I well remember the Delegation, having travelled by bus and ferry through a snow-covered landscape, meeting with Mr Ole Oskal, his mother, his wife and children. We sat cross-legged on sticks around the perimeter of a Sami tent, with a warming fire in the centre, sipping reindeer soup, discussing indigenous affairs, the Sami people and traditional culture and lifestyle. As Senator Collins will attest I failed miserably in my attempts to lasso a reindeer, notwithstanding that it was tethered to a pole six feet away from me.</para><para>In conclusion, I record my thanks to Mr Speaker for the excellent way in which he led the Delegationâand as Deputy Leader I very much appreciated the co-operation and goodwill of the other delegates.</para><para>There are always many  people who contribute to our work. Foremost among these, was Ambassador Stephen Brady and his staff who did a superb job in coordinating and advising the Delegation during its visit to Norway.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>6668</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>6668</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>6668</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>6668</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report No. 22, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999</inline> , together with submissions, <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline>  and minutes of proceedings.

In the 39th Parliament, the Treaties Committee continues to deal with a heavy workload.</para><para>The five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999 were:</para><para>.	 a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India; 
</para><para>.	 a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Lithuania;</para><para>.	 a proposed Trade and Economic Relations Agreement with Fiji;</para><para>.	 amendments proposed to the Constitution of the World Health Organisation; and</para><para>.	 a proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</para><para>Our review of these five treaties followed our standing practice: they were advertised nationally and we held two short public hearings, taking evidence from officials in the appropriate Government agencies.</para><para>Two treaties in this group raised some significant issues.</para><para>The proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India is an important agreement with a significant trading partner. The obvious comparison is- with the IPPA with Pakistan, considered by the Committee in its <inline font-style="italic">Fifteenth Report </inline> which was tabled on 2 July 1998.</para><para>In that Report, we drew attention to nuclear tests in South Asia 1998, adding that these tests had added `a considerable irritant' to the bilateral relationship with Pakistan.</para><para>Since then, there have been further missile tests and, more importantly, fighting in Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan. In spite of a number of earlier and more positive indicators this shows no signs of resolution and may in fact become.the fourth major conflict between the two nations.</para><para>Unfortunately, there are domestic reasons on both sides that explain why such a conflict has continued and could develop from a conflict in the disputed territory.</para><para>We support our Government's approach towards nations in this region, and believe that the Australian position in dealings with these two nations must be absolutely even-handed.</para><para>Last year, we recommended that ratification of the IPPA with Pakistan should be delayed until Ministerial and senior official contacts resumed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised during our review of the proposed IPPA with India that there had been some movement, by both India and Pakistan, to comply with some of the elements of the UN Security Council's resolution about nuclear testing.</para><para>In the current situation, where the outcome of the fighting is not yet clear, we believe that little purpose would be served by delaying implementation of the proposed IPPA.</para><para>During the negotiation of IPPAs, Australia uses its own Model text. In the case of this proposed IPPA with India, there were a number of changes to this 
 text because India also has its preferred version. It was necessary to reconcile the two texts and, while some minor changes were required to the Australian version, the proposed IPPA is consistent with our requirements to protect investments.</para><para>The other significant agreement tabled on 11 May 1999 was the proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</para><para>In <inline font-style="italic">Report 20</inline> , the Committee reviewed the proposed MRA with the European Community. We expressed some concerns about the understanding of the EU rules of origin, and hoped that the efforts of Australian companies to export goods assembled here would not be hampered by the new arrangements.</para><para>Implementation of this Agreement has not been very smooth, with considerable delays in finalising it after signature.</para><para>In conjunction with the MRA for the EU, the proposed Agreement will ensure that uniform conformity assessment provisions apply between European Economic Area countries. New examination requirements are intended to ensure free movement of Australian goods from particular product areas into and between those countries. The MRA deals with competence to test and certify a specified range of products to meet domestic regulatory requirements. It will provide alternative mechanisms for importers/exporters to comply with regulatory requirements while avoiding delays and costs. Thus, when the proposed MRA is operating, one examination in Australia by conformity assessment bodies will suffice for both domestic and export markets.</para><para>We have concerns about this proposed Agreement which are highlighted by the position in which a company, Nulite Systems International Pty Ltd. found itself in connection with the MRA with the European Community.</para><para>This firm found out the hard way that in the area of its products, non-metallic, bio-material dental restoratives and associated products, the EU's standards for these products were considerably higher than Australia's.

I rise to speak a bit earlier than I planned but I am glad to see we are making good progress. First of all I want to indicate at the outset that the Labor opposition supports the thrust of the major bill in that it seeks to consolidate 12 existing family payments into two and to simplify two child-care payments by creating one single regime. Labor supports those measures as being a step in the right direction in terms of simplifying it and making it more understandable for Australian families to access social security payments.</para></talk.start><para>I remember lobbying the then Labor social security minister about that issue some years ago. I know he was committed to a similar process of finding a way to make things more simplified but of course the difficulty always with those sorts of processes is to make sure that, in going for simplicity over complexity, you do no erode the very important basis on which a number of those payments were erected; that is, to reflect the needs of different types of families and their different types of problems. We have a very diverse and complex set of families with a diverse and complex set of needs and so, while I think we all support the need for simplicity, transparency and the least complicated system possible, clearly we also want the system to reflect and accommodate those different needs. That is always a task and a challenge, one that has bipartisan support as we try and work our way through these sorts of issues.</para><para>So, while simplification is laudable, the test will be whether or not we meet the needs of all Australian families and move into a more simplified and hopefully more transparent social system. I know one of the concerns always in this area is making sure that families get their entitlements. There has been a whole range of measures over the years, introduced by both sides of politics, that have not been as successful as they should have 
 been because people have not been able to work out that they are entitled to them or how to access them, so that will be one of the tests for this measure. So, as I say, we do support the general thrust and we hope that, as well as rationalising the system, there are rational outcomes as well.</para><para>I do want to say that it is unfortunate that these measures have been linked to the goods and services tax debate. The Labor Party's fundamental proposition is that the goods and services tax is a regressive measure that will impact unfairly and harshly on families. To have this measure tied up with the goods and services tax legislation, from our point of view is unfortunate and tends to prevent us from focusing properly on the measures contained in these bills. But, if nothing else, I am a realist. We have had the debate on the GST and, while there are other measures to go, it is quite clear that this parliament is going to carry those bills.</para><para>I am pleased to say that these bills will be far more beneficial and will make some contribution to ameliorating the worst impacts of the GST, but they will not provide the sort of protection that I believe is necessary for Australian families, because the GST will be regressive in its impact. It will impact on families more harshly than the current taxation regime, it will have a disproportionate impact on low income families, and it will have a disproportionate impact on people like disability pensioners and others who rely a great deal on services which currently are not taxed. So, while we are prepared to support this measure, its linkage with the GST is highly unfortunate and means that it has not had the sort of attention that the measure deserved. But, as I say, we are prepared to take a rational view of these things and, because we think it is generally a beneficial measure, we will be supporting the bill.</para><para>I want to address a couple of other measures in the related bills. As a result of the agreement between the government and the majority of Democrat senators, we have not really had proper time to look at the consequential bills that are included in this package. I have a couple of concerns which are the subject of amendments I will be moving 
 in the committee stage, but I have a more general concern that the speed with which these bills have been introducedâpushed through the House of Representatives and then into the Senate without any committee inquiry process or any great public consultationâis a very poor process and leaves me concerned that there may well be aspects of these related bills that have not received the scrutiny that they need and that we will not make properly informed judgments on these bills.</para><para>I know there is always a bit of time pressure, but these bills have been introduced at very short notice and with very scant consideration. I think we would all agree that in terms of process that is not desirable, and so I have put a caveat on my support for some of the measures in these bills because I do not think either the parliament or the community more generally have had a chance to get on top of some of the issues. As they go to questions of administration, they are quite complex and there are potential problems that have not been considered, so I have some concern about that.</para><para>Of particular concern is the approach taken in these bills in relation to child-care matters. When we were briefed  by the minister's staff on the family assistance package as it related to child care, we were told that the details of the child-care issues at stake in the new regimeâthe questions of how people would be paid, who would be a qualified carer and all those sorts of thingsâwould all be contained in the  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 . In the last couple of days I have been able to have a look at the bills, and I have found that the child-care issues have not been included. Today I received the Library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digests</inline> on these bills. It quite rightly makes the same pointâthat the treatment of child-care regulation or child-care arrangements under these bills is quite different. I quote the Library's <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digests</inline>:</para><para>Rather than set out the requirements in the bill concerning claims, determinations and payments, new division 4 basically provides for the making of regulations about how individuals in approved child-care services can become entitled to have 
 payments of child-care benefit made and how such payments are to be made.</para><para>So, rather than the bill containing, as we were assured, the details of the regime in terms of child care, it has been treated quite differently from the approach in the more general social security matters, and the matters will all have to be dealt with by way of regulation. I know many of those will be disallowable instruments, and the parliament will have the opportunity to consider those regulations in due course, but I do think that that is not a proper way to go. It is a case of giving too much authority and too much content in regulations and not enough in the primary legislation.</para><para>There has always been a tendency or a temptation on behalf of government to adopt that sort of approach because it does mean that parliament has less scrutiny of the detail and less ability to influence the detail. I am sure that was not the case on this occasionâmaybe it was the speed with which things were doneâbut it does leave the parliament with less ability to properly scrutinise and determine how those arrangements are put in place.</para><para>While I have received assurances from the government about the new regime that there will be very little change to the current regime that is in place, I do have some concerns about this method. I put the government on notice that the Labor opposition will scrutinise those regulations very carefully and will not hesitate to use the power to block those regulations if they are not in accordance with both proper practice and the assurances given to us. I am sure the Democrats will also take a fairly critical look at them because we are not getting the opportunity on this occasion to examine them because of the way this has been structured. As I say, I hope there is nothing more sinister or devious involved in this approach.</para><para>As the opposition child-care spokesperson, I will be taking a very keen interest to make sure that the industry receives reassurance about the concerns that it has about some of the options the government was considering. The government has given commitments on a number of those matters, such as payment 
 in arrears rather than in advance and a couple of other issues. I do want to note that, while the government has lived up to its election commitment to provide that parents should be able to choose to be paid directly, I think the reality of the bill's measures is that the current system will stay in place for the majority of families. For people to take the annual payment option, I think they would need to be very high income earners; otherwise they would not be able to carry the cost of their child care each week.</para><para>While I am sure the government will be keen to claim that this measure meets its election commitments, I think good sense has prevailed and most families will continue to operate under the regime currently in place. That will provide much more security to child-care providers who, I think, felt very threatened by the move to an alternative regime, because they thought that they could end up with substantial bad debt problems. As we all know, bad debt is a constant threat to small businesses at the best of times. Child-care centres have some problems in that area, but I think they were most concerned that that would be exacerbated. So I am pleased that the regime in place within this legislative framework will prevent that becoming a more significant problem for the sector.</para><para>The other thing to note about the level of child-care assistance is that, while the extra assistance for child care will be welcomed, it does not apply until July 2000. I think, then, it will basically go only part way to compensating for the cap that the government has imposed on child-care assistance for the last two years and does nothing to address the real structural issues at stake in the child-care industry in this country. The affordability problem is driving closure of centres and forcing families to remove children from formal child care. I am afraid the beneficial measures contained in this bill will come too late to halt that process and, I think, come too late for many families in terms of them accessing the formal child-care sector. Any assistance will obviously help, but I do not think it will be enough. It will be very much a case of too little, too late. When combined with the government's other measures of 
 reducing funding for child care and the other structural changes made by this government over the last couple of years, I think we will continue to see enormous pressure on families' capacity to afford child care and enormous stress on the industry's ability to cope, given that significant drop in demand.</para><para>But with those comments, I wish to reiterate that we will be supporting the bills. I have circulated a couple of amendments to the  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 , and I see that Senator Bartlett has moved what I suspect are similar amendmentsâat least in one respect. I hope those are supported, because they raise very serious issues about people's access to review of decisions. I will address those concerns in the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>6673</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Senate is debating in the second reading stage the <inline ref="r800">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999</inline> , the <inline ref="r799">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Consequential and Related Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline> , the <inline ref="r835">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Consequential and Related Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999</inline>  and <inline ref="r836">A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999</inline> . This legislation contains a number of improvements to family assistance measures to lighten the burden placed on many families by the government's youth allowance package last year and, as the previous speaker indicated, has been linked to the overall package of changes as part of the A New Tax System package.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats certainly support measures which give greater financial support to families and measures that raise the income test threshold to a more realistic rate and address the poverty trap caused by the current 50 per cent taper rate. The impact of poverty traps under existing legislation is certainly one of the biggest disincentive measures, and the Democrats welcome the moves in this legislation to mitigate that, as we did other measures relating to pensions. We certainly hope that the government does consider acting in the future in the area that I believe is perhaps the one most in need of action, which is the poverty trap or taper rate applying to unem 
 ployed people. We certainly welcome this improvement in the taper rate contained in this legislation.</para><para>I would like to put on the record the Democrats' continuing concerns with definitions of age of independence. Defining the age of independence for a student as 25 and for a young unemployed person as 21 is inconsistent with definitions of adulthood and independence in other legislation and perpetrates an irrational view of young people's circumstances and real responsibilities. Senator Harradine, as senators would be aware, in debates over the youth allowance legislation last year put on record his concerns at the pressure that would be put on lower and middle income earners who would be hit harder because they face the financial burden of supporting young adult children up to the age of 21 for young unemployed and up to 25 years old for students. The Democrats are still of the belief that 18 should be the recognised age of independence, whether people are unemployed or students. It provides a more accurate reflection of the realities of society and also the reality of financial burdens that young adults face.</para><para>This legislation provides some relief for families who were impacted by the youth allowance measures implemented last year. At that time, the government gave the following undertaking to Senator Harradine with respect to support for those families. They assured Senator Harradine that:</para><para>. . . in restructuring the Australian taxation system, to which this government is committed, the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.</para><para>While this concern was not initially honoured by the government, this bill finally makes good that commitment by increasing the family tax benefit part A to $50 per fortnight and by increasing eligibility for it. Certain young persons aged 21 to 25 who are engaged in full-time study and young unemployed persons aged 18 to 25 will be eligible for the family tax benefit part A. Where they would attract a higher rate of income support as a family tax benefit child than they would as a youth allowance recipient, they will be 
 able to opt for the former, with the payments going to an adult. This measure involves an additional $50 million in expenditure per year by the government, and that will address some of the financial hardships suffered since the implementation of the youth allowance last year.</para><para>Of course, there is still some way to go in this area. I note concerns raised within the welfare sector that these amendments will benefit higher income families while less relief will be afforded families where the young person is eligible for a higher rate of youth allowance. These are measures that the Democrats believe do need ongoing attention; however, we welcome the financial relief contained in this bill as an important first step to redressing some of the other anomalies contained in the provision of family and youth income support. There are some significant advances here and, as always when advances occur, the Democrats are quite happy to acknowledge them and support them, as we will do. As Senator Evans indicated, there are a couple of areas where there are some amendments, which we will address in the committee stage, and I will outline my rationale for those at the time. In closing, Madam Acting Deputy President, I would like to check whether there any other speakers on this bill present in the chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Reynolds)</name></talker><para>âIt appears not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âIn which case, I could wax lyrical for another five minutes or we could have an early dinner break; I thought I would spare you the trauma and let you have dinner four minutes earlier. I do have one sentence left. Whilst it is important that the measures in this bill help address the financial needs of familiesâand the Democrats welcome thoseâI would like to emphasise that one of the growing areas of poverty in society is that of young single people. The needs of single people is an area of society which I think, perhaps in the rush to try to address the very real financial needs of families, has been a bit obscured by that. It certainly does appear from recent research that young single people are often amongst the biggest growing group in society in terms 
 of poverty levels, and it is an area that I think we do need to pay more attention to when we are looking at income support and other forms of financial assistance and legislation of that type. So I would like to certainly flag the Democrats' interest in ensuring that that group in society is not forgotten. That is not to say, of course, that families are not important or that they do not have extra financial burdens; we are pleased that this legislation does go a long way towards addressing some of those burdens. It is legislation that the Democrats support.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.26 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I did have brief discussions with the minister's office today about this and the subsequent amendment, which has also been circulated and also contained in Senator Evans's circulated amendments.</para><para>The issue this seeks to address is basically the component of the act which, in this case, seeks to limit the amount of time in which people have the ability to appeal a decision. As I understand it, currently the Social Security Act provides that a person can appeal a decision from the original decision maker at any time, although there are some limitations. 
 The person is entitled to back-payment only to the date on which the original decision was made, if their application for review is made within three months of receiving the written decision.</para><para>As I think Senator Evans indicated in his speech in the second reading debate, this was part of a package of legislation linked in with a large number of tax bills. From the Democrats' perspective, we have not really had adequate time, given our limited resources and focus, to examine the desirability or otherwise of this measure. I know the government does have some arguments as to why it is a good idea. However, if it is as good an idea as the government thinks, it can spend the intervening couple months convincing either us or the ALP of that when we get to the  Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999  later in the year. I am certainly quite willing to be open to arguments and revisit the issue then, if there are suitable arguments for proceeding down this path.

Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, a greatly respected former social security minister whose proposal this is, suggested that the administration of a mass decision making system requires some finality in dealing with applicants and that a period of 12 months would be appropriate for a person to seek a review of a departmental officer's decision. This provision will ensure that the family assistance review and appeals system compares more consistently with other systems in which time limits apply. For example, the Refugee Review Tribunal and Migration Review Tribunal both allow a total of 35 days for application for review by the tribunal of a decision made in Australia. There is no internal review and they have no special circumstances exemption to the time limits.</para><para>The Archives Act permits destruction of a file 12 months after a customer ceases to receive payment, and it is no advantage to have to deal with a request for review where the papers have been destroyed and there is virtually no other available evidence. In such cases as present, it is common for the AAT not to grant extensions of time. The bill provides a capacity to extend the time limit where there are special circumstances. If you like, Senator Bartlett, I see that as being the necessary fall-back or protection for individuals' rights.

The chamber will notice that we did not seek to amend this section ourselves. Our main concern is with the next measure, which was the 28-day limit on appeals to SSAT.

 been a great deal of consideration of what has been in the administration bills.</para></talk.start><para>There is a bit of nervousness on our part that there has not been proper consideration of the implications of some of these measures. From a quick chat I have had with the opposition spokesman on social security, Mr Wayne Swan, while he was not necessarily inclined to oppose, our general approach is to be a bit cautious about some of these proposals till we are able to discuss what they mean in more detail with those who represent people who could be adversely affected.</para><para>On balance, while our main concern is with the next section, which we will be opposing, we are inclined to support the Democrat amendments on the same basis that we think there needs to be a bit more light and air applied to these measures. They are part of an approach to social security that will be dealt with more fundamentally, I gather, in a bill coming before us a bit later. In the short term, we are inclined to err on the side of caution. For that reason, we will be supporting these two Democrat amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6677</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI respond briefly to Senator Evans.

As I mentioned to Senator Bartlett, there would still be the opportunity for people to get the time limit extended where there are special circumstances.

This one limiting appeals to the SSAT to only 28 days is particularly problematic. As I said previously, we are willing to examine it in more detail over the longer period of time. Partly in response to some of the minister's previous comments, it would be preferable to look at all of the issues that were raised in the Guilfoyle report as a group rather than in a piecemeal way, with some aspects of it coming in here and some aspects coming in other legislation. A lot of different proposals have been put forward there, and I think they need to be looked at in detail.

 particularly in this area, the Democrats would be keen to remove this section from the bill at this stage, examine it more fully and the rationale behind it when we get to later legislation and do that as a whole. That is a more appropriate way to go and certainly what we would prefer to do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>6678</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor opposition have a similar amendment to that of the Democrats, which is to oppose clause 112. Our opposition is based on the short consultation time we have been able to have and the fact that some concerns have been raised by people who represent people in appeals before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as to the process suggested. We are concerned that the effect of the limit proposed by the government is to effectively cut off the right of appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and then the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, because one flows from the other. As Senator Bartlett has said, we anticipated these measures being part of the <inline ref="r829">Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999</inline> , to be dealt with when we considered that bill. We are most concerned that they do not go through the chamber today without the concerns being raised and, hopefully, that we do not end up with such a precedent being included.</para></talk.start><para>We are not at all convinced that the measure is necessary. I will be interested to hear what the minister has to say, but our view is that this has the potential to impact on those who are most vulnerable in our community because of their lack of language skills, their non-English speaking background or other difficulties they might have, such as intellectual disabilities. These people are the ones less likely to be able to cope with the system and to be able necessarily to exercise their rights within that time frame. They may well be in a position of crisis when they have to look to exercise those rights. There are a range of reasons why people might well be at that time homeless, recently unemployed or going through a family crisis and who are not necessarily in a position to fully understand or advocate their own rights within a 28-day time limit. The Labor Party is most concerned that that might have an impact on their ability 
 to exercise their rights. We do not think that would be a desirable outcome.</para><para>It has also been put to us that in some cases we might see an increase in the number of appeals as welfare rights advocates encourage people to make appeals to protect their rights if they are uncertain about the final outcome of their overall situation. I know the minister has already referred in a previous debate to the question of special circumstances, but we are concerned how that provision might be applied, in the sense that it is another hurdle for people to get over to prove that their circumstances are somehow special.</para><para>We do not see the justification for the 28-day time limit. We think that in the regime the government is putting in place people have the real potential to be disadvantaged and that the special circumstances test may provide a hurdle that is too high for people genuinely in need of exercising those appeal rights. My major concern is that those who are least able to look after themselves and who are most vulnerable will be those for whom the rules will not work. Clearly, we want a social security system that allows all those people to access their full rights. For those reasons we think it would be inappropriate to include the 28-day time limit and we will be opposing it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6679</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank senators for their contribution to this aspect of the legislation. I do think that perhaps their fears are unfounded. Clause 112 establishes a 28-day time limit following the notification of a decision for application to the SSAT for review. Dame Margaret pointed out that in most jurisdictions there is some period during which an appeal against a decision may be lodged. That of itself is not an untoward provision.</para></talk.start><para>This provision sets a time for lodging an appeal that is consistent with that which currently exists under the Social Security Act for lodgment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It has not been seen to be an unfair time limit for appeals to the AAT. I do not understand why it could be seen as being an 
 unfair time limit for application to the SSAT for a review. By the time we get to that stage in the system, the customer will have received a letter from an authorised review officer explaining the adverse decision in plain English and, accompanying the letter, an application for appeal to the SSAT and information on how to lodge an appeal. With this level of information and assistance, I do not think it is unreasonable for a customer to decide to lodge an appeal within 28 days.</para><para>Having said thatâand Senator Evans has just emphasised the issue of special circumstancesâcapacity is provided in the bill for the period of appeal to be extended where there are special circumstances. I would remind senators that Centrelink and the social security system have for many years been accustomed to dealing with people who are particularly vulnerable. It may be people with mental illness or intellectual incapacity or who are perhaps addicted to alcohol or drugs and are therefore not well able to represent their own interests. The need to protect the people for whom the special circumstances provision is provided is well understood by both the Department of Family and Community Services and Centrelink. I believe that in the circumstances the time limit is not unfair, but even if people had some vulnerability which precluded them from getting in application in that 28 days, the special circumstances provision would be a safety net to protect the most vulnerable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6679</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn brief response to that, from my point of view, on behalf of the Democrats, before agreeing to such a time limitâwhich on the face of it seems a fairly short period of time in my experienceâI would certainly like to be able to examine the reality of the current situation in a bit more detail: how long people currently take to appeal the SSAT, and what percentage of people take longer than 28 days and what the reasons might be in those circumstances. Certainly, there is a category here of special circumstances that gives some flexibility, but I am concerned that that is a little bit arbitrary. I realise that you need to have some space for flexibility in any area of administrative law 
 but, in something that is dealing with people's basic welfare and ability to get some basic income support, I think arbitrariness is a bit of a dangerous component to have too much of. So that does give me some concern.</para></talk.start><para>I would again indicate to the minister that the Democrats and I am sure the Australian Labor Partyâreasonable folks that they areâare quite willing to examine this and be convinced, once we have had the opportunity to look at it in a bit more detail. The Democrats, as the government and indeed the nation as a whole are well aware, are quite willing to cooperate with the government on the odd occasion. I am sure that we can extend that cooperativeness to an area such as this, if the arguments are good enough, but certainly I am also keen to ensure that we have enough time. I do not see it as being a major problem to the administration of government or the finances of the nation for us to consider this at a bit more length and re-include this as part of the overall system when we do the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999, if enough of the Senate have been convinced that that is the way to go.</para><para>I do think that particularly with this bill, certainly on the surface, that a 28-day limit seems to be quite a short period of time in which to enable people to appeal. Whilst there is the special circumstances exemption, it is not particularly clearly defined and leaves some room for arbitrariness, which again would be of concern to the Democrats. So I would indicate that we would press this issue, at this point in time, to seek to remove this clause from the bill. Once we have looked at it more closely over the next couple of months, we might be persuaded to go down the path that the government is suggesting across the board in the Social Security Act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that clause 112 stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.

The government is proposing a new section which codifies the powers of the executive director and effectively allows for that person, on certain occasions and within certain guidelines, to rule that all social security appeal matters are heard by way of written submission and not orally. The amendment seeks to insert the option of all parties needing to consent to the matter being conducted without oral submissions.</para><para>We are concerned that this might create a dangerous precedent whereby parties are not allowed to make oral submissions in support of their claims by a decision of the executive director. I am sure the minister will say there are appropriate guidelines and restrictions on that power, but we are concerned that parties may not have that opportunity. That may well be the best way for them to put forward their case and, if they are restricted from articulating their case in this way, that may limit their right to a fair hearing and to seek the benefits of a favourable decision from the tribunal.</para><para>Again, this is one of these measures that I understand will be in the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999, which will come before the parliament again in August. It may well be that there is some way of making progress on this measure other than this, but at this stage we are very concerned that the government's policy direction would not necessarily allow people the right to make oral submissions. We think the amendment we are moving, which basically requires the consent of all the parties to obviate that requirement to have oral hearings, is a better approach.

It is interesting that Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has been mentioned here tonight. I was a member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the days when she was the minister. There was a big debate about oral hearings as opposed to written submissions. It is interesting to note that, in those days, one of the strongest supporters of oral hearings was Senator Mal Colston.</para></talk.start><para>In that debate, one of the issues was that a very small percentage of appellants' appeals was upheld, particularly by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in Brisbane. I believed, as others did at the time, that one of the reasons was that people were discouraged from making appearances and giving oral evidence. I remember wading through acres of paper, and often the people who were appealing were not aware of the detrimental reports which were given from time to time in writing and which were then used by the tribunal against the appeal. I often felt that if only people could appear and give oral evidence, then the determination would have gone the other way.</para><para>When there was a review by the minister of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal's operation, I spoke strongly about this. It is interesting that, a little later on, I was invited to step down from the appeals tribunal. At the time I was strongly supported by Senator George Georges, who took up the case. But that is all history; you do not really want to know about that.</para><para>What I do want to underline is that I believe this measure is important. It is important to preserve the right of people to an oral hearing and that that right will not simply fall over because of a decision by the executive director without people being aware of their rights and agreeing to the abrogation of their right to an oral hearing. The amendment does that. It determines that there should be consent, and if there is consent then the determination can be made on the basis of written submissions, but there should be some safeguard to that. Because of that debate of some 
 years ago and how important it was for people to exercise the right to an oral hearing, I would urge the Senate to support the Labor amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>6682</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Chairman, I was interested in that history.

But that is history, as Senator Woodley said.</para></talk.start><para>I draw this to the Senate's attention: the bill actually provides that the executive director `may direct' a hearing `without oral submissions', if the executive director considers the review hearing `could be determined fairly on the basis of written submissions'. The word is `may', not `have to' or `compelled to'; he or she may direct it, if he or she considers that the hearing `could be determined fairly on the basis of written submissions'. </para><para>Clause 126 goes on to say in part (4), subsection 1: `The tribunal may, after considering those written submissions . . . ' So if the director says that it would be fair to all the parties to go on the written papers to the SSAT, the SSAT, after reading the submissions, can still say, `We believe that the parties should be permitted to make oral submissions.' I am sure Senator Woodley would recognise that that does put in that balance what you are concerned aboutâthat is, of people being excluded from being heard. I understand that concern, but I think subsection (1) and subsection (4) of clause 126 do protect and look after the concerns that Senator Woodley was referring to.</para><para>In addition, I am concerned at the drafting of the ALP amendment. I do not know whether Senator Evans has had a really hard look at the drafting. To me it looks a bit nonsensical. I will demonstrate why. The ALP's second amendment is:</para><para>Clause 126, page 103, (lines 2 to 6), omit subclause (1), substitute:</para><para>(1) The Executive Director may directâ 
</para><para>there it is, `may', but he or she directsâ</para><para>that a hearing be conducted without oral submissions . . . if . . .</para><para>et cetera. Part (b) says:</para><para>. . . all parties to the review consent to the hearing being conducted without oral submissions.</para><para>So, on the one hand, the executive director is being given the powerâthe discretion, if you like to put it that way, because it is `may' directâto direct. That is what subsection (1) says: `may direct'. Then in 1 (b), it says if:</para><para>. . . all parties to the review consent to the hearing being conducted without oral submissions.</para><para>So on the one hand he has the power to direct and on the other hand it has to be with the consent of all the parties. So what is direction if it cannot be exercised without the consent of all the parties? I think somebody took their mind out of gear between the drafting of the second line and the last line. From that point of view, I do not think your amendment is a very good one. Quite apart from whatever you were trying to achieve, the drafting is not all that crash-hot.</para><para>I will not delay the Senate any longer. For both those reasonsâthat there is sufficient protection within the government's legislation and that the ALP's attempt to amend it is not a very satisfactory attemptâI would urge the Senate to oppose the opposition's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>6682</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not want to delay the Senate unduly, but certainly the minister's last point was lost on me. The wording is exactly the same as in the government's bill, except that we say the executive director `may direct' that a hearing be conducted and then we set down the provisos. The first is they have to be satisfied that it can be determined fairly and the second is that they have consulted the parties and gained their consent. It seems to be quite straightforward, but I admit that, unlike the minister, who is one of 19 lawyers on the front bench of the Liberal Party, I am not a lawyer. But it seems to me that the wording is exactly the same as that used in the bill. The direction, though, can only be issued once they have satisfied the two criteria; one of those is getting the consent of the parties. Otherwise, the wording is in exactly the same language as is in the govern 
 ment's bill. Anyway, I do not think we want to delay with an unduly long debate.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me that that objection does not have a great deal of substance. The wording is much the same. What we are inserting is that, before they make that direction, they seek the consent of the parties. Obviously the intent of the thing is to make sure they have that consent rather than exercise that purely on their own view. But I urge the Senate to support the amendment.</para><para>Question put:</para><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chris Evans's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:19:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator S.

 New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999 and two other bills relating to non-disclosureâ<inline ref="r812">A New Tax System (Ultimate Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 1) 1999</inline>  and <inline ref="r813">A New Tax System (Ultimate Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 2) 1999</inline> . The issue of tax avoidance through family trusts is one that we on the Labor side of the chamber have been concerned about for a long time. We have been calling on the government to take action and, most recently, to abide by its undertaking to provide consistent treatment of tax entities so that trusts are taxed in the same way as companies.</para></talk.start><para>In announcing that it intends to do this, the government has claimed a positive budgetary impact of $1.67 billion in the year 2000-01, declining to $650 million in the year 2002-03. However, we have not yet seen those bills. We have only seen the ones that are now before the chamber. It is a small measure to deal with some of the abuses of tax structures for the purpose of tax avoidance and evasion. It requires the disclosure of the ultimate beneficiaries of income from trusts. That is so that the Commissioner of Taxation can check whether each beneficiary has properly disclosed the net income of their net assets, including the receipt of any tax preferred amounts. Failing that disclosure, the income of the trust will be taxed at the top marginal rate, plus the Medicare levy.</para><para>However, these requirements apply only to closely held trusts, which are defined in the billâand I will not read the provisionâand discretionary trusts, which are also defined in the bill. I will not read that provision either, except to say that a discretionary trust is a trust that is not a fixed trustâthat is, one where persons have fixed entitlements to all the income and assets of the trust. A fixed entitlement is an indefeasible interest in a share of the income or assets of a trust.</para><para>The bills before us specifically exclude unit trusts with units listed on the Stock Exchangeâcomplying superannuation funds, deposit funds, pooled superannuation trusts and deceased estates until the fifth anniversary of the death. The fact that it is only expected to raise an additional $30 million a year is a demonstration of how limited this measure 
 is. There are many greater tax avoidance and evasion issues associated with trusts. The government's reluctance to come to grips with these avoidance and evasion issues shows how uninterested it is in real tax reform that protects the revenue and makes everyone pay their fair share.</para><para>There is every sign that the government wants little more than a few measures it can point to to deflect criticism about its lack of action. The lack of speed and commitment in this area has now reached the dimensions of a scandal of such proportions that, in the context of this bill, it requires a second reading amendment. I was going to apologise to the chamber for not being able to circulate this amendment because we have been moving faster than I anticipated, but the Clerk has acknowledged that it has been circulated. I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>"but the Senate is of the view that:</para><para>	 (a)	 in relation to tax avoidance:</para><para>		 (i)	 the Government has failed for three years to take adequate action to deal with major tax avoidance and evasion by high wealth individuals using complex trust structures;</para><para>		 (ii)	 lack of action is causing major ongoing losses of revenue;</para><para>		 (iii)	 at the time these aggressive tax avoidance and evasion schemes were first identified by the Australian Taxation Office in late 1995 and early 1996 an amount of $800 million was being evaded by 80 high wealth individuals;</para><para>		 (iv)	 some of the high wealth individuals participating in these schemes were manipulating their taxable incomes to declare as little as $20,000 a year and so claim various government benefits;</para><para>		 (v)	 the legislative action required to eliminate these schemes is well understood by the Australian Taxation Office; and</para><para>		 (vi)	 the lack of adequate action on tax avoidance and evasion using trusts is an indicator of the Government's failure to provide proper and fair tax reforms; and</para><para>	 (b)	 in relation to so called taxation reform, of which this bill forms a part as a component of the New Tax System: 
</para><para>		 (i)	 the government has not achieved real tax reforms in Australia, it has merely agreed to introduce an unfair GST;</para><para>		 (ii)	 the new Howard/Lees GST will involve a massive tax mix switch which will hurt ordinary families, which is directly contrary to the balloted policy of the Australian Democrats;</para><para>		 (iii)	 the Howard/Lees deal will actually increase the tax on food in Australia;</para><para>		 (iv)	 ordinary people will now face a GST on top of state indirect taxes on bank accounts; and</para><para>		 (v)	 the amended tax package is still unfair and will also damage the environment".</para><para>It is obvious to anyone with a serious interest in tax policy that there is scope for tax avoidance and evasion using tax structures. Throughout 1994 and 1995 the Treasurer's office pressed Treasury for advice on the extent of the problem and the possible remedies. It was raised on an almost weekly basis in meetings with the department. Nothing was forthcoming until 9 November 1995 when the Australian Taxation Office, not the Treasury, advised that they had uncovered a significant problem using multiple trust structures. They had been using new software which was capable of finding patterns in large amounts of seemingly unrelated information. They had found that large numbers of seemingly unrelated trusts were in fact related and a range of techniques were being used by high-wealth individuals to reduce tax liabilities to low or negligible levels.</para><para>Treasury and the tax office worked on the issue over the next three months, eventually advising the Treasurer that it would be appropriate to make a public announcement that the government would act to end these practices. The press release issued by Treasurer Ralph Willis on 11 February 1996 accurately set out the issues. It was entitled, `High-wealth individuals: taxation of trusts.' I have indicated a copy of this press release to the minister, who is not at the table but is in the chamber. I would seek leave to incorporate the text of this press release because it does set the record straight. The minister did indicate to me that that was an acceptable action.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document  read as follows</inline>â</para><para>On November 9, 1995 I was informed by the Australian Taxation Office that as part of the Compliance Enforcement Strategy authorised by the Government, it had conducted analysis of the accumulation of wealth by certain individuals and the taxes paid by them. That analysis revealed that some high wealth individuals were employing strategies which allowed them to accumulate wealth, enjoy a lavish lifestyle, but pay little or no tax. The analysis was in its early stages but the ATO believed the revenue implications might amount to several hundred million dollars.</para><para>At my request, the ATO and Treasury provided more extensive advice and analysis on December 20 1995. It revealed that in the 1993 financial year, 80 individuals each with a net work of over $30 million had returned taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. This enabled some of them to qualify for low income rebates, Medicare exemptions, deferral of HECS payments and reduced child support payments. The tax minimisation techniques employed by these individuals mainly involved the use of trusts.</para><para>By January 19, 1996, the ATO and Treasury were able to advise that on the basis of the work undertaken to date in respect to 100 wealthy individuals alone, appropriate measures to deal with a range of specific tax minimisation techniques using trusts would produce additional revenue of at least $500 million. Later at a meeting on January 23, 1996, Treasury gave me verbal advice raising that estimate to $800 million. Some amount could be forthcoming in 1996-97, but the first full year effect would be in 1997-98.</para><para>The January 19, 1996 advice also included separate revenue estimates in addition to the $800 million for techniques involving thin capitalisation and abuses of the provisions for payments by trusts to foreign charities.</para><para>The ATO has identified a number of complex tax planning arrangements used by some wealthy individuals to avoid tax, these include:</para><para>-	 the characterisation of income as capital by the use of multiple trust structures to conceal a common controlling mind. If the activities of the various trusts and associated companies were viewed as a whole, the profits of the group could be treated as trading income. The ATO has found a number of cases of wealthy individuals operating over 100 trusts;</para><para>-	 the creation of artificial losses (revenue as well as capital) to neutralise otherwise taxable profits, particularly through the use of related party transactions;</para><para>-	 distributions to wealthy individuals and family members being disguised as loans and other benefits which are claimed to be non-taxable. In relation to companies this includes exploitation of 
 alleged weaknesses in section 47A and 108 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, of the deemed dividend provisions;</para><para>-	 the continued use of offshore trusts to hold significant funds which seem to be applied for the benefit of wealthy individuals and their families; and</para><para>-	 the use of Australian charitable trusts and overseas organisations to disguise benefits provided by family trading trusts to family members.</para><para>Obviously, these are not techniques which are practised by the overwhelming majority of trusts operated by and for Australians. Trusts provide an appropriate structure to meet a range of legitimate needs such as for charities, education and non-profit organisations, deceased estates, a variety of family purposes, and for solicitors and other professionals. The Government will not interfere with these arrangements. The Government undertakes that the measures it will adopt will ensure that activities not involving tax avoidance are not adversely affected.</para><para>No responsible government could stand back and let blatant abuse of the tax system by extremely wealthy individuals continue. The ATO is undertaking action to test the effectiveness of the existing law to deal with some of these practices. However, it is not expected that an outcome will be achieved by these means in the near future due to the long time frames involved in testing issues before the courts. The ATO has advised that it is particularly difficult to run test cases in these areas because the individuals concerned will settle at the end of the day rather than have their private affairs or practices exposed to the public.</para><para>On January 29, 1996, I wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner for Taxation, asking them as a matter or urgency to develop a legislative response to cover income from the 1996-97 financial year. The new tax measures which the Government will introduce to deal with these specific areas of tax avoidance will be prospective not retrospective.</para><para>One of the most important things this Labor Government has given Australia since it was elected in 1983 is a tax system based on the principle of integrity and fairness. Maintaining that basic integrity and fairness requires stamping out tax avoidance wherever and whenever it emerges.</para><para>The reason these measures are being announced today is because the Government is seeking a mandate to deal with this area of tax avoidance. We call on the other parties in this election to support these reforms. I am offering Mr Howard a briefing this afternoon from the Commissioner of Taxation.</para><para>The Treasurer</para><para>Ralph Willis</para><para>11 February 1996 
</para><para>When you read that press release you will see a very clear case for reform and the proposals that the Labor governmentâhad it been returnedâwould have carried through. The press release also refers to the shadow Treasurer. I understand he received a briefing the very next day.</para><para>More than three years have passed and the two substantial things that have changed are the government and the fact that Australia no longer has a government that will do anything about the scandal. If the Howard government had any interest in the fairness and integrity of the Australian tax system, it would have legislated in its first year to put an end to this abuse. Two weeks before the 1998 election, when the government needed money to fund the tax cuts contained in its ANTS package and when it knew Labor would raise this issue, it came out with a plan to tax trusts as companies. Eight months later, we have still not seen the legislation. But it is not just eight months since the task was put in front of it; it is three years, three months and 25 days. Perhaps the Treasurer is shooting for the record on inaction on major tax fraud. Former Fraser government Attorney-General Peter Durack left the prosecution files of the bottom of the harbour schemes in his bottom drawer for seven years. If the Liberal governmentâsurprisingly to all of the criticsâwere to win, for example, the next election, the Treasurer has a chance of beating the Durack record on inaction.</para><para>We are now being told that the government will produce its solution to this problem in the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. It is a bit more urgent than that. It has been a bit more urgent than that for more than three years. In the 1998 federal election, Labor indicated its preparedness to tax trusts as companies, so it is not a matter of political debate between the Labor and Liberal parties. The remedies on trusts are clearly set out in the ANTS package by the Treasurer. Labor wants them implemented as quickly as possible, but now the election is out of the way and the issue has been put off. Why has a policy which was clear enough to be included in the government's election policies been too difficult? Why is this the case when we have 
 been hearing regularly over a year from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about their determination to stamp out abuse in this area? On 30 September 1997 the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> reported:</para><para>The Prime Minister ruled out an attack on the abuse of trusts for taxation purposes on the spurious grounds that such a move would hurt small business.</para><para>The Prime Minister was sufficiently incensed by this to make a personal explanation to the House the same day. He said:</para><para>Can I say that I have done no such thing. What I have said, and I am happy to repeat it today, is that I have assured the members of the government parties that in any taxation changes we make we will not be acting in a manner that would seriously damage, or indeed damage at all, small business. But at no stage have I said that my government would never take action against the abuse of trusts. We will always take action against abuses within the tax system.</para><para>On 24 February 1998 the Treasurer was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>  announcing that family and company trusts would be taxed at the same rate as company profits as part of the government's crackdown on tax loopholes. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  quoted him on the same day as saying:</para><para>In an ideal tax system, taxes would relate to the economic activity that is being carried on, rather than the legal vehicle which houses that activity.</para><para>The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are very adept on this issue. They say one thing but they do nothing. Any move to stop tax evasion and avoidance always meets resistance. Someone will try to characterise the measures as draconian or claim that their activities are legitimate or essential. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  of 30 September 1998, the coalition's policy was being undermined by the Leader of the National Party even before election day with his letter of 22 September 1998 in political doublespeak to the Australian Cane Farmers Association:</para><para>I can assure you that whilst the National Party is committed to stopping any practice of `rorts' through FBT or trusts, it will take all necessary action to ensure that genuine use of distributions of capital from family trusts to beneficiaries will not be subjected to fringe benefits tax.</para><para>This contradicted the government's tax policy which said FBT would be:</para><para>. . . extended to benefits in excess of $1,000 a year provided by companies to their shareholders or by trustees to trust beneficiaries, where the benefits were not taxed currently.</para><para>There was a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  on 30 March this year, following a National Party meeting, that Senator Winston Crane was focusing his attention on preserving the rights of `legitimate' business trusts. Senator Crane claimed he had received a lot of support from his coalition colleagues. The next day AAP reported that Queensland state opposition leader Rob Borbidge had announced that the Queensland National Party would oppose any attempts to tax trusts like companies and that both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister had been told of the Queensland Nationals' position.</para><para>On 25 May 1999, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported that National Party concerns that the Review of Business Taxation proposals would reintroduce death duties on family farms by cracking down on discretionary family trusts had been given a sympathetic hearing among coalition parliamentarians. The report said it was understood the cabinet secretary, Senator Bill Heffernan, was investigating the matter further following a presentation from Queensland solicitors Cleary and Hoareâmore about Senator Heffernan in a momentâwho were representing more than 200 farmers. The National Party is apparently hoping the Review of Business Taxation will not pursue proposals to tax trusts as companies.</para><para>On 24 May, Glenn Milne reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that the Deputy Prime Minister had said, `We'll kill this in Cabinet.' Parliament has sat for several weeks since then, but there has been no personal explanation like the Prime Minister's. On the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program about a month ago, the Deputy Prime Minister was again trying to characterise taxing trusts as companies as a death duty. His exact words were:</para><para>But, at the end of the day, are we about to retrospectively reintroduce death duties by a some approach to trusts? No.</para><para>And:</para><para>The Government's made no decisions, and we still haven't got the Ralph report, and it will be a little while yet. 
</para><para>This was immediately contradicted, first by Mr Ralph, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  as saying:</para><para>We can't see where there is any negative effect arising out of proposals being considered that would give effect to an inheritance tax.</para><para>It was then contradicted by the Treasurer when he responded to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House, who asked him to:</para><para>. . . confirm that full implementation of the proposal to tax trusts as companies outlined in your original GST package had been factored into the budget surplus projections?</para><para>The Treasurer replied:</para><para>The government's policy as announced in A New Tax System, ANTS, stands. The government is proceeding to implement that. In relation to those matters that are fully costed as part of ANTS, they have of course been taken into the budget position.</para><para>The noise was coming from the National Party even before the election was over, and it is still coming today. That explains the last eight months procrastination. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are going to have to decide very soon whether their position is best summed up by an incisive comment made by the Minister for Sport and Tourism in her backbench days. On 2 October 1997, she was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  as saying:</para><para>Carmody should stop attacking Australians for not paying tax.</para><para>That sums up where the Liberal Party have been coming from for the last three years. Nor should we forget in the context of this debate that there are 20 members of the government frontbench who have trusts themselves. We saw today how this government treats conflicts of interest. We can only wait and see what the next excuse will be. Which interest groups and what misrepresentation will we see next? Meanwhile, the tax evaders and avoiders are using Australia as a tax haven and treating the rest of the community with contempt. The tax commissioner can have a good enforcement regime, but he will not be effective if the government fails to give him the tax law to do his job. Any government that lets tax avoidance and evasion of this magnitude go unchecked can never be taken seriously on tax reform.</para><para>I made a reference in my remarks to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet, Senator Bill Heffernan. We do know that about 20 out of 27 of the government frontbench have trusts.

We do know, however, that Senator Heffernan is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet, that he is the self-professed cardinal or the eyes and ears of the Prime Minister, John Howard, in the New South Wales Liberal Party and that he is a holder of six family trusts and one unit trust which he says he needs for succession planning in his family. If, under his proposal, he distributes $5,400 to each of 10 beneficiaries, due to the tax-free threshold no tax would be paid on $54,000. That should be compared to what a wage earner would have to pay on $54,000â$16,000âin tax. Not many ordinary Australian battlers get access to this level of tax avoidance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue of the use of family trusts and the interlocking nature of family trusts to split income and to lower levels of taxation are matters of considerable concern in Australia. It is about time that the government followed what the Labor government would have done had it been re-elected in 1996 and legislated in the form that Ralph Willis had announced in, as I recall, February of that year. The fact that the government sit back, fail to act and refer to it in their ANTS package but do not carry it through in their legislation giving rise to the ANTS packageâflip it off to the Ralph inquiryâindicates a degree of massive insincerity. </para><para>We will be watching very closely when the Ralph inquiry reports. We will expect the Ralph inquiry to take up the issue of tax 
 evasion and avoidance through the use of family trusts and, if it does, we will then expect this government to act quickly. We do not hold much hope that it will. While it should, in the interests of the Australian community, we are aware of the vested interests of many members of its own frontbench.

I go back to the facts. It is very rare that we are able to nail the Assistant Treasurer in a debate, because he is so slipperyâhe trades in platitudes and argues whatever is the platitudinous version of the truth. The facts are that a former Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Ralph Willis, a highly respected Australian and a well-regarded Treasurer, sought from Treasuryâand finally got from the Taxation Officeâadvice on what was occurring with family trusts and, upon receipt of that advice, acted promptly to do something about it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other fact is that the election intervened, and the advice has been sitting there for three yearsâunaddressed by this government and now the subject of consideration within the Ralph review.

However, we will wait and see what the Ralph inquiry puts, and we will be expecting the government to move promptly to end tax avoidance by the use of trusts in this manner.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>6689</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising to speak on the <inline ref="r811">A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999</inline>  and related bills I think I should begin, as is appropriate, by a declaration of interest. I have an interest in a family trust, as has been previously outlined, and I think that it is appropriate to disclose that with each bill which affects trusts coming through.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> No. 189 of 1998-99 indicates that, in 1993âwhich was the year that Paul Keating, the previous Prime Minister, won his first election in his own rightâthere were 331,000 trusts. By 1996âwhich was the 
 first year that John Howard, now the Prime Minister, won his first election in his own rightâthe number was 427,000. Those figures indicate that the number of trusts and the nature of trusts have been with us a very long time under both Labor and coalition governments, and the problems attached to them have been with us for that same period of time.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> also outlines the fact that, while the number of trusts and companies have both risen, the annual growth rate for trusts has increased while the growth rate for companies has decreased relatively. They go on to say:</para><para>The Australian Taxation Office has stated that the relative rates of growth of trusts and companies could reflect the different tax treatment of trusts and companies.</para><para>I think the `could' is a bit of a qualifier, because they do. The reason that so many Australians are in trusts is they get tax advantages as a result, and it is that area which needs serious attention. In the Ralph review preliminary report No. 2, produced, I think, by Arthur Andersen, they illustrated the fact that, in internationally comparative terms, Australia and New Zealand have a remarkably high number of trusts which operate as business entities, as opposed to the other categories of trusts, and that is because of the development in Australian law under the Labor government and continued under the coalition government of advantaging trusts in that regard. Trusts are now very much a part of many Australians' lives. Ordinary Australians invest in unit trusts, property trusts or investment trusts. There are many varieties of trusts. Of course, we all know about family trusts and the reasons for which they are constructed. But the fact is that trusts of all kinds are very heavily used by Australians.</para><para>It is the opinion of the Democrats that the  A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999  is a good advance in the direction of ensuring that trusts are appropriately taxed. These days it is often shorthand to say that trusts should be taxed as companies, but it is my opinion that we should rather say that like business activities, whether in trusts, companies, partnerships or individual operations, 
 should be taxed alike. That is probably one of the major issuesâthat, depending on the legal entity, business activity is in fact taxed differentiallyâand is something to which we hope the government will attend. The government, and everyone else, is aware that the way in which trust activities end up being taxed is at the beneficiary end and not within the entity. By and large, most trusts are not taxed at all; taxation is in the hands of the trustee or the beneficiaries, and the trust itself is a throughput mechanism. Nevertheless, I think it is still appropriate to say that business activities, regardless of the entity, should always be treated similarly.</para><para>This particular bill imposes an obligation on the trustees of closely held trusts to disclose the identity and tax file numbers of the ultimate beneficiaries of net income and tax preferred amounts. People who are not attuned to these things can sometimes skip over the meaning of that, but the ultimate beneficiary is in fact clearly defined in the closely held trust as an individual or up to 20 individuals who, between them, directly or indirectly have fixed entitlements to a 75 per cent or greater share of the income or capital of the trust. Identifying the ultimate beneficiary is in fact a great march forward in tax law, because the ultimate beneficiary in a trust has quite often, in my view, been able to slide past their tax obligation.</para><para>I notice from the financial impact statement that the Treasury calculate that this measure `is estimated to raise revenue of $30 million in each of the following financial years'. I note that the Treasury advisers are sitting in the chamber. Through you, Minister, and Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to them: I am going to guarantee to you that your estimate of $30 million is way short of the mark, and what you are introducing will in fact pinch a lot more people than that $30 million implies. I look forward to the statistics being produced in a couple of years time. I think this is going to be one of the great underestimations of how much revenue is earned, because the fact is that, through this device, you are going to be able to pin who the ultimate beneficiaries areâthey are going to have to be declared. It is always worthwhile, Minister, as a govern 
 ment and as a Treasury to underestimate your future revenue stream. I think you are pretty safe on this one. I think this bill goes a lot further than people have woken up to.</para><para>To continue with the nature of the bill itself, the bill does provide that, if the trustee fails to notify the tax department of the ultimate beneficiary or if there is no ultimate beneficiaryâand such a thing is hard to conceiveâit can provide for taxation at a penalty rate or for offences under the Income Tax Act. Those penalties and offences are outlined in the bill and include the trustee being liable to pay the tax or, if the trustee is a company, the directors being also jointly and severally liable to pay tax. I notice there are fines under section 8C of the TAA `not exceeding $2,000 for the first offence, increasing to $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months for subsequent offences'. So there are some quite sharp penalties for failure to disclose these things. We then notice that, within the content of the bill, the ultimate beneficiary characteristics are defined quite tightly. The various mechanisms are carried through in consequential amendments to other bills.</para><para>I do not choose to say much more, Minister, other than I think that this is quite an effective bill. I think there is lots more to come on the trusts area, and the government has indicated that in the ANTS package. It is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that this bill should be strongly supported as one of the first tranches of legislation which will tighten up an area which badly needs tightening. Accordingly, as you will have recognised from my remarks, we will support the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>6690</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak to the Labor Party amendment on sheet 1460, as circulated.

Treasury and the tax office are left struggling, trying to fill in the loopholes. Here was their chance for a bit of integrity in the tax package. Here was the government's chance to say to the Labor Party, `You will never be able to taunt us about family trusts again.'

In the case of some senators in this chamber, it is as much courage as standing up in front of your microphone and talking on a bill. It is disappointing that they come in, they hurl the gutter insults around, and then they turn round and walk out of the chamber. But I guess we are used to it from some of the senators in this chamber. If you have managed to clock up an entire 15 minutes since you became a parliamentary secretaryâ15 
 minutes in eight monthsâI guess you are entitled to just wander in and out of the chamber and be the eyes and ears. But no, you reckon you are an expert on an issue, you are lobbying behind the scenes, you have more family trusts than you can count on one handâyou are entitled to lobby privately.

Then, when you get meaningful opportunity, Treasury squibs it and government squibs it. The last hope in the line here was the Democrats, and they squibbed it as well. It is disappointing. I know that many of the people listening tonight will be shaking their heads and saying, `Well, what happened to the Democrats? They used to believe in social justice. They used to believe in meaningful tax reform. They used to care about the people downtrodden in our society. They used to represent those sorts of values.' But for a few trinkets, a few beads and blankets, the Democrats were willing to give it up. The microphones are available any time any senator wants to come back into the chamber. Rather than stick their head in the door and run away again, they have the microphone here. Twenty minutes is available for any senator who wants to come into the chamber right now, after I sit down.</para><para>It is a great disappointment to see where the Democrats have got to on this.

Senator Conroy rambled on, constantly repeating himself and filling up time, I might say, on the totally mistaken assumption that this debate was being broadcast. Didn't anyone tell Senator Conroy that it is not being broadcast? Had they done so, we might have saved ourselves a 20-minute ramble.

It reflects rather badly on you, Senator Conroy. We know that you have your eye on Senator Faulkner's chair. After his performance in recent years there is clearly a vacancy going for the leadership of the opposition in the Senate. But even you will have to up your game, Senator, before you are able to achieve that prize. I thought there was some chance that you might have achieved this in the short run.

The trouble is that the Labor Party has got form. Even worse, from your point of view, Senator Collins, the Labor Party is completely irrelevant to major policy in this country. You ducked the challenge on tax reform. We are all waiting to see your approach to the Ralph reforms. Given Senator Conroy's performance todayâI think he is your leading spokesman in this areaâyou would not hold out any hopes. You would not hold out any hopes at all that a sensible policy position will emerge from the Labor Party. That is a great pity for the Labor Party, but it is a sad reflection on what was once a party that enjoyed some community respect. Now it is just a joke. It has a leader who is a joke.

These measures are meant to counter practices where entitlements pass through a series of trusts. For instance, part or all of the net income of a trust may be passed through a series of trusts with no ultimate beneficiary being assessed on that income, either because there is no ultimate beneficiary or because the ultimate beneficiary cannot be identified. Other assets of a trust may be said to be distributed through a series of trusts, yet the assets may never be reflected in the assets of any ultimate beneficiary, or there may be taxpayers whose assets are said to reflect trust distributions which cannot be traced back to the succession of trusts to which they are ascribed.</para><para>To control the use of such trusts to avoid tax, these bills require trustees of closely held trusts with trustee beneficiaries to disclose to the Commissioner of Taxation the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries of a trust net income and taxed preferred amounts to which another trust is entitled. The commissioner needs this information to check that the beneficiary who should do so has included his or her share of the net income of the trust in his or her assessable income for the year and to make sure that a beneficiary's assets include any tax preferred amounts which should be included. To reduce compliance costs, a certain number of closely held trusts, such as compliant superannuation funds and deceased estates, have been excluded from the measure.</para><para>Furthermore, a trustee need trace an entitlement to net income no further than any range of listed persons, including exempt bodies, charitable trusts and widely held trusts. This also reduces compliance costs. Where a trustee does not give the necessary information in relation to net income of the trust, the bills will impose tax on the trustee in relation 
 to that part of the net income at the top marginal rate plus Medicare levy. If a trustee of a closely held trust does not give the required information about a tax preferred amount, the trustee may be guilty of an offence. We will of course not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>âThere is a second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook on behalf of the opposition.

Mr Foley, as a CASA board member, had participated in the development and approval of a new management structure for the authority. That process created a number of new senior positions. Mr Foley participated in the selection of a recruitment agency to assist CASA in filling those positions. He was also a candidate for one of those positions, but he did not declare an interest.</para></talk.start><para>As I told the Senate last week, at a board meeting on 15 May the process to be followed in interviewing candidates for these jobs and the role of the board in that process were discussed. The process was to involve a number of panels with a member of the board sitting on each panel. Mr Foley told the board he was not able to participate in that process 
 but did not advise his fellow board members as to why he was unavailable.</para><para>In fact, Mr Foley did not advise the Chairman, Mr Smith, that he was a candidate for the position of Assistant Director, Air Safety Compliance, until 4 June. That was several months after he had discussions with Spencer Stuart about a possible jobâSpencer Stuart being the headhunter consultant being used to fill the vacant positions. It was one month after he had met with the CASA recruitment firm to discuss his candidacy and one monthâless two daysâafter he told Spencer Stuart he was an applicant for the position of Assistant Director, Air Safety Compliance. It was nearly three weeks after he had declined to participate in the staff selection process but had omitted to tell anyone he was a candidate in that process. Mr Foley then waited a further three weeks before he formally tendered his resignation to the minister.</para><para>This process is in sharp contrast to the Auditor-General's corporate code of conduct. The Auditor-General said the behaviour of the board affects the integrity, ethics, values and other aspects of corporate culture. What sort of integrity, what sorts of ethics and what sorts of values are conveyed to CASA employees by the manner in which Mr Foley conducted himself?</para><para>The CASA board has been quick to criticise some staff for being too close to the industry they regulate. Dick Smith and Mr Toller used terms like `mateship' and `cronyism' when talking about their own staff at the February estimates committee hearings. I do not have to ask what CASA staff think of the manner in which Mr Foley was appointed to a job worth at least $150,000 a year. I do not have to ask what they think of the role played by Mr Willoughby, Mr Smith and possibly others in the creation and filling of a senior management position with one of their own. I know what they think of it.</para><para>I now wish to advise the Senate of the actual selection process followed that led to the appointment of Mr Foley. Spencer Stuart advertised these positions in the national press on 1 and 2 May last year. They received 61 applications. Five applicants were short-listed and, according to Mr Toller, three candidates 
 were interviewed. Two were interviewed on or before 24 Mayâwhich was a Sundayâand Mr Foley was not interviewed until 1 July. Mr Toller told the committee he interviewed one of the candidates, and possibly both, prior to receiving a report from the recruitment firm. He did not explain why he chose to do the interview prior to getting expert advice from Spencer Stuart. He did say he was asked by Mr Smith to interview one candidate and he did so.</para><para>Although Mr Toller alone interviewed the three candidates for the Foley positionâat his initiativeâhe did not look at the original list of applicants or even at an intermediate list. He only received the short list of three candidates. He did, however, see an intermediate list for all of the other positions. I think there were at least three other positions being filled at the same time. The selection panel for the other positions consisted of Mr Toller, a board member, Mr Willoughby and Mr Wheatley from Spencer Stuart.</para><para>Despite the fact that Mr Toller had interviewed two of the three candidates for the Foley job on or about 24 May, it was not until 17 Juneâthree weeks laterâthat Mr Willoughby provided the board with a list of all candidates for all positions and summaries of the leading contenders. Mr Foley was not included in that mail-out. As I said, Mr Toller interviewed Mr Foley on 1 July. Mr Foley was advised on 1 Julyâthe same dayâthat he had been successful in his application. That appointment, and Mr Foley's resignation from the CASA board, was announced on 3 July.</para><para>Despite earlier advice from Mr Toller that there were only three candidates on the short list for the Foley position, there were in fact five. It is not clear who the other short-listed candidates were or why they were not interviewed. There were also two other candidates for the Foley position. Mr Toller thought they were not on the short list of five but Mr Wheatley and Mr Willoughby interviewed them both on the afternoon of 26 June. One was a senior CASA officer from Darwin and the other a senior CASA officer from Adelaide. Both, before they attended the interviews, sought a clear statement that they were 
 being considered for the job. Neither wanted to spend hours in an aircraftâone was flying from Darwin to Canberraâif they were only going to be used to legitimise the interview process.</para><para>But that is exactly what happened. Both candidates flew in for the interview. One was interviewed at 2.30 p.m. and the other at 3 p.m. and that was itâhalf-hour interviews. Mr Toller said the headhunter advised that neither candidate was up to the mark. The committee was told these candidates were interviewed as a result of a decision of the CASA board. I asked whether that decision was minuted. I was assisted at the estimates hearings by Mr Elder, an officer of CASA, who told me that he did not think it was. He said that the decision was possibly taken in a closed or private session. He said:</para><para>It would not always be minuted.</para><para>Somewhat surprised by that answer, I then asked, `If the board makes a decision, it is a decision, and presumably the board decisions are minuted.' Mr Toller replied:</para><para>No, not all decisions. The board makes formal decisions and the board makes informal decisions. All resolutions of the board will be minuted, but informal decisions will not necessarily be minuted.</para><para>I then asked what status informal decisions had. I was told that, if they were board decisions and all board members abided by them, they had the power of the boardâwhatever that means. Mr Elder said that, as far as board decisions taken outside the formal process are concerned, if the board wished to have a decision minuted for the formal record they would advise him and he would record it.</para><para>The CASA board has a two-tier system of decision making: a formal decision making process that is minuted, and an informal decision making process that is not minuted. This sits very awkwardly with Mr Barrett's rules. Based on the evidence from both Mr Toller and Mr Elder, minutes from CASA board meetings do not accurately record outcomes from meetings; those minutes only record some decisions. Under such a system, how can the board be properly held accountable for decisions it takes if they are not all recorded? </para><para>My own recent experience allows me to illustrate this point very simply. On 21 July last year I asked a question on noticeâquestion No. 1248âabout Mr Foley's application for, and appointment to, the position of Assistant Director. An answer to that question was never provided to me through the normal channels. I actually received a copy of the answer via a freedom of information request. Clearly, the answer was held back in the minister's office. The answer that was prepared contained an error. The error was detected by CASA and corrected. Mr Elder, then General Manager, Corporate Relations, wrote to Carol Boughton, Assistant Secretary, Aviation Industry Division of the department, on 13 October.</para><para>The first version of the answer stated the recruitment firm Spencer Stuart had approached Mr Foley on 5 June 1998 and that Mr Foley had agreed to be considered for the position on 7 June. Those dates put the contact between Mr Foley and the recruitment firm one day after he told the board of his intention to apply for the job. Mr Elder advised that the dates should read 5 May and 7 Mayâa month before the board was advised of his intention. An ungenerous person might conclude that this answer was designed to deceive. A generous person might conclude that CASA's records were inaccurate or incomplete.</para><para>In the estimates hearings Mr Toller was also forced to correct another error in that answer No. 1248. The answer claimed that Mr Toller and Mr Willoughby conducted interviews for the Foley position. As we know, Mr Toller alone conducted those three interviews. The same ungenerous person might see this as another attempt to mislead and the same generous person might conclude there were further inaccuracies or omissions in CASA records. Mr Elder was also forced to write to the committee to correct an answer about the timing of the board meeting at which Mr Willoughby proposed a process to select candidates.

It has been a very great privilege to serve this chamber and through this chamber to serve the nation. I want to thank sincerely those senators who mentioned me for their words the other night. As we go through life we learn by experience and many views change. One idea that I had when I entered the Senate still remains with me, though, and that is that there are more than enough good men and women in this parliament to form a very able government. The problem is that they are not concentrated in any one party.</para></talk.start><para>I would also like to thank all the staff of the parliament for the courtesy and support they have unfailingly shown me over the yearsâthe clerks, the secretariat staff, the attendants and everyone else. Their dedication to this institution is beyond reproach.</para><para>The subject I want to raise tonight concerns the performance of some officers in the Department of Defence at the recent Senate estimates hearings. Several points need to be addressed, and they are all serious. The first point relates to the way Defence has handled safety measures in relation to the Collins submarine. I raised a question on this in the previous hearings in relation to the V31 valve incident. It must be emphasised that this is a question, not a statement of fact. This valve is a valve which connects the interior, the bilge of the submarine, to the outside ocean. Naturally it is closed when the submarine has dived. For safety reasons, it is controlled by two systems. Beyond a certain depth a depth sensor, or transducer, prevents the valve being 
 opened, and that system cannot be overridden by human control. At a shallow depth it can be overridden by human control. The internal side of the valve is connected to pipes. It is not simply just a hole through the hull, as a somewhat hysterical officer tried to infer at the hearings.</para><para>My question is very simple: was there ever a fault in the fail-safe mechanism, as has been alleged? The parliament is entitled to an answer to that question, and a clear answer of yes or no has never been given. We hear a lot of bluster from Navy about how stringent their submarine safety procedures are. If that is so, why the difficulty in giving a simple answer to a simple question? While on the subject of safety, can I put on the record another safety question, again not a statement of fact. I ask: was the sub safe system completely bypassed in 1997 when HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Collins</inline> went to sea and dived with the fore planes inoperable due to a hydraulic fault? Did the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff have to order <inline font-style="italic">Collins</inline> to surface and return to harbour? Again the question requires a simple yes or no: did it happen? With only two hydroplanes on the fin and with both locked in the neutral position, if this did happen, it could only be described as a reckless and foolhardy action. Again, if it did occur, how did it get past the sub safe process?</para><para>I want to make it clear in public that I have no hesitation at all about being concerned for the lives of service personnel. I deplore very much the policy of Navy to attack anyone who raises safety issues on the grounds that it causes needless emotional distress to crews' families. I will not be silenced by such crude methods. Had those of us who knew the operational shortcomings of Army aviation prior to the Black Hawk tragedy been more vigorous in our criticism in public, perhaps that tragedy may never have occurred, and that is a matter that is on my conscience.</para><para>Finally, let me turn to another act of Defence that was quite unworthy of them. That is the assertion that we cannot have any leading edge technologies, and we cannot therefore have the best military equipment in the world, unless we take high risks, and risks mean that we have the situation we are in 
 with the Collins program at the present time. It is quite wrong to use ambition as a cloak for inadequacies and inefficiencies in management. Yes, we do want the best technology, and we all recognise and accept that there are risks involved in going down that path. There is simply no way of making progress in human affairs without taking risks. What critics object to is that the Defence acquisitions department have no risk management strategy in place. In fact, they do not even recognise that they do not have a policy. When troubles come, they do not take the appropriate action at the time. They pretend it is not occurring and hope it all goes away. When it becomes public, as it always will, they move belatedly into damage control. We have potentially a good submarine in the Collins class submarine. The problems we have with it are real, and they demand real management skills to overcome them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenwich University</title><page.no>6701</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6701</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis afternoon we were discussing a Privileges Committee report concerning complaints from a number of academics who had written to the Privileges Committee concerned about statements that had been made involving Greenwich University.

Senator Tierney asks me if I have prepared an apology. I indicate to Senator Tierney that, given the investigation that is under way as a result of the concerns that have been expressed by me, by vice-chancellors and by state governments, and given the concerns expressed by the Minister for Tertiary Education and Training in the state of Victoriaâwho said on 6 May that he was very concerned about the lack of rigorous processes of review, compared with those carried out by the states, before recognition was given to Greenwich 
 University by the parliament of Norfolk IslandâI would have thought that the only apology that is going to be prepared is one by the Prime Minister to the people of Australia concerning the incompetence and buffoonery of his ministers in allowing this disgraceful episode to go on for as long as it has.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I indicated this afternoon that in America there is a view that a thousand flowers ought to bloom in higher education, but in my judgment we might not want some of these to take root in Australia, or we might never want to plant them here in the first place. I have expressed the concern that our university system guards its reputation jealously, for very good cause. It has a reputation built up on the basis of an intellectual tradition of academic rigour built on the well-established empirical, rational and historical intellectual frameworks of science, letters and the arts. While there are important differences between our universities, what holds them together is this common sense of quality assurance and this commitment to rigour.</para><para>What is established here is a tradition which generalises the reputation for quality, which reaches right across the Australian higher education system. I think this is why we have been so spectacularly successful in developing an education export industry worth over $3 billion a year. On a per capita basis it is probably much greater than that of the United States. Even though here in the antipodes we are latecomers to the international education arena, we nonetheless have streaked ahead as a result of this commitment to quality. What I am concerned about is that prospective students from overseas should know that an Australian degree will be recognised worldwideâthat a professional qualification from an Australian university will open doors wherever it is used. It will be held up everywhere that because it is an Australian university degree it is a matter of substance and quality.</para><para>I suggest that this has now changed, and this is the question that is brought into stark relief by the actions of the Norfolk Island legislature that were directed and approved by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories 
 and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald. He has brought an intruder of doubtful provenance into our midst. This one act has the potential to bring down the entire edifice of Australian higher education in terms of its international reputation. It is unfortunate that Australia's lack of a robust standard of accreditation procedures has left us as what can be described as sitting ducks for the interlopers from cyberspace, for these so-called virtual universities. We simply do not have a regulatory framework to deal with this problem. The Internet has managed to elude the many safeguards that currently exist for the rest of the university system.</para><para>The ACCC has prosecuted the case of another charlatan institution in recent timesâthat is, the Australasian Institute, which is registered on the Caribbean island of Grenada. The institute has been found guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct. The court has ordered this institution to cease advertising its web based degree and to stop making false claims. It can no longer seek student enrolments.</para><para>Australia's laws leave us wide open under the present arrangements. Our company law and education regulation measures are woefully inadequate to deal with these contemporary problems. By means of the Trade Practices Act, the Federal Court can take retrospective action, but it cannot stop shonky outfits from setting up in the first place. The government is trying to repair the damage done by the establishment of Greenwich University itself. It is worth while asking how this entity managed to slip through the safety net so easily.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>âWhere's your proof?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âIt would seem that we have an answer.

At the same time, it has made no secret of the fact that it is a virtual institution to which the national and physical borders of the island and its coastline are absolutely irrelevant.

My opposition was not about whether or not I have a philosophical objection to a GST. I have always willingly supported the platform which the Democrats took to the last election and the position and recommendations that the party put forward in its Senate committee report on that package of bills.</para></talk.start><para>My basic concern is that the final legislation still risks making our tax system more regressive than it currently is, despite the significant improvements which have been made to it by the Australian Democrats. Changing the structure of our tax system so that it relies more heavily on indirect taxes makes it more difficult to ensure just outcomes. I recognise that some of my colleagues genuinely believe differently on this 
 matter, and I note the very significant improvements in both fairness and environmental outcomes which have been negotiated by people within the parliamentary wing of the Australian Democrats.</para><para>This package passed regardless of my vote of course but I do take my responsibilities as an individual member of parliament and as a Democrat very seriously. I cannot vote for something that I am fundamentally opposed to and it is obviously up to the voters of Queensland and to Democrat members to pass judgment on my actions on this issue. I am appreciative of the repeated statements from my parliamentary colleagues and from the Democrat membership respecting and supporting my right to vote in accordance with my beliefs on this matter. I had certainly consulted widely with Democrat members and supporters, particularly in Queensland, prior to reaching this decision. I do urge all members of the Democrats to recognise that the party's core principles have not changed and to recognise that the Democrats still represent the strongest vehicle in Australian politics to achieve significant social, economic and environmental advancement.</para><para>Voting separately from my parliamentary leader is not something that I do lightly, nor something that I expect to do often. Despite the views expressed by some political commentators, I do not believe the taxation agreements should be seen as signalling an ideological shift by the Australian Democrats. Every change that the Democrats forced to the original tax package was driven by concern for greater social equity or environmental protection. This demonstrates very clearly that the Democrats have used and will continue to use our balance of power role to pursue the party's core aims as strongly as ever.</para><para>As a Queenslander I had some specific concerns about the employment impacts of the GST, especially on the tourism industry, a major employer in my own state. I was also concerned about the potential loss of extra revenue in the clearly identified revenue stream which would have been provided to local government in Queensland. I recognise and understand the concerns that many people have about the large increase which will be 
 provided in subsidies for fossil fuel usage. However, I would urge environmentalists to examine the package as a whole and to consider just how significant some of the changes which the Democrats have forced will be. The significance of the long-term improvements which the Democrats have gained in the environmental area should not be underestimated, and I urge all people to look at the detailed analysis that has been provided by all different sources.</para><para>The Democrats have forced the coalition government to take environmental concerns seriously and have made environmental issues a central component of the national political agenda for the first time in many years. This is a significant achievement, one which, as the party's  environment spokesperson, I look forward to building on in coming months. Any governmentâand indeed any partyâwhich takes environmental issues seriously and seeks to achieve constructive and positive moves forward is more likely to receive the Democrats' support.</para><para>I have already expressed my concern about the potential impact of the GST on non-profit organisations. As I am sure all senators would acknowledge, the non-profit sector plays an invaluable role in the community both socially and economically and it is already considerably underresourced. I know work is ongoing to minimise and eliminate the potential threat to that sector. I know all of my party colleagues will be focused on ensuring that outcome and I will certainly be working along with them to achieve that goal. I have also expressed concerns in this chamber about the potential impact of the tax changes on housing costs, an area I have had some involvement in over many years and again one that I will certainly continue to monitor.</para><para>I have spent most of the last nine or more years of my life holding a variety of senior positions within the Democrats, encouraging the party to be more pragmatic. I have never been someone who believes the party should only support initiatives that represent 100 per cent of party policies and should refuse to support anything that does not go the whole way. I am happy to support anything that moves, in even a small way overall, towards 
 achieving Democrat policy and principles. I urge all those who do have concerns with what the Democrat parliamentary party has negotiated with the government to recognise that those in the party who are able to support the package do so because of a genuine belief that it is best for Australia and it meets the basic aims and direction of Democrat policy and principles.</para><para>In my first speech to the Senate, I spoke at length about the central and crucial role which the members of the Australian Democrats play in sustaining and building the party and the broader social movement which it represents. Perhaps more than any other party the Democrats rely on member input and involvement and celebrate that. As I said in that first speech, few us from any party in this chamber and certainly none of us in the Democrats would be here in parliament without the `selfless dedication and commitment of countless people who contribute so much of their own time, money and energy simply because they believe in the ideals and policies of the party'.</para><para>It is no secret that some members of the Democrats are unhappy with the taxation legislation. People holding different views is not unusual in any sizeable organisation and the Democrats have always recognised and promoted the importance of diversity. I make a special plea to those members who are concerned to recognise this fact and to stay with the party. Our core principles remain and only by those members' continued involvement will we be able to ensure that the goals, objectives and principles of the party are retained. As I said in this chamber last week, if one were to follow the rationale of Senator Bob Brown and resign from a party every time one disagreed with a decision, one would soon end upâlike himâin a party of one.</para><para>The Democrats have always believed in accommodating and encouraging a diversity of views within the framework of our overall principles. Those core principles have not changed and we need all our members to stay on board and to increase their involvement to ensure that they do not change. The party is now moving into a position of greater power and we need even more involvement and 
 support from our members to ensure we exercise that power responsibly and effectively. Now is the time for even greater member input to take advantage of the extra power and responsibilities which the Democrats hold. I call on all members not to drop out but to pitch in even further.</para><para>In the brief amount of time left, I would like to mention brieflyâand pay tribute toâa Queensland member, a typical example of the people I mentioned previously who gave so much of their own time and energy because they believed in the partyâa person called Steve Hunter, who tragically died a week ago. Steve was the Secretary of the Democrats' Logan Branch, just south of Brisbane, for a number of years. Steve put a great deal of effort into keeping that branch going through a low ebb in that branch's history, certainly ensuring that the branch was able to go on to stronger things since. I pass on my commiserations to his family and I say thank you to Steve for all he contributed to the party.</para><para>I would also like to wish well all those senators who are retiring from this place in a couple of days time. Although I have not had a great deal to do with Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Synon, I certainly wish them well. Four senators from Queensland are moving onâa significant proportion of my state's representation will be changing over in a few days time. Senator MacGibbon, who spoke before, is well recognised for his contribution over many years in the areas of defence and foreign affairs in particular. Senator Reynolds is widely respected amongst many Democrat supporters for her strong stance on, particularly, indigenous issues, environment issues and women's issues, among others. I wish Senator Colston well. He is certainly someone who contributed a lot in the area of procedure within the Senate and in some of those less well-known committees such as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee which still play an important role. Senator O'Chee is someone whom I have also had experience with in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and I got a clearer insight into the importance of that committee. Whilst I do not necessarily agree with a lot he says, I certainly feel that the way he says 
 things is  a helluva lot better than I will ever manage. He is one of the better public speakers I have seen. Finally, farewell to Senator Margetts. These days it is probably not as great a comfort to a Green party person to get a tribute from the Democrats as it might have been a few weeks ago, but I do acknowledge the very considerable contribution she has made. I have great respect for the quality and the integrity of her work, and she is certainly an example I will look to into the future. I wish her well in her future endeavours.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenwich University</title><page.no>6706</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6706</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight with the second speech relating to Greenwich University.

Senator Carr, you have chalked up and wasted the time of this chamber on a totally useless pursuit in which you have denigrated people's good names. You have put on the public record the besmirching of an institution which does have, as I will prove yet again tonight, on a second occasion, quite a good reputation overseas with the students who are graduatesâto whom I will refer to in a minuteâwith associated staff of the university, and with those who have been subject to the work of that university.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Tonight I want to focus in particular on Senator Carr's comments on curriculum. His speech more recently related to the staff, and I did respond to that. The staff have written to me, greatly dismayed that their names have been dragged through the mud in this place and have been besmirched. That is causing them great trauma and problems in their own lives, and they have written to me about that. I also commend them for taking matters into 
 their own hands by writing to the Privileges Committee of this Senate and have referred Senator Carr to the Privileges Committee. The Privileges Committee today directed that the letters which these people have used to defend their own reputations be incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record, something which I did try to do during the last speech but was denied by Senator Carr. I was going to try to incorporate them tonight, but that has already been done by the Privileges Committee, and I thank the committee for that.</para><para>Tonight I want to focus on the curriculum of Greenwich, something that Senator Carr, through his various questions speeches and comments in estimates, has chosen to denigrate. Senator Carr, what do you think of these courses, and do you think they have an appropriate place in a university: comparative approaches to mysticism, history of tourism and travel, Confuscian politics in a rocky mountain world, sex and scandal, post-colonialism, gender and sexuality, andâone that is right up your alley, Senator Carrâsocialist law?</para><para>I ask Senator Carr: in the proper role of universities, are these proper academic studies? I wonder what your response is. Is this the curriculum of Greenwich University I am reading out? No. What I am reading from is the curriculum of the University of Sydneyâa university with a top reputation in this country. I am not denigrating the University of Sydney; I am trying to prove to you that you cannot judge the academic rigour of a course by its title. That is exactly what Senator Carr has sought to do on a number of occasions in this Senateâhe has taken the title and poked fun at it. The reason is that he does not understand the leading edges of knowledge, particularly the leading edges of interdisciplinary knowledge, in modern academic study.</para><para>Rather than my making a statement here in judgment of the programs of the university, I think we should hear from the people involved. From Ian Mackechnie, we have this comment on the debate in the Senate on Greenwich University:</para><para>Congratulations to Senator Tierney for his outspoken response to Senator Carr's continuous lies and 
 falsehoods peddled under the privilege of parliament.</para><para>As both a graduate of Greenwich and one who has been closely attached to the university, its staff and its faculty over many years, I can assure Senator Tierney, Carr, Kemp, the Prime Minister and anyone else who is willing to listen to the facts that Greenwich has a reputation, credibility and standards that would exceed most Australian universities. And I can say that through personal experience, having studied through several Australian universities.</para><para>A comment from a student:</para><para>As a September 1998 Ph.D. graduate of Greenwich, I am compelled to offer the following as it relates to my educational experience as a Greenwich student:</para><para>First, I am a retired U.S. Navy Captain and, for the last 8 years have been involved in the education of adult learners . . .</para><para>He says that he has degrees from three universities in the United States and enrolled in the PhD course at Greenwich University. He continues:</para><para>. . . I did a considerable amount of research before deciding to enrol in a non-traditional degree awarding institution. Since my workday is routinely a 10-12 hour one, with a considerable amount of travel required, coupled with the fact that . . . I had 3 children at home under the age of 16, it was impractical for me to pursue a Ph.D. in a traditional institution. My research involved review of Greenwich's program by several respected educators. Each of these individuals stated that short of a residency requirement, the university met the standard for most doctoral degree requirements. In addition to the favourable comments of these individuals, the credentials of Greenwich University adjunct faculty particularly impressed me.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>All three courses in my dissertation were completed in my own time in 18 months.

</para><para>Finally, I would like to turn to comments that I think sum up Senator Carr's appalling ignorance of the academic world and how you judge standards. I will allow his words to deliver the coup de grace on this matter. This is from Dr Claudine Jeanrenaud. He is well-read in the field of depth psychology. Do you know what that is, Senator Carr? I doubt it. Senator Carr has advertised his ignorance of this field of psychology. That psychology is based on the work of Carl Jung. Do you know who Carl Jung is, Senator Carr? He is the famous Swiss psychologist, second only in the world to Freud. He writes on 5 April:</para><para>Next time he, Senator Carr, plans to endeavour in the smashing of an entire body of academic studies, he better do his homework first, for surely he didn't intend to demonstrate his ignorance to the whole world.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Racial Discrimination</title><page.no>6707</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>6707</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the issue of racial discrimination. All senators in this place are aware of racial discrimination. We have read about it in the newspapers or have heard about some form of discrimination based on the colour of a person's skin, the language they speak or their country of origin. But how many of us have ever experienced it first-hand? How many of us have ever personally known somebody who has been a victim of racism? I am sure most senators have. I would like to share with the Senate tonight an experience I had recently which upset me greatly.</para></talk.start><para>A friend of mine who, by the way, has white skinânot that it matters at all; of course, it should never matterâand speaks English as her first language became aware that the differential treatment she had received for the past few years in her workplace was actually racially driven. It was based purely on her country of origin and the way she spoke. Throughout the years of her employment, she always gave 150 per cent effort in whatever she did, because that is the kind of person she is, but she was very rarely ever given the recognition her work deserved.</para><para>She was always denied access to any pay rises, even though she knew that many of her colleagues had received pay increases on a 
 regular basis. When she finally asked for a pay increase, she was told, `You were not worth what you were getting when you started, but you are now; so forget it.' Even with four years experience behind her, she was still getting the same rate of pay as a new starter and, even two years further down the track, she remained on that same level. Even though this was always a puzzle to her, she got on with the job because she loved what she did so passionately. Ironically, she worked in a job that was for the benefit of others.</para><para>The simple fact of the matter was that the person at the top of the organisation had a problem with her accent and the confidence that women from her country of origin portrayed. Recently all was revealed by one of her colleagues at her farewell function, where she was told that the problem between her and the boss had always been that he could never get over the way she spoke and that he regarded the women from her country of origin to be all the sameâto his way of thinking, aggressive and forceful. This simple statement cut right to the core of her very soul, as the truth of the matter began to sink in. Looking back over the years at the barriers and obstacles she had had to deal with on a constant basis with this job, the true realisation that she had been the victim of racial discrimination was almost too much to bear.</para><para>Then the final blow came when she confided in another of her colleagues as to what had been said and discovered that it was common knowledge amongst the workplace but that no-one would dare say anything to her because they did not want to hurt her feelings. For many years she had been the brunt of jokes from many of her coworkers about the way she pronounced certain words, but had just laughed along with everyone else in the hope that, if she did not react, it would soon stop, all the while secretly wishing they would stop and had even attempted to alter the way she spoke. But even through all of this, she never suspected that this could be racially driven or that her so-called friends and coworkers could be aware of what was happening and actively partake in such demeaning behaviour.</para><para>As we sat there having a quiet drink she told me what had happened. I could visibly see the pain it caused her, as the tears began to well in her eyesâit had all become too real. I was horrified to think that someone I knew had been the victim of such disgusting behaviour. She was being discriminated against not only on the basis of how she spoke but also because she happened to come from a country where the women are taught to be confident in their own abilities.</para><para>It brings to light the ugly realisation of how deeply entrenched racial discrimination has become with regard to some people's behaviour in today's society. I think the worst part of all this is that these people are all good people and probably do not even realise what they have done. I am quite sure that, if you asked many of them, they would claim they were not racist. We pride ourselves in this country on the fact that we live in a multicultural society, and we like to think that we are civilised and tolerant of all newcomers to Australia, who come here because they want a better way of life. Indeed, I myself am a migrant, as most senators would know, and I believe that I have had a better life and far more opportunities in Australia than I would have had in the country of my birth. I very much doubt that, if I had stayed in the country of my birth, I would today have been in the House of Lords. I am damn sure I would not be.</para><para>This is a disturbing story. I do not believe the majority of Australians are racist or intolerant, even with the rise of the One Nation Party, which I believe did attract as their followers many of the rednecks in our society. Let's face it, in all societies there is this redneck element. I would hope that this is an isolated incident. If we encounter this sort of disgraceful behaviour I think it is up to all of us, in any job or from any walk of life, to point out to the perpetrator the hurt he or she is causing because of his or her personal bias. Probably this sort of person should not have been in a position of authority. Surely an employee should be judged on the merit of their work, not on their accent.</para><para>Senators, I ask you to consider this: if a person who looks the same and speaks the 
 same language as any average Australian can become a victim of racism, what must it be like for a person who has a different skin colour or differently shaped eyes or who has difficulty with the English language? What must that person have to put up with? What my friend encountered was discrimination not only towards her nationality but also against her gender. There is no place for this in a civilised society. Thank goodness it is not widespread, otherwise many of us in this chamber today would not be in the positions of employment that we currently enjoy.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Choice of Fund</title><page.no>6709</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>6709</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rarely speak during the adjournment debate; I think it is almost three years since I have done so. I come to this adjournment tonight only because I think there are a couple of important things that need to be said, particularly in relation to the fact that a number of the government's reform agenda items have been pushed past 30 June because of the intensity of the legislation presented to the parliament in this first session.</para></talk.start><para>I want to talk particularly about superannuation and the choice of funds in superannuation. Superannuation fund choice is an important public reform agenda item. Contrary to the views of some parties that would wish the issue to go away, it is still on the agenda. It is important that those who make legislation in Australia not be distracted by those who are in the business of protecting their own patch. It is always more instructive in these matters to look to what dispassionate players have to say about issues.</para><para>Let us take, for example, the Wallis inquiry into our financial system. Wallis was given the task of reporting on how our financial system could be better regulated and more able to achieve economies and cost savings. It reported that the cost to the users of the financial services industry is about $41 billion, or a little under 10 per cent of GDP. They presented to the government a package of reforms that will ultimately have the impact of driving down the cost of savings and investment in Australia. Wallis has made far-reaching recommendations, many of which 
 have already been the subject of legislation that has passed through this Senate.</para><para>Superannuation fund choice was one of the areas pursued by Wallis. The inquiry found that, in relation to superannuation consumers, over half were in funds where members were unlikely to have been offered full choice. In fact, Wallis was advised by the then ISC that about 24 per cent of fund members have no choice of fund at all. This position is surely at odds with other services and goods that are chosen every day by consumersâfor example, banking and home loans. Individuals can go to a bank, a building society, a credit union or a mortgage originator and choose a service that suits their needs. The choice of home mortgage funds is one of the reasons behind the dramatic reductions in housing interest rates.</para><para>If a mortgage provider is charging interest rates that are above the market rates, the consumer can switch to another mortgage provider. In superannuation the position for the consumer is dramatically different. If, for example, the superannuation consumer is experiencing rates of return that are poor under the current regime, they like it or lump it. There are certain players in the superannuation industry who continue to mouth paternalistically that consumers are not ready to choose where their retirement savings should be directed. Is it that they want to continue their monopolistic control of the complexities of superannuation? Or is it that they are just protecting existing commercial interests?</para><para>If their logic were consistent, they would be saying that individuals on the receiving end of employment benefits amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars should be denied the right to choose an annuity or a rollover vehicle. Could you imagine the outcry if this were government policy? The opponents of choice have not taken and do not take this stand, because the prudential and disclosure controls that we have are sound and have not given rise to market failure. These controls are almost identical to those which would be applicable if fund choice were to proceed. So it is rather refreshing to read and take note of the more independent 
 observers and what they might have to say about choice. In its 88th recommendation the Wallis inquiry said:</para><para>Employees should be provided with choice of fund, subject to any constraints about administrative costs and fund liquidity. Where superannuation benefits vest in a member, that member should have the right to transfer the amounts to any complying fund. Where a member chooses to exercise that right, payments should be transferred to the chosen fund as soon as practicable, subject to controls necessary to maintain orderly management for the benefit of all fund members.</para><para>Transfer costs, including those incurred as a result of regulatory requirements, should be transparent and reasonable.</para><para>However, Wallis is now two years old, and we still do not have any semblance of choice in our superannuation fund arrangements. As I said at the beginning, the opponents of choice would no doubt want the issue to die, but it will not if the consumer movement has its way.</para><para>Could I advise the Senate that earlier this month the Consumer Policy Research Centre released its `Keys to Superannuation Choice' discussion paper. What did it say about fund choice and whether superannuation should continue to be paternalistically dispensed or whether there should be mandatory investment choice prior to moving down a fund choice route, and what proactive mechanisms would be needed if the choice route were followed? Time does not permit me to go into the report in detail, but I will advise that this group of consumers sends a clear and unequivocal message, and that is this: the centre supports the concept of superannuation fund choice. It has said at page 50 of its document:</para><para>The Centre believes that the development of a legislative regime for superannuation choice must proceed in a staged manner subject to the resolution of the major issues affecting its introduction such as education, disclosure, consumer protection, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and life insurance. However, the Centre also believes that these tasks must be undertaken quickly, as superannuation choice is already beginning to take place in the market.</para><para>Interestingly, the centre has been reported as saying that the argument about investment choice and fund choice is irrelevant. It says that we should have both, and soon. We on 
 the government side of the chamber look forward to working with consumers and others in achieving an optimal choice outcome. We hope that senators sitting on the non-government benches will move soon to review their positions and not leave themselves open to a charge that they are ignoring the needs and wishes of consumers.</para><para>There have been a number of letters to the papers in recent times, letters which go to the heart of the choice of super funds, and in fact there was one letter which I would like to table, if the Manager of Opposition Business will allow me, after I have shown it to himâif I could get his attention, which I cannot. This letter talks about the choice of super fund benefits to consumers and comments about a letter about superannuation choice which is misguided, and about a choice of fund regime that is linked to a consumer package, such as the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, having the potential to greatly enhance consumer rights. I would like to table the details of that letter.</para><para>I can only stress to the Senate that in fact the issue of choice of super fund is one that will be dealt with in, hopefully, the latter part of the year. It is of interest to consumers. As I said earlier in my speech, we have a situation where people are allowed to choose whether they go to a bank or a building society or any number of other organisations to get a house loan or to fund something else in that regard but where, when it comes to the choice of super funds, a vast number of people in Australia who are in superannuation funds have no choice and no right to choose any fund of their own for their investment. I hope that the Senate will see the sense of the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry and that the issue of superannuation fund choice is one that will be dealt with positively before the end of the year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Bartlett)</name></talker><para>âAre you seeking leave to table that document?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to table the document.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThere being no objection, and it being agree

One of the areas they chose to highlight was the so-called tensions within the party. Due to speculation in the media and a potential leadership petition, I wish to put on record my position. This leadership spill is not about whether I challenge or become leader, nor about my position as deputy. It is not about my behaviour or my perspective on the GSTâalthough, of course, I recognise that the leadership spill was interpreted by the national president, as is his right, to include my position as deputy.</para></talk.start><para>Nevertheless, in relation to speculation about a leadership challenge, I adhere to my recent statements. Two weeks ago, I said I would not challenge our leader, Senator Meg Lees, and I am sticking to that positionâeven allowing for extraordinary events, such as those that have occurred in the past week and, of course, for a degree of pressure and support. My reasons for not standing include the fact that I meant what I said two weeks agoâthose reasons remain the sameâand also because I do not wish current tensions within the party to be exacerbated further.</para><para>I also recognise that minimising tension is a two-way street. It means that the members have to respect the rights and decisions of the members of parliament, the senators; but, on the other hand, we also have to respect the will and the decisions of our members. That is a fundamental philosophy and value to which the Democrats adhere. I also recognise that we cannot afford as legislators, as members of our party room, to dismiss the concerns or the dissent among our membersâor, indeed, to dismiss any suggestion that there is discomfort among the membership. My decision to not stand for the leadership is not about my not being ready or about a lack of support. It is because it is inappropriate, and I think it may lead to further party unrest.</para><para>What is true is that I differ from my party in relation to its decision on the GST package. Today, indeed, I exercised my right as a Democrat senator, a right that is part of our constitution, to exercise my vote according to conscience, as you did, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett. I will continue to work hard as Deputy Leader of this party, with a solid commitment to its principlesâprinciples of accountability, democracy, social justice and ecological sustainability. I will also encourage our members to work for the good of the party, to work together in order to bring about the progressive policies that we stand for. I do not dismiss the concerns that have been aired, the frustrations to which attention has been drawn.</para><para>I echo the sentiments tonight of my colleague Senator Bartlett in relation to his plea to the membership. I know that some of our membersâperhaps many of our membersâwill be disappointed by today's vote on the GST, but the answer is not to leave the party or to spill the leadership positions; it is to work hard, to commit ourselves to the party, the processes and the policy work, and to influence the party by remaining involved, by participating in the process. As Senator Bartlett has said on record tonight, the decision today does not have to represent an ideological shift in our party. All senators, all the party room, remain committed to and united in our pursuit of social justice, ecological sustainability and democracy.</para><para>Of course, there has always been debate and discussion in our party about the role of the party and the parliamentary wings of the Australian Democrats. Tonight's <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program did highlight the fact that some of our members are frustrated on this occasion by the actions of the parliamentary wing and they have chosen to exercise their right to complain through one of the mechanisms available to them, which is a ballot on the tax agreement. My message tonight is for our members: you determine our policy and you ensure that the party room is guided by the party's principles. I believe we are a true grassroots party, a participatory and democratic party. These are values we all cherish. We will listen to our members and act on their 
 concerns, but they must stay involved. This is what makes the Australian Democrats different</para><para>I have watched tonightâindeed, over the last couple of weeksâwith amazement as the media have grappled with this notion of direct participation and with the notion of a conscience vote. Clearly, many observers have a lot to learn about how the Democrats work, what sets us apart from the old parties. Hopefully, the media, other commentators and the legislators will learn quickly about the ways of our party, a party that has always prized conscience and direct participation in processes and policy.</para><para>As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it is not easy to vote differently from your colleagues. So I thank the many branches, members and divisions that have sent messages or motions of support. I also acknowledge the positive comments for the work that my leader, Senator Meg Lees, has done in negotiating improvements to the package. I hope that this process is not going to destabilise our party, but that we will emerge from this healthy debate stronger and as always the real alternative to the old parties in this place.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenwich University</title><page.no>6712</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6712</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat sounded more like a policy speech to me than anything else. It is interesting just to reflect that the party that tries to say that the other parties are old parties is in fact now 22 years old. So it has been around for a couple of decades. I think the term `old parties' is now being used because the Democrats cannot bring themselves to say `major parties'âlike the major parties that have major support.</para></talk.start><para>The purpose of my rising tonight was to invite Senator Carr to consider the way that Senator Gibbs conducted herself tonight in the adjournment debate. I have to say to you that Senator Gibbs's speech was very good. I think it did credit to her and to the Senate. That is in stark contradistinction to Senator Carr's contribution, which is a continuation of 
 his unprincipled and unsustained attack on Greenwich University.</para><para>Over the months now, we have had to listen in this place to these unprincipled and unsustained attacks. Senator Tierney, to his great credit, has done a welter of research on this and has completely exposed Senator Carr's lack of intellectual integrity and indeed the bankruptness of his arguments in relation to the allegations he has been making against Greenwich University. Indeed, one of the things that Senator Carr has been accusing Greenwich University of in recent times is that they had people of no real academic repute. I think that has been absolutely and utterly laid to rest. A Privileges Committeeâdominated, as I understand it, by the Labor Party and chaired by Labor senator Robert Rayâhas agreed that certain statements, for want of a better term, of self-defence by people from Greenwich University ought to be incorporated into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.

It has been one of those tactics that we have become used to with Senator Carr. When there is a deficit in his reasoning, he becomes a lot more voluminous to try to make a point. He becomes a lot more repetitious in the hope that that deficit of reasoning will somehow be overcome by volume and repetition. The senator ought to take the tip that it will not work. Senator Tierney, through very reasoned debate and considered contributions to this chamber, has now exposed Senator Carr's contribution as being intellectually lacking in rigourâand in fact some people would say `bankrupt'. Other words spring to mind which may well be unparliamentary, so I will not use them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the allegation of mickey mouse courses being available at Greenwich University, it seems very strange for a leading figure of the socialist left to make such allegations. I remember that about 20 years ago when I was at university, even at my home university, the intellectually bankrupt of the Left would run courses on campus that some of us would describe as mickey mouse courses. Senator Tierney has assisted us in reading out a list of courses that are, or were, available at Sydney University. Confucian politics in a rocky modern world may well take the cakeâor indeed comparative approaches to mysticism, or Senator Carr's favourite socialist law. I think there are only one or two regimes left in the world that would describe themselves as socialist and that would be Cuba and North Korea.

When the Labor Party was in government, it gave postgraduate grants of over $25,000 to two peopleâone to do a thesis on tourism in fascist Italy and another to do medieval witchcraft.

I suppose that is the great contradistinction between Senator O'Chee and Senator Carr, in as much as Senator O'Chee has been a man of principle. We on this side would argue that he was the victim of One Nation in his own state of Queensland. However, he took a very principled stance against One Nation, for which I happen to take my hat off to him. If Senator Carr was not so busy not thinking and had listened to the contribution by Senator Gibbs, he would feel, like so many other senators, that Senator O'Chee's departure from this place is a matter to be greatly regretted.</para><para>In this game of politics, from time to time very genuine individuals make allegations or assertions that, on further reflection or further analysis, cannot be sustained. Then the onus is on those senators to come into this place and correct the record. Unfortunately, what 
 we have seen from the Labor Party time and again are unsubstantiated allegations. When they have been exposed as being completely without foundation, like the allegations against the Baillieu family when certain people supposedly involved in this intrigue had been dead for 30 and 50 years and were unable to have performed this activityâunless, of course, you believe in the Labor Party's view of medieval witchcraftâthe Labor Party should have apologised, but they never did. The challenge to Senator Carr is to apologise. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>6714</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.51 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>6714</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>6714</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry ActâAustralian Meat and Live-stock Industry (High Quality Beef Export to the European Union) Amendment Order 1999 (No. 1).</para><para>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ActâAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority (Commonwealth Costs) Determination 1999.</para><para>Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions Supervisory Levy Imposition ActâAuthorised Deposit-taking Institutions Supervisory Levy Imposition Determination 1999.</para><para>Authorised Non-operating Holding Companies Supervisory Levy Imposition ActâAuthorised Non-operating Holding Companies Supervisory Levy Imposition Determination 1999.</para><para>Christmas Island ActâList of applied Western Australian Acts for the periodâ</para><para>21 March to 30 September 1998.</para><para>1 October 1998 to 19 March 1999.</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâInstrument Nos CASA 295/99 and CASA 297/99.</para><para>Cocos (Keeling) Islands ActâList of applied Western Australian Acts for the periodâ</para><para>21 March to 30 September 1998.</para><para>1 October 1998 to 19 March 1999.</para><para>Defence Actâ</para><para>Defence Force Remuneration TribunalâDeterminations Nos 6-8 of 1999.</para><para>Determinations under section 58BâDefence Determinations 1999/23 and 1999/24.</para><para>Export Control ActâExport Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 1999 (No. 2).
