According to the Yellow Pages small business index, 80 per cent of Australian small businesses want the Australian taxation system reformed. We would like to have 100 per cent, but I will settle for 80. They know all the benefits that are there. Of course, a lot of people have had a view on this subject over the years—the ramshackle nature of that taxation system. Who said this:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australian governments have known for years that the country's tax system was unfair, antiquated and almost unworkable.</para><para>Do you know who said it?

It is very interesting that in their heart of hearts and even in public people like Gareth Evans and now Senator Cook have come out endorsing the tax reform proposals.

But what has happened now? This is a very instructive tale because it shows what happens when people get out into the real world, when they are not actually bound hand and foot by their union masters. Peter Duncan started up a little company called Dine-out Victoria Square Pty Ltd, and he had the temerity to actually employ non-union labour—a criminal offence, as we all know. So they dragged him off to the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>It is not only sad that Peter Duncan is singled out for that sort of treatment, but also what happens is that small businesses get a letter from the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union saying this sort of thing, `On behalf of the union, I enclose a log of claims and demand that within seven days you will observe the wages and conditions of employment set out in the log or we will take you to court.'</para><para>Do you know what the log of claims says? It demands weekly wages of between $1,000 and $2,500 a week, a $200 superannuation contribution a week, a 30-hour working week

The Community Development Employment Program was introduced by the Fraser government. It is one of the highlights of what has occurred in Aboriginal affairs over a long period of time. It was introduced to address the problem that occurs particularly in remote communities, where employment is a major problem. As Senator McKiernan has pointed out, there are particular problems in remote communities, where there are no other 
 means of employment available, and the Community Development Employment Program allows the community to determine what action should be taken for the community itself rather than for the individuals. In the majority of cases it is part time.</para></talk.start><para>There have been claims recently that there have been deliberate attempts at reducing the number of CDEP places, and I am aware of the claims that Senator McKiernan referred to. I would refer senators to the Spicer report into the CDEP, which recommended a number of changes. They were accepted by both the government and ATSIC. Ian Spicer was formerly the executive officer for the—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—ACCI.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>—ACCI. Thank you, Senator Cook. In any case, Mr Spicer suggested that as many as one-third of CDEP recipients are not working but instead receiving what they call sit-down money. His view, which the government accepts, is that these people should be progressively shifted from CDEP to more appropriate social security programs. This means, if Mr Spicer's estimates are correct, that some 10,000 CDEP places will be freed up for use in new CDEPs or to expand existing ones. This issue needs to be addressed before additional CDEP places are funded. That was accepted by ATSIC as well, as Senator McKiernan may be interested to know.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In regard to other recommendations by Mr Spicer, the government and ATSIC are enthusiastically pursuing them but they are being threatened by the Labor Party. In line with Mr Spicer's report, the government has sought to remove anomalies from the CDEP scheme. For example, CDEP recipients do not receive rental assistance, nor do they receive health cards or the $10 special allowance paid to mainstream Work for the Dole recipients. We have introduced legislation in the other place to correct these anomalies, to the benefit of the vast majority of CDEP recipients. So the vast majority of CDEP recipients will in fact have their position improved by these amendments. Labor, however—Senator McKiernan is reflecting this—was caught in its blind desire to oppose everything the government does and so voted against these changes. I 
 would strongly urge senators opposite to reconsider their totally indefensible position when the legislation is debated in this place.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3468</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask a supplementary question, Madam President.

In specific terms, increases in social security payments and income tax cuts are part of a raft of important compensation measures. These measures will ensure that indigenous people on low incomes, income support and CDEP—as Senator McKiernan mentioned—are not only compensated for the impact of the GST but also share in the gains of the new system.</para><para>It also has to be remembered that the indigenous median age is about half that of the wider community. Senator Cook may be interested to know that, as a result, indigenous families are larger and younger. So they will also receive substantial benefits from increased family allowance payments. We have allowed sufficient margin for people not to be disadvantaged in remote areas, where costs can be higher. Social security payments will be increased by four per cent to cover an estimated cost of living increase of around 1.9 per cent. Income support benefits will be kept 1.5 per cent higher than they would have been had the normal indexation arrangements been applied. While some food items might increase, many in fact will be cheaper because we will abolish Labor's hidden tax—the wholesale sales tax—which taxed people at up to 30 per cent. That included people in rural and remote areas.</para><para>A reduction of diesel fuel excise will significantly cut transport costs for heavy

It is difficult to reconcile recent claims with the history of research in the area, the facts relating to legally binding permissions given for works on the lease, and the actions of traditional owners over the last 20 years. From 1975 on, the site of Boyweg has been known, photographed, mapped and protected. Several reputable anthropologists, working 
 closely with traditional owners, including the father of the current senior traditional owner, have defined the site of Boyweg as a `small discrete soakage or spring on the edge of the wetlands located to the west of the Jabiluka mine valley'. It was regarded as a sacred but not a dangerous site.</para></talk.start><para>This site is linked by a dreaming trail to another separate site known as Almudj, also protected and registered. The area between these sites is claimed now by some to be a sacred site. The location and definition of the site was discussed and confirmed in the 1977 Fox inquiry, the claim book for the 1982 Alligator Rivers stage 2 land claim, and the research necessary for registration on the National Estate for sites on the lease, including Boyweg and Almudj. Furthermore, between 1971 and 1978, before the area became Aboriginal land, Pancontinental drilled some 250 holes in the mine valley in the area between the two sites.</para><para>In 1980, Justice Toohey heard evidence in the Alligator Rivers stage 2 land claim. Evidence was provided by the current traditional owner's father who described Boyweg as: `Just up here where the buffalo wallow is now. It used to be a sacred site before.' In 1981, Justice Toohey reported his findings on the land claim. While his report gives considerable attention to the proposed Jabiluka project—as it was, of course, then planned—no concerns over Boyweg or Almudj were noted. Although the proposal was much larger than the present initiative, the site does not appear to have been under any threat.</para><para>In the years leading up to 1982, the Northern Land Council carried out extensive consultation with traditional owners and affected Aboriginal communities over the Jabiluka project. In 1982, an agreement was signed which stated:</para><para>It was agreed by the NLC on behalf of traditional Aboriginal owners that there are no sacred sites within the fenced area. Traditional Aboriginal owners have instructed the NLC that they have no present intention of conferring upon any place the status of a sacred site within the fenced area during the term of the deed.</para><para>That is, in 1982 the traditional owners were saying that there was no sacred site. The current area now claimed to be Boyweg 
 includes part of that fenced area to which I just referred. It was not until 1997, some 15 years later, that claims started to be made about an extended area for Boyweg, possibly covering the whole of the mine valley. These revisions also upgraded the category of the site from sacred to sacred and dangerous.</para><para>In 1997, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority, including 10 out of 12 Aboriginal site custodians, declined to register the site citing disagreement among traditional owners over its location and significance. It was not until 1999 that traditional owners informed me that they now believe that this site was wider, covering the whole mine valley, and more significant, et cetera.

The trouble with the new expanded claims is that they are not consistent with the known facts.

The school will operate in two parts, with each part accompanying a show troupe as it moves across the eastern part of Australia. Two circuits will make that journey on the eastern seaboard.

 that the rest of the community takes for granted. It is no secret that the children of these people are disadvantaged in an educational sense. The choice they have is either to stay at home and not see their parents or to join them on the road. We now have an answer to that. Although there are some 80 children involved, it is still a very important move because we are now setting an example not only for other areas where mobile schools might be used but also on the international scene where there has been some international interest in this.

It was very clear from the minister's answer today that 
 the government has done no modelling and conducted no impact studies on the effect of the GST on the lives of people with disabilities and the organisations that support them.</para><para>It was very clear from answers to questions during the committee inquiry process that the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Department of Family and Community Services have done no work to try to influence Treasury's modelling and Treasury's compensation packages for people with disabilities. This means that the government has no idea of the impact of its GST tax package on people with disabilities. We think this is deplorable. We think the government stands condemned for failing to do the work, for failing to take enough interest to work out what the impact will be and to work out whether or not the compensation packages offered in conjunction with the tax package will be sufficient to assist those people through the changed taxation regime.</para><para>It is just not good enough for the government to say they do not know. They have an obligation to care, they have an obligation to do the work to ensure that the tax package is fair for those persons. What is clear today from the press release from the Joint Church and Community Services Alliance Group is that they reject the government's often asserted claim that the tax package is fair. It clearly is not fair, and one of the key groups disadvantaged by the tax package is people with disabilities, but of course that also includes pensioners and a whole range of other people on fixed incomes who will be severely disadvantaged by the totality of the tax package.</para><para>It is clear that the government have taken the attitude that we will throw everyone into a pot, work out the average and the average will do for all: the average compensation package, the average outcome in terms of housing, the average outcome in terms of cost of living. People are not averages. People do not eat averages. People's lives are different, their experiences are different and their needs are different. One of the key groups that is very different in terms of their needs is people with disabilities, because they have very different needs from others in the community.</para><para>One of the things that is clear about people with disabilities is that they have a very different consumption pattern. They are large consumers of services and they need extra services. They need assistance with personal services—and most of those look like they will be GST free. But there is a range of other services which they consume in greater quantities than other people do—things like transportation, home help services, handyman services, home maintenance. All those things that we are able to do ourselves, very often people with disabilities have to employ someone to do. They use services that are largely discretionary for other people.</para><para>In introducing a goods and services tax, the government are introducing a tax on services, in most cases, for the first time. People who use a lot of services have a disproportionate impact placed upon them by the imposition of this tax. The services part of the new taxation regime will seriously impact on the quality of life of people with disabilities. In general, these people are doing it tough already—surviving on low incomes and having to overcome huge barriers to their full participation in the community. And we are adding another 10 per cent barrier to their participation in the community, their enjoyment of life and their ability to participate in the things that other people take for granted.</para><para>The services that people with disabilities use are widespread and costly, and they spend a disproportionate amount of their income already on services. By taxing services, we increase the cost of that consumption and we increase their inability to fully participate in the community, because the costs of the services they need are increased.</para><para>The government have done nothing to appreciate that. They have done nothing to examine the impacts of the GST on the lives of people with disabilities. All the groups have been before the GST Community Affairs Committee making this very case. They have provided the detailed information on consumption patterns, and the government say, `You will all be better off because, on average, it will all be okay.' But, with every average, there has to be someone above the average and someone below the average. And 
 the people below the average are the people with disabilities—the people who will have to consume large amounts of services. They are going to be taxed a disproportionate amount, and there will be a much more adverse effect on their lifestyles as a result of the government's taxation package.</para><para>The government must do some modelling. The government must address the issues of people with disabilities and ensure that they have a much better result from this tax package than they currently look like getting if the government is successful in having this legislation passed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>3480</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Again we are hearing the opposition trying to justify why they will not support the taxation reform—something they realised has been needed since 1985.

 modelling except in Treasury. Senator Newman's department has done no modelling. The health department has done no modelling, and it could answer no questions when we asked it in our committee, `What will be the impact?' But many of the witnesses who came before our committee knew the impact.</para></talk.start><para>Many of those are back today as an alliance of the Australian Council of Social Service, the Uniting Church, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Anglicare, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, St Vincent de Paul and some elements of the Salvation Army. No way are these paid up stoolies for the Labor Party, and no way are they are a bunch of ratbags. They brought excellent evidence before our committee, and they have brought it back again today. They say what is clear to anybody who is serious about looking at this bill—that this tax package is very unfair, and it will entrench inequality in Australia well into the future if it should pass. It will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots. It is based on a trickle-up effect, where the poor pay the tax and the rich take it home. It is quite outrageous.</para><para>The government over there pretend that they know it is about something else. Those people whose names I have listed have all done the serious work. They got groups of reliable, responsible accountants like Ernst and Young and Arthur Andersen to do the work for them—to make sure that they have not got it wrong—and they are clear: low income families in Australia will have grossly inadequate compensation.</para><para>It is very interesting that, at the very time that legislation was introduced that will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots, the Prime Minister went before large sections of corporate Australia last weekend to say, `I've got $50 million of precious taxpayer money, and I'm going to set that aside as tax deductions for corporate Australia to encourage them to become philanthropists.' For the first time ever, he is taxing the charitable institutions in this country—if he has $50 million to 
 spare, why doesn't he give it to the charities that do the work on the ground, instead of giving tax cuts to corporate Australia in case they are generous?</para><para>It is a very big irony that the Prime Minister should be encouraging philanthropy with massive tax cuts when at the same time he is introducing for the first time ever taxes on the charitable and not-for-profit sector in this country. It is completely against the fabric of Australian society to tax charitable and not-for-profit institutions. How about this: for the first time ever, a tax on the Girl Guides and a tax on the Boy Scouts. We have seen how the government says, `Well, we didn't mean it on bob-a-job.' What about bob-a-job week? What about the Girl Guide biscuits? What about the surf lifesavers and St Vincent de Paul? What about the GST on the lamington cake stall?

It is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It takes no regard of the sort of Australia that we have become—a society where people want to put in their pennyworth and contribute through voluntary activity and through charitable and not-for-profit institutions. Now that is under attack.</para></talk.start></continue><para>More importantly than anything, it is an unfair, ungenerous bill that is going to make the poor and the low income families poorer and worse off than ever before. Under law, that poverty and that lack of income will be there forever. We all know that any compensation, small as it is, will not last. In every other country the GST has risen. It will rise in this country because there is no extra revenue out of these bills. It is just a different way of making the money go round.

She said, for example, that the minister did not understand what the government's tax package was about. It is absolute nonsense to think that the Minister for Family and Community Services would not understand how the tax package impacts on the 1.5 million Australians who have some disability and need personal care and assistance. Of course the minister understands that. Senator Crowley's assertion that the government did no modelling to work out what the impact on people with disabilities would be is absolute nonsense, as was her first assertion that the minister did not understand what the package had for people with disabilities and what compensation it provided.</para></talk.start><para>In formulating its draft goods and services tax legislation, the government accepted the recommendations of the Vos committee report and made the vast bulk of disability services available GST free to people who need them. Additionally, because we are a caring and sensitive government that makes sure that people with disabilities are not in any way unfairly dealt with, the government has made available a comprehensive list of medical aids and appliances used by people with disabilities which are to be GST free. So, in following the recommendations of the Vos report, the government has made sure that the services available to people with disabilities and the mechanical and other aids they need are GST free.</para><para>It is true that the commercial activities of charities and business services run by organisations involved with disabled people will attract a GST.

Those taxes pervade the whole work environment. So the answer to 
 `What about the services?' is that the services will be cheaper and that people with disabilities who are on disability service pensions will be compensated by the four per cent increase in pensions and by the other compensation means available through the tax package. An essential theme of this tax package is that people with disabilities should not be disadvantaged at all. For that reason, the government has gone out of its way to make sure that, as I have said, the services and mechanical aids required by people with disabilities are GST free.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Crowley mentioned a long list of people and organisations who made submissions to the committee. I attended hearings of this committee, along with Senator Crowley and a number of other members of the Senate, and I must say that my impression was that many of the people who made submissions displayed a great lack of knowledge and understanding of the tax package. This was in spite of the fact that the government distributed a comprehensive community sector briefing kit which covered most of the issues raised. All this goes to show that, like the opposition and like many other organisations who appeared before the various GST committees, the bill had not been read, that the proposals had not been understood and that most of the evidence given and the complaints made were in ignorance of how the proposed tax package will work and, in particular in terms of disabled people, in ignorance of the fact that the government has gone out of its way to ensure that the disabled of Australia are not disadvantaged and are adequately compensated by this package.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3483</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have never heard such waffle in all my life.

Their cost of living is much higher due to the specialised living expenses they have, including housing, transport, medical, pharmaceuticals, disability equipment, personal care and miscellaneous costs. Transportation in particular is vital to people with disabilities. We were given evidence that taxis are commonly used because people with a disability are often unable to access public transport or drive a car and so have no other option. A normal person can get into their car or can catch a bus, train or plane. Whatever they want to do, they have that choice. But these people do not have an option.</para><para>They do not have an option with the services they have to have in their homes. If people choose to live independently, they have maintenance costs—the lawnmower man has to come, they need house maintenance and cleaning and gardening services and the 
 car has to be washed. These people must even employ someone to fit a light bulb—something which is nothing to us. This is a service and the GST applies to services. They do not have a choice; their expenses are enormous. They have special needs in areas that we take for granted.</para><para>Let me quote something:</para><para>The Physical Disability Council of NSW submitted an analysis of the effect of the GST on people with a disability.

But we have had four months of a travelling roadshow—the inquiry into the GST—which has turned out an absolute mishmash of criticisms without very much foundation at all. That is the problem—look at today's report of the litany of organisations that joined in the criticism that ACOSS made of the GST. As Senator Newman said, ACOSS's criticisms do not seem to 
 have changed much since the very beginning. You have to understand that ACOSS was never, ever going to support the model because it shifts tax from a direct to an indirect base and that is just something that ACOSS will not support.</para></talk.start><para>By the same token, and this must be said, ACOSS supports tax reform because it realises—I would suggest it is an absolutely self-evident proposition—that unless there is fundamental tax reform there is a serious problem for the social security base—it is put totally at risk. It is self-evident that ACOSS does support tax reform; it might not like the model, but it was never going to like it. If you accept these fundamental assumptions then you can put the criticisms in context.</para><para>It is very easy to criticise the GST package and to not really expose your own conclusions. Although I have not been on the GST committees, I suspect that that is very much what has happened over these past four months. There has been a barrage of criticism with very little foundation and very little to support conclusions.</para><para>I find quite offensive the suggestion made this afternoon that the government is unsympathetic to people who are adversely impacted by the GST, by any reform package or by any policy position. The fact that there is a generous compensation package clearly underscores the fact that the government is concerned about people on low incomes, people with disabilities and certainly the elderly. Proof of that is not only in the compensation package but also in the fact that, in the formulation of the draft GST legislation, the government has accepted recommendations of the Vos committee's report and made the vast bulk of disability services available GST free to people who need them. That does not seem to me to be a government that is not concerned about how a package will impact on people with disabilities.</para><para>A comprehensive number of medical aids and appliances used by people with disabilities will also be GST free. As Senator Newman pointed out, commercial activities and business services of charities will be liable for a GST because they are just that—they are commercial activities—but they will be able 
 to claim back, as indeed any other business can, any GST paid on inputs for these activities as an input tax credit. No convincing case has been made as to why there should be any different treatment for commercial activities.</para><para>The government's tax reforms are expected to reduce the cost of community services by about 2.7 per cent due to the abolition of 10 existing and inefficient taxes which pervade the whole system and which, I strongly suggest, impact much more strongly and much more unfairly on people with disabilities. They are hidden taxes that everyone in the community has to deal with.</para><para>Pensions for people with disabilities will rise by four per cent to assist with the impact of tax reforms. There has not yet been one convincing bit of modelling or evidence before any GST committee, so far as I know, that proves that that is inadequate. If somebody can come forward with convincing evidence, then you would be talking to a government that would be prepared to listen, but so far no-one has come forward. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Chris Schacht, also accompanied the mission party representing the federal opposition.</para><para>Members may have seen television or press coverage of the events undertaken during the mission tour.</para><para>The mission was formally farewelled by the Prime Minister at the historic Victoria Barracks in Sydney. The first stop for the mission group was Singapore where ceremonies were held at Kranji War Cemetery and Changi Chapel. These ceremonies commemorated all those who died or were captured at the fall of Singapore and were imprisoned and died at Changi and buried at Kranji.</para><para>The mission party then moved to Sandakan for the two major ceremonies of the mission program. 
</para><para>These were the opening at the Sandakan Memorial Park of a commemorative pavilion and the dedication of a memorial stone, in memory of those who suffered and died as prisoners of war of the Japanese at Sandakan, on the death marches and at Ranau during World War II.</para><para>There was no worse worst wartime atrocity to affect Australian servicemen than the Sandakan-Ranau death marches, yet relatively few Australians know of the events.</para><para>In 1942, more than 2,700 prisoners of war were moved from Singapore to Sandakan to construct an airfield for the Japanese. During the latter part of 1943, following the breaking of an underground intelligence ring in the camp, almost all of the prisoner of war officers were moved to Kuching.</para><para>As the tide of war turned, and fearing an allied invasion, the Japanese marched most of the Sandakan POWs to Ranau, 250 kilometres to the west. By September 1945, all but six of the POWs were dead—and these survived only because they had escaped. As well, the Japanese destroyed the POW camp at Sandakan in an effort to hide evidence of their brutality.</para><para>Among the Sandakan mission party was Mr Owen Campbell, now the only one of those six escapees still alive.</para><para>The commemorative pavilion contains a number of panels which set out in full detail the background and history of the camp. At one end of the building is a stained glass window, which helps provide an appropriate setting for contemplation.</para><para>The Sandakan Memorial, an imposing monolith measuring some three metres tall, also offers visitors a place where floral tributes or other tokens of remembrance may be laid.</para><para>The structures are part of a $750,000 upgrade to the Sandakan Memorial Park, which follows a 1995 memorandum of understanding between the Australian government, the Sandakan Municipal Council, the Returned and Services League of Australia and the Sabah State Forestry Department.</para><para>Following an emotional ceremony at the Sandakan Memorial Park, which included many local dignitaries and local veterans, the mission group travelled to Ranau, closely following the death march route.</para><para>At Ranau a commemorative ceremony was held at the Gunner Cleary Memorial on the site of the old POW camp. The story of Gunner Cleary is a particularly poignant one and it has come to symbolise the fate of all those who suffered and died at Sandakan and on the death marches.</para><para>Gunner Cleary was recaptured after trying to escape. He was chained by the neck at a stake, brutally beaten, spat upon and starved for almost eleven days. When he was at the point of death he 
 was given to his mates who cleaned his wounds and comforted him before he died in their arms.</para><para>The final destination of the mission group was the Labuan War Cemetery. Here in the tranquil surrounds of the carefully tended Commonwealth War Graves cemetery, lie the remains of all those who died at Sandakan, on the death marches and at Ranau.</para><para>Along the walls at the entrance to the cemetery are the names of those with no known grave. The ceremony at Labuan was a fitting commemoration to all those who had suffered and died during that tragic period. Attended by local dignitaries, local citizens and expatriate Australians living in Malaysia, the final ceremony was a fitting tribute to those who suffered and died.</para><para>What are the benefits of missions such as this?</para><para>The main objective is to raise awareness within the community through the publicity that surrounds such a visit. Far too many Australians are unaware of events at Sandakan and I trust that through this visit many will have come to know about this enormous tragedy.</para><para>The impact on those who took part in the mission was quite overwhelming. No-one on the mission could fail to be moved by the emotion surrounding the commemorative ceremonies.</para><para>For some there was a healing of the heart that for far too long had carried the hurt and pain of the loss of a husband, brother or father. For others, there was, as described by one, `a sense of peace from having, at last, stood by his grave to say goodbye'.</para><para>It is regrettable of course, that not every person who suffered loss at Sandakan could take part in this particular mission.

The select committee's first report was not published until 19 February, we have had visits to all of the capital cities except Darwin, and we have had to write a report in that very tight time frame. So I thank the secretariat very much for their achievement in this area.</para><para>The committee considers that this government's tax package is unfair, complex, confusing and significantly flawed in many areas. Evidence presented to the committee over two months confirms that this tax package will entrench inequality. It will divide the community and ensure and entrench that division in the community, if it should pass, for years to come. It will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots. High income earners will get generous tax cuts and low income households will have paltry compensation. It 
 is, if you like, a trickle-up effect: the poor shall pay the tax cuts for the rich.</para><para>It has often been said that this is just the Labor Party being negative and mean. This report is not the Labor Party's view; it is the Labor Party and Democrat conclusion as a majority report on the evidence given to the committee. That evidence was given by any number of witnesses, some of whom had gone to the bother of finding organisations—firms like Ernst and Young or Arthur Andersen—to examine the legislation and its impact on their organisations and the people they represent. So in no way are these a bunch of paid stoolies coming to run a Labor line; these are people who for the first time have had the opportunity to look in detail at the impact of the GST legislation. They have found it wanting—particularly wanting in its compensation for low income and middle income households.</para><para>The package's compensation is very unfair and very unjust. More than that, any number of people of significance have reminded us that that compensation will be eroded over a very short time. The last to do so was Professor Geoff Carmody, certainly not a renowned spokesperson for the Labor Party. His evidence needs to be taken very seriously. The compensation is insufficient. It takes no account of the expenditure patterns of low income households—that they spend at least 25 to 30 per cent of their income on food, which for the first time will have a 10 per cent GST, and that they spend about another 25 to 30 per cent of their income on the cost of rent and housing. The government itself admits that that will rise by 2.3 per cent, and the evidence given to us is that it will rise by far more. We need to remember that people on pensions and fixed incomes, but particularly pensions, usually have a requirement that they pay 25 per cent of their income for rent. The minute they get another four per cent, one per cent of that automatically goes through to rent. So they have much less as disposable income to spend on their requirements.</para><para>The other point that I find very disappointing is that, at the very same time as Prime Minister Howard is meeting with corporate 
 Australia urging them to practise philanthropy and telling them that he will find $50 million to assist them if they should choose to do that, his government has introduced for the first time ever a tax on the charities and not-for-profit sector in this country. This is the first time we have seen a tax on the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, the surf lifesavers and St Vincent de Paul. They know that, as a result of this tax, to maintain their services they will have to make significant cuts. But what they also realise is that to maintain their organisations' viability they will have to cut services at precisely the time that low income people affected by the GST will have an even larger need for the services they provide.</para><para>Lest people say, as some people have said in this place and in evidence to our committee, `Oh well, these people do not know what they are talking about,' the Boy Scouts, for example, were acting on written advice from Treasury. We know of other examples. The funeral directors were told on written advice that they should introduce the 10 per cent GST on prepackaged funerals right now. So it is not that this committee made it up. It is not that people are running amok out there. It is the first time that the community, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee have had the opportunity to look at this legislation in detail, and they have found it very significantly wanting.</para><para>At its core, what lots of witnesses say is that it is unAustralian. It will enshrine that divide of the poor and the rich. It will legislate to ensure that we have that division forever, and that has never been the case in the past and it is very unAustralian. For the first time we have seen a tax on charities. That is also very unAustralian. It is important that we recognise the contribution of the not-for-profit and voluntary sector and the charities to the fabric of Australian society. For the first time, that is now significantly under threat and significantly changed.</para><para>The compensation that people worry about needs to be considered like this. If you earn $75,000, you will get about $86 a week in tax cuts. If you are a single pensioner, you will get $2.89. If you are a pensioner couple, you 
 will get $4.81—as one witness said to us, just enough for the price of a package of cereal.</para><para>Finally I would just like to make a few comments about the way our inquiry was conducted. In her report and in her other contributions Senator Knowles argues that the government has a mandate for this legislation, but she spends significant pages of her minority report explaining that many of the witnesses did not understand it. How can you claim a mandate when you can point out that the witnesses do not understand the legislation? If you have a mandate, people have voted for what they know about. Indeed, what is clear is that when people do know about it they vote against it in significant numbers.</para><para>The other thing is that the inquiry, as I have said, has done the work for government. For the first time ever, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee in health, welfare, child care, aged care and local government have finally realised the detail that is now available to them that was never available during the election. Senator Knowles attacked people for what they did not know. She refused to admit that the departments of relevance had done no modelling, that the community had no evidence. And I take this opportunity to apologise to all those witnesses who were directly offended by Senator Knowles's very unsenatorial attacks on them on many occasions. This is a critically important report. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>3493</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is interesting, in speaking to this Community Affairs References Committee report today, that Senator Crowley concluded by doing what she did throughout the entire hearing—that is, sledging. It has been a great shame because, while this committee inquiry was taking place—and Senator Crowley now leaves the chamber because she does not want to hear this contribution—she continually sledged anything that was put to the witnesses in terms of explanation.</para></talk.start><para>It needs to be put clearly, once and for all, that this process was flawed right from the start. The Labor Party and the minor parties decided to send legislation to the references committee instead of sending it to the legislation committee. Legislation should rightly go 
 to the legislation committee. But no; they wanted to control it—and that they did. That is why, whenever I tried to explain to witnesses where their assertions were wrong, I was told I was then badgering the witnesses.</para><para>One witness said, `I'm not here to hear what you've got to say; I'm here to tell you what I think.' I suppose, to a degree, that is true, but it was sad that they did not want to know the reality, because there was a lack of understanding about the embedded taxes that are being paid right throughout the system, from Labor's reign in office.</para><para>The claim that there was lack of consultation is pretty remarkable, given the fact that there have been thousands of consultations, both prior to the election and following it, through the tax task force chaired by Senator Gibson, of which I was a member, through the Vos committee and through subsequent consultations with ministers and members of parliament generally.</para><para>Following those consultations, there has been this continuing misrepresentation of a lot of the information that is available. Most people had not read the bill. I asked a lot of people, considering that this inquiry was into the bill, `Have you read the bill?' Most people said, `No, I haven't.' There were some very decent, honest, well-intentioned people who simply had it wrong. They begged for GST-free status. The legislation clearly showed that they had already been given GST-free status, but they had not read the bill.</para><para>There was also a lack of understanding of how people would get the tax credits, and that they would get the money back. Some places, such as the child-care industry, for example, have the best of both worlds: they do not pay the GST and they do not charge it. They came along and said, `We're going to increase our fees.'</para><para>The non-commercial activities of charities will not be taxed. They are GST free. Once again, they do not pay the tax and they do not charge it. Local government said that they did not understand it. I have personally met with local government dozens of times, as have various committees and ministers. Local government stands to be about $70 million 
 better off, to say nothing of the diesel fuel rebates as well.</para><para>Witnesses talked about compliance costs as though they were not keeping any records whatsoever at the moment. For a goods and services tax, they know their outgoings and their incomings. All they have to do is work out one-eleventh of both—if they are paying a GST and charging a GST—and submit the difference at the end of the reporting period. It is not particularly complex. When I asked witnesses, `Are you keeping records at the moment?', they said, `Yes.' I asked, `What is difficult about calculating one-eleventh of it?' Their eyes glazed over as if to say, `Is it that simple?'</para><para>This whole process has been badly misrepresented. It needs to be noted that Senator Evans regularly let the cat out of the bag, saying, `I'm from the Labor Party; we're voting against it.' The obvious question then is: why on earth did we have the inquiry? Clearly, the opposition parties were never going to change their minds. They did not really want to know what was going on; they were just going to vote against it.</para><para>Some witnesses, some of whom I would have thought should have known better, claimed there would be a cascading effect of the tax throughout the system. Precisely the reverse will happen. Yet Senator Crowley, as chairman, kept egging them on, saying, `Yes, that's right.' She clearly had not read the bill, and to this moment she has not read the bill.</para><para>On some occasions—Senator Abetz did it once in Tasmania and I did it regularly—I referred to page 79 of the bill, regarding various health professionals who will be GST free. Senator Crowley raised her eyebrows as if to say, `Is that so?' I referred to the list of medical aids and appliances. She did not have a clue what was contained in that list.</para><para>There are many calculations that are simply wrong. Senator Crowley referred earlier to the wonderful work done by accountants on behalf of some of these organisations. In many cases, I have to say, Madam President, I think they wasted their money. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association has written to say that the figures presented in Arthur Andersen's report to the committee 
 were wrong and they have had to be revised down. There were more and more examples of evidence given by accounting firms on behalf of their clients—for which, presumably, they paid very good money—which was simply wrong. I cannot understand how that can happen.</para><para>Many witnesses and Labor consistently claimed that food and services would go up by 10 per cent. They will not and cannot understand that that will not be the case. Nothing will go up by 10 per cent. They refuse to understand that there will be compensation, that the worst case scenario presented to the committee was that price increases would be 3.9 per cent. This package offers four per cent compensation plus 1½ per cent consistently above the CPI. Senator Crowley argued at the time that during their term in government the CPI was adequate on its own. We are offering 1½ per cent above the CPI plus the four per cent. So many of those calculations were wrong. They would consistently forget about that.</para><para>I think it is very sad, and it is equally sad that my time has run out. I commend to the Senate the minority report, because it does set out the facts yet again.	I encourage people from these various community groups and organisations to read the minority report if they do not want to read the legislation. I do encourage them to read the legislation, but if they do not want to read the legislation, they should at least read this report. Their minds will be put at rest, because in fact they will be better off. They will not be paying the embedded taxes that they are currently paying and most of them will not be paying the taxes that have burdened them in the past. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3495</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all the people who put in submissions and appeared as witnesses before the inquiry. They provided a great deal of information which was very helpful to me and to the Democrats. I express my disappointment at the very inadequate information provided by government departments that appeared before the Community Affairs References Committee—the Department of Aged Care and the Department of Family and 
 Community Services. Clearly, they had done very little in the way of investigating the implications of the tax package on a whole range of people that came under their responsibility. I think that is a great shame.</para></talk.start><para>One of the main issues the Democrats want to emphasise is that of housing. I draw people's attention to the supplementary report. Housing has received very little notice to date, but it is a serious matter which will clearly impact on people—particularly those in the private rental sector and in the public and community housing sector—more heavily than has previously been realised. Some action must be taken on this significant area. The treatment of charities has also received some attention to date. This is an area which, on the whole, should not cost the government money. It is simply applying a tax system in a more logical way and not penalising non-profit organisations that provide a community service because, if they did not exist, it would cost the taxpayer a hell of a lot more. That is an area that obviously needs close attention.</para><para>The other key area under the responsibility of the committee is that of health. There are many anomalies, particularly in relation to what nowadays are called complementary medicines and complementary services. There are massive problems and clear inconsistencies concerning acupuncturists and also some other health practitioners like massage therapists and others in the complementary medicine field. Again, this is an area which, in totality, should save the government money if they addressed it, rather than cost them money.</para><para>Those areas, apart from the broader concerns that the Democrats have expressed time and again since the package was brought down, are ones that we believe need closer attention. We have outlined them in our supplementary comments on this report. We urge the government to take them more seriously than they appeared to do in the course of the inquiry. I know they are having discussions privately with groups, and that is certainly to be welcomed, but it would be better if there was some acknowledgment that perhaps the package as it was handed out prior to the election is not the Ten Command 
 ments written in stone and it can be significantly improved. Indeed, it must be significantly amended in many areas, including some that have been outlined in this report, if there is any prospect of the package being in any way fair, particularly for lower and middle income earners which, from the Democrats' perspective, are the group of people that must be assisted by any tax reform before we ensure that people on higher incomes are adequately looked after by any tax reform.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3496</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In July last year the Greens warned that there would be a comprehensive loss to low income earners, women in the work force, non-profit organisations and charities if a GST as mooted by the government were brought in.

We are well aware, for example, that $3 billion was going to be handed on a platter in tax rebates to wealthy corporations, including transport, mining and woodchipping corporations, at a time when poor people were going to face the brunt of this tax. Community organisations, charities and non-government organisations, such as sporting and environment organisations, were going to have to not only face the tax but also face the difficulties involved in collecting the tax. Whereas it may have been all right to use an honorary accountant in the past, they will now need professional, paid accountants to deal with the much more complex system coming down the line. </para><para>The problem was that the Democrats said, `We will make the GST fair.' Many people in the Australian community thought that, if the government were re-elected, the Democrats would be there as a backstop to ensure that the taxation system would not damage non-government organisations, charities and the interests of the poorer people in our community. Now we find that what the Greens warned is true. In the report released today we find the Democrats either calling for a massive overhaul of various parts of the GST package or implying that the GST package should be rejected.</para><para>A broad band of community organisations, from Anglicare Australia to the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition—a large range of people who work, give their life, their spare time and their money to helping people who are disadvantaged, who are in minority groups or who have special interests in our society—today have endorsed what the Greens were saying last year. Let me read from the community call that they have made today:</para><para>. . . the Government's Tax Package as it now stands is unfair and unacceptable. It needs substantial changes to make it fairer and do justice to people on low incomes.</para><para>The proposed GST, by unnecessarily raising the costs of necessities of life, would be very harmful to people on low and fixed incomes such as pensioners, unemployed people, and most young people and people with disabilities. It would also cause major problems for families with children on modest incomes. Women would be disproportionately affected by the large increase in taxes on consumption due to their different work patterns and family responsibilities.</para><para>These groups representing a diversity of Australians who work for the good of this nation went on to make these observations. First of all: `keeping food GST free is critical'. The government says it will not. The groups say:</para><para>. . . removing other essentials or providing adequate compensation for them, are crucial necessary steps to protect people on low and modest incomes and to improve fairness.</para><para>The government says it will not. The groups say that the government's tax reform proposals need to be redesigned to take account of these concerns and to transparently safeguard 
 the interests of all Australians. The government will not.</para><para>With the government standing firm, these groups say that the current legislation should be rejected. I say to the Democrats: where do you stand in this? The information is now in. Are you now going to make it public—too late, as I would have it? Are you going to vindicate the stand of the Greens and say that, unless the government makes comprehensive changes to the tax package as called for by these community groups, this tax package should be rejected because it is so unfair to the Australian community, because it advantages the rich and disadvantages the poor, because it advantages those who have, and that includes wherewithal and access to government, but it disadvantages those who do not have, and that includes those who are cut off from government and from the power that comes through political connections?</para><para>The Democrats fostered this legislation through the last election by saying that they could make it fair. It is now manifestly clear that the Democrats cannot make this legislation fair. The government is not going to go into comprehensive rearrangement of the package. The Democrat senator who has just spoken said that in housing this legislation needs some action. There are other areas which need close attention. What is the action? What is the attention?</para><para>I can tell the Democrats that they have to reject this legislation. We said that all the way down the line. They enabled it to get through the last election because they said, `We'll cushion it, we'll make it fair.' It is time now for the Democrats to agree that they can do nothing of the sort, that they have consorted with a GST package and have fostered it through the last election—a GST package which is going to be an invidious package for the interests of poorer Australians and, I think, for average Australians as well. It is going to help divide the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this nation. It is time for the Democrats to say, `We were wrong.

This report relates to the then Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs International Services, known as DIS.</para><para>The Committee's concerns about this audit report related to the lack of focus of DIS' operational framework.

The Committee has concerns about DIS' ability to achieve its intended aim against vigorous international competition, particularly with a staff of seven. The Committee has recommended a further review of DIS.</para><para>Madam President, I now wish to make some comment on <inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 38</inline> . This report relates to the sale of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth Airports. The sale of these airport leases represented the first stage of the planned privatisation of the

The reforms spelt out in these bills were initiated in response to the Report of the Financial System Inquiry, chaired by Stan Wallis. They represent a further step along the path of financial system regulatory enhancements.</para><para>Such regulation should not stand in the way of economic and technological progress; nor should it promote the interests of one group over another. Instead, financial system regulation should provide a sound, stable environment to encourage the creation of wealth, and to facilitate trade.</para><para>As we approach the end of this millennium, it is helpful to consider these changes in the wider perspective of both international financial system developments and changes to the Australian regulatory environment.</para><para>And there have been massive changes. Twenty years ago, if you wanted to access your money, you had to go to a branch between 10:00 am to 3:00 pm Monday to Friday. Back then, the Automatic Teller Machine was just a distant idea, credit cards were virtually unknown, and no one could spell `EFTPOS' let alone pronounce it.</para><para>As the Treasurer has stated, we now have the lowest interest rates since man last walked on the moon. At least today, you can borrow relatively easily—including over the phone and internet. Back when Jack Schmitt ascended to the <inline font-style="italic">Apollo 17</inline>  lunar module on 14 December 1972—the last man on the moon—interest rates were of a similar level. But 
 it was virtually impossible for the majority of people to borrow. Going cap in hand to your local branch manager—you were lucky to get a small proportion of a housing loan at the reasonable interest rate. The balance of a housing loan was made up from an assortment of sources at considerably higher rates of interest, often up to five percentage points more.</para><para>In 1981, the then Treasurer, now our Prime Minister, received a report on the performance of financial regulation completed by the Australian Financial Inquiry. This formed the basis of many of the regulatory changes of the 1980s, including the floating of the dollar.</para><para>In the years following that report, it became clear to many that further reform was not just desirable but it was essential.</para><para>Honourable Senators will be aware that the Government introduced into the Senate last year a package of legislation to complete the first stage of the Government's financial sector reform program.</para><para>That package of legislation instituted wide-ranging measures aimed at improving the efficiency, competitiveness and stability of Australia's financial system. Included among those measures were the creation of a single prudential regulator—the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the strengthening of Australia's payments system with the creation of a Payments System Board within the Reserve Bank, and a refocusing of disclosure and consumer protection through the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to provide for the transfer of regulatory responsibility from the States and Territories to the Commonwealth of building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. This bill will allow building societies and credit unions to better compete with banks and to operate outside their existing State / Territory boundaries.</para><para>As such, consumers will have a greater selection of financial service providers, and a greater selection of financial products. In other words, Australian consumers will have greater choice. Providing consumers with greater choice is a further example of this Government's commitment to consumer empowerment and its commitment to consumer sovereignty.</para><para>The bill will also provide a single regulatory framework for life insurance companies and friendly societies, while recognising the special features of friendly societies. The amendments also strengthen regulation for life insurance and increase the flexibility of its application.</para><para>All told, about 20 building societies, 237 credit unions and 85 friendly societies will be involved in the regulatory transfer. These organisations represent 1326 branches nationally, with $38 billion in assets and 12,420 employees. 
</para><para>To complement this package, State and Territory Governments will be signing with the Commonwealth a Financial Sector Regulation Transfer Agreement and enacting legislation within their jurisdictions to effect this regulatory transfer.</para><para>Then, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, there will be a single consistent regulatory regime for deposit-taking institutions, life and general insurance, and superannuation.</para><para>The bill also proposes to make sundry minor amendments to correct errors that have been detected in the relevant acts and to improve consistency.</para><para>Madam President, after the last election the Prime Minister created a new ministerial position—the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. The new responsibilities taken by my colleague Mr Hockey reflect the realisation that the financial services industry comprises more than just the banks; there are also building societies, credit unions, friendly societies, insurance companies, asset managers, custodians, trustees, financial advisers and superannuation funds—to name just a few. This realisation also reflects the Government's desire to see these institutions playing a larger role in the financial services industry by increasing competition and offering a broader range of products to consumers.</para><para>This is also one of the country's fastest-growing sectors—a sector employing hundreds of thousands of Australians, a sector that is strongly contributing to our record economic growth, and a sector which is innovative and integral to our continued efforts to secure Australia's place as a centre for global financial services.</para><para>I will now turn to the bill in more detail.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 (APRA Act)</inline></para><para>The bill will expand and clarify APRA's ability to take on functions as a result of an agreement with a State or Territory. This will enable APRA to be contracted to provide prudential regulation and advisory services on a fee for service basis subject to the agreement of the Minister. The Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed that State and Territory Governments would remain responsible for the prudential regulation of housing cooperatives and trustee companies but they will be able to enter into an agreement with APRA to provide prudential regulation or advice services for these entities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment of the Banking Act 1959 (Banking Act) and the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Reserve Bank Act)</inline></para><para>The bill proposes to apply the Criminal Code—which is scheduled to come into force by March 2000—to the Banking Act and the Reserve Bank 
 Act. There will be no change in the penalties associated with any of the offences.</para><para>To ensure consistency between banks and other deposit-taking institutions, the bill proposes to extend the banking holiday and unclaimed moneys provisions to all authorised deposit-taking institutions.</para><para>The bill also proposes to extend the scope of APRA's standards and directions powers and to facilitate the development of voluntary industry support arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment of the Corporations Law</inline></para><para>Madam President, to enable the transfer of regulatory responsibility of building societies, credit unions and friendly societies to the Commonwealth, a new Schedule will be added to the Corporations Law that will provide for the registration of financial institutions and friendly societies as companies and the regulation of those companies under the Corporations Law by ASIC.</para><para>Both Ministerial Council for Corporations (MINCO) and the Ministerial Council for Financial Institutions (MINFIN) have unanimously approved the proposed amendments to the Corporations Law in the bill. Unanimous agreement of MINCO and MINFIN Ministers is required under the Corporations Agreement, because the amendments will have the effect of extending coverage of the Corporations Law to various classes of financial institutions established under State and Territory statutes.</para><para>The objective of the new Schedule is to facilitate the registration of the entities as companies with as little disturbance to operations, and as little conversion costs, as possible.</para><para>In line with this objective, the bill is structured so that at the transfer date, the entities themselves need do little to give effect to the transfer. Entities will be deemed to be registered as a company type that most closely fits their current structure, unless they elect to be registered as a different category prior to transfer. The bill provides for a transitional period of 18 months following the transfer day. Entities will be given this period to make the necessary changes to their own rules to recognise their new status as a company.</para><para>The change to a company form is not expected to present significant difficulties for the institutions concerned, since much of the Corporations Law regulatory framework already applies to them through the respective governing Codes. However, there are some matters that will require exemptions and modifications to be made. Most of these are of a transitional nature, such as the publication of Australian Company Numbers on documents, but there are some matters that are likely to justify ongoing relief from ordinary Corporations Law provisions. There are facilities in the bill to make 
 regulations with respect to such matters. Furthermore, there are powers on the part of ASIC to make exemption and modification orders to facilitate the transition.</para><para>The existing conduct and disclosure obligations which apply to friendly society benefit fund products will, as far as possible, be maintained pending the current review of conduct and disclosure obligations applying to financial products under the Government's Corporate Law Economic Reform Program.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Amendment of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (the Life Act)</inline></para><para>The transfer of friendly societies to the Commonwealth regime will increase contestability in the market for life insurance products. Until recently, multiple prudential regimes applied to life insurance business offered by financial institutions in different jurisdictions. In late 1997 a unified State scheme was created for state based friendly societies under the guardianship of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC). As friendly societies are still in transition under those arrangements, it is appropriate to make their entry into the life insurance regime as seamless as possible in the first instance.</para><para>To achieve this, it is proposed that for a transition period, the detailed requirements in respect of friendly societies (particularly in regard to actuarial standards) will be reinstated on the basis existing under the AFIC regime. However, this should not be taken to imply that friendly societies are subject to lower prudential standards during this transition period. The development of the AFIC standards was based significantly on the existing, relevant actuarial standards set by the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board under the Life Act. Differences between the two sets of standards are intended to reflect the structural and operational differences in the respective industries.</para><para>In the longer term, it is proposed to harmonise the actuarial standards for all companies registered under the Life Insurance Act to the extent appropriate given these structural differences between friendly societies and other life companies.</para><para>The arrangements will retain the distinct identity of friendly societies so that the industry differentiation can continue. This enhances choice to consumers. For example, the unique benefit fund structure and rules of friendly societies are to be recognised in legislation.</para><para>Other changes open up opportunities for the development of new prudentially regulated products under the life insurance regime. In particular, companies will be able to have certain insurance, annuity or financial benefit business declared to be life insurance business so that it can be offered in 
 a prudentially regulated environment alongside other life insurance business.</para><para>Consistent with the thrust of the first stage of the financial sector resform, APRA's powers will be enhanced to facilitate early intervention in the life insurance market. Prudential requirements will be able to be set to better match the profile of the life insurer.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Miscellaneous amendments</inline></para><para>The bill proposes a number of minor miscellaneous amendments to several acts, correcting previous drafting errors and improving clarity within those acts. In addition:</para><para>.	 States and Territories will be able to confer powers and functions on ASIC which, prior to the regulatory transfer, were performed by State and Territories in relation to transferring financial institutions.</para><para>.	 Friendly societies that operate both life insurance business and health insurance business will be able to be jointly regulated under the two regimes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Consequential amendments</inline></para><para>Madam President, the bill proposes a number of consequential amendments to various acts to amend references to `friendly societies', `credit unions' and `building societies' where necessary and appropriate.</para><para>The bill also provides transferring institutions 18 months in which to obtain necessary approvals under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998.</para><para>Amendments to the taxation laws will ensure appropriate taxation treatment of transferring friendly societies, including for RSA business.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Transitional, Saving and Application Provisions</inline></para><para>To ensure the smooth transfer of institutions to the Commonwealth, the bill proposes a number of transitional, saving and application provisions. These provisions include the transfer of staff to APRA, the transfer of assets and liabilities from State and Territory regulatory bodies to APRA and ASIC as appropriate, the granting of authorities and approvals for the use of business names, and transitional provisions relating to unclaimed moneys.</para><para>The provisions include a number of transitional regulation-making powers which are intended to be of limited duration and which need to be developed in consultation with the States and Territories and industry.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (TRANSFERS OF BUSINESS) BILL 1999</para><para>In transferring responsibility from the States and Territories to the Commonwealth, the Common 
 wealth was aware that there were some parts of State and Territory laws which were not allowed for under the Commonwealth regime.</para><para>The State and Territory regulated entities—such as building societies, credit unions and friendly societies—along with the Commonwealth, were keen to ensure that these groups were not disadvantaged by the transfer. In fact, the Commonwealth's view was that some of these provisions were very useful prudential regulation tools.</para><para>Transfers of Business was one such power. Under the State and Territory legislation, building societies, credit unions and friendly societies were able to transfer their business amongst themselves with the approval of the regulator. The Commonwealth is keen to provide a similar mechanism as it will provide an efficient and effective prudential tool for protecting depositors or policy owner monies where their institution is in severe financial hardship. It is also good to facilitate change in the industry.</para><para>This bill contains that proposed mechanism.</para><para>As a result, the Commonwealth has carried over this useful prudential tool and extended it to all authorised deposit taking institutions and also all life insurance companies.</para><para>There are two types of transfer of business. The first is voluntary—where two entities apply to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to transfer part or all of one entity's business to the other. If APRA is satisfied that the transfer is in the interests of depositors or policy owners, and other criteria are satisfied, then with the approval of the Minister, APRA may approve the transfer.</para><para>The second type of transfer of business is a compulsory transfer. These can only be done in limited circumstances, where the transfer is in the interests of policy owners or depositors. It is expected that in circumstances such as severe financial hardship, where an entity was no longer able to meet it's financial requirements, APRA may seek the agreement of a receiving body to accept the business of the transferring body, and thus protect the interests of depositors or policy owners.</para><para>This is a proven effective and useful prudential tool that will complement APRA's other powers under the Banking Act 1959 and the Life Insurance Act 1995.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT (RSAs PROVIDED BY REGISTERED ORGANIZATIONS) BILL 1999</para><para>The accompanying bill dealing with the transfer of financial institutions from the State to the Commonwealth regulatory regime provides for 
 friendly societies that operate benefit fund business to become regulated as life insurance companies. By becoming life companies under Commonwealth legislation, friendly societies will be able to seek approval to be a retirement savings account (RSA) institution so as to provide RSA business.</para><para>Therefore, the transfer of friendly societies into the Commonwealth regime opens up opportunities for the industry to conduct new business. This outcome will be achieved by having friendly societies enter a competitively neutral financial market. New entry into the RSA market increases competition for retirement savings products and expands the choice available to consumers.</para><para>This also means that another Wallis Report recommendation will be met—recommendation 43 that sought the extension of the right to offer RSAs to other APRA regulated institutions.</para><para>A necessary consequence of this extension of RSA business is to provide appropriate tax treatment for RSA business of friendly societies and other registered organizations. The accompanying bill includes amendments to the taxation legislation to achieve this. This bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to specify the rates of tax that apply to the RSA business of friendly societies and other registered organizations. The RSA business of friendly societies and other registered organizations will be taxed at the same rate that applies to the RSA business of competing entities, including life insurance companies and banks.</para><para>In particular, income credited by a friendly society to an RSA will be taxed at the 15 per cent rate applying to complying superannuation savings. Any profit generated by the friendly society will be taxed at the company tax rate.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned till the first day of the winter sittings 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3503</page.no><id.no>r750</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>3503</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives intimating that it had not made the amendment requested by the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that the message be considered in the committee of the whole forthwith.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives message—</inline></para><para>Schedule of the request by the Senate for an amendment

A request was also made to the House of Representatives to overcome the deficiency that the proposal for surgery to be permitted outside a hospital or day procedures centre setting should be made available to public patients as well as to those who are privately insured. The House has declined to act on this request.</para></talk.start><para>After further discussions, the government has now accepted that the objections and issues raised by the opposition and other non-government senators need further consideration. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care—through the Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet in his stead—for deciding to withdraw 
 part 5 of the bill, which contained the provisions for approved facilities for out-of-hospital surgery.</para><para>As the shadow minister foreshadowed in the debate in the House over the request, this is the action that the opposition would have taken. We will now agree with the government. If the minister wishes to persist with out-of-hospital surgery, he should come back with a more developed proposal which clarifies exactly which procedures will be carried out, what the fees are likely to be, how public patients will be catered for, how quality standards will be set and enforced, how many approved facilities he envisages being established and how approved facilities will operate to complement the existing services provided in day surgeries.</para><para>I will conclude by briefly summarising our position on the rest of the bill. The opposition agrees with the proposal in part 1 of the bill to discount rates of contributions where there are administrative savings. The opposition also agrees with the proposals in part 2 to provide for loyalty bonus schemes. The proposals in relation to waiting periods in part 3 are acceptable with the amendments that the government accepted when the bill was last debated in the Senate. The opposition supports the inquiry announced by the government into the pre-existing ailment rule. This is a positive response to the anomalies in that rule that were raised by Senators Margetts and Harradine.</para><para>The opposition has supported the amendments in part 4 in relation to coverage of pharmaceutical gap payments. In the debate we made a series of points on how such a scheme needs to be confined to avoid rorting if large quantities of pharmaceuticals are prescribed whilst the person is in hospital and the person is then taken home. This proposal is limited to situations where the medicines are provided on a policy providing for no gaps. There should not be an extension of the provision to allow any wider coverage being given to pharmaceutical gap payments. It is understood that it is the government's intention to maintain this limit and that the problem of misuse will be dealt with by regulations. We also welcome the deletion of 
 schedule 3, which dealt with deregulation of private health insurance premiums, and part 6, which provided for a poorly thought through scheme to allow specialists to cover gap payments through private health insurance if they entered into contracts with health funds.</para><para>In summary, the opposition will be voting for the motion not to press the request and to reconsider the bill. We will be voting for parts 1 to 4 standing as part of the bill; we will be voting against part 5 standing as part of the bill; and we will be voting to substitute a new schedule 2, which I think the government will move, to replace the existing schedule 2.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Knowles)</name></talker><para>—The first question is that the motion moved by Senator Heffernan be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question now is that part 5 of schedule 1 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para><para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>(2)	 Schedule 2, page 15 (line 3) to page 18 (line 6), omit the Schedule, substitute:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Schedule 2—Amendment of the National Health Act 1953 related to the amendments made by Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">1 After section 5A</inline></para><para>	 Insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">5AB Changes in the instruments of a registered organization relating to rates of contribution</inline></para><para>		 If a registered organization changes its constitution, its articles of association or its rules so that the constitution, articles or rules as changed:</para><para>		 (a)	 provide, or purport to provide, for discounted rates of contribution to the health benefit fund conducted by that organization; or</para><para>		 (b)	 implement, or purport to implement, loyalty bonus schemes of the kind referred to in paragraph (ma) of Schedule 1 for certain contributors to the health benefits fund contributed by that organization;

The seasonal work waiting period was introduced by the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 1997, and applies to seasonal workers applying for Newstart allowance, youth allowance, mature age allowance, parenting payment for married people and partner allowance who have been engaged in such work in the six months prior to claiming one of these payments and who have earned above average weekly ordinary time earnings from that work—currently $736.70 gross per week.</para><para>The act defines seasonal work as (a) work that, because of its nature or factors peculiar to the industry in which it is performed, is available at approximately the same time or times every year for part or parts only of the year, or (b) work that is intermittent and is 
 determined by disallowable instrument to be seasonal work.</para><para>Under the government's original proposal, the length of the period was calculated by determining how much in excess of average earnings the person made while engaged in seasonal work and dividing the excess by the average earnings figure to arrive at a period of weeks. This ignored the fact that some seasonal workers work for intermittent periods and support themselves during intervening periods before claiming a social security payment. It also failed to take account of the fact that some seasonal workers such as shearers who travel from job to job have unusually high employment-related expenses.</para><para>The government agreed to amend the provisions to deal with these issues, and we supported the measures as amended. I understand that the original provisions were aimed at seasonal workers and certain industries where people can earn very substantial amounts of money in short periods each year and claim benefits for much of the remainder of the year. In some cases, seasonal workers can earn considerably more than average yearly earnings in well under 12 months and can then apply for Newstart allowance; and they can do this year in, year out. Of course, they may be subject to other waiting periods under the Social Security Act, but they could still receive benefits for substantial parts of the year if it were not for the seasonal work waiting period.</para><para>Despite the baseless accusations made recently by the government, Labor is not about allowing people to take advantage of the system in this way. That is why we supported the original measures once the government had agreed with our proposed amendments concerning workers who support themselves between periods of work and workers who have high employment costs. What we are opposing is the government's extension of the seasonal work waiting period to casual and contract workers in virtually every industry, regardless of their average yearly earnings or whether they have any job security. It is an important matter because of the increase in contract and occasional work 
 and the number of people who operate on that basis. That is the effect of this instrument.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—That is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—Senator Newman, you will get your go to reply.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—I just cannot believe you would say that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—As I say, Senator Newman, you will get your turn.

It is no longer aimed at workers who are routinely engaged in extremely lucrative employment for the same short period every year. Some casual workers who would come within the definition contained in the disallowable instrument might wait for many months before securing a relatively short period of highly paid work. These workers may struggle through months of poverty over the year and have no idea if or when they might find such work again.</para><para>Casual teachers are an example. I understand there are something in the order of 20,000 casual teachers in New South Wales alone. New teachers may have to wait up to three or four years before finding a permanent position and face very uncertain employment prospects in the interim. In some areas there is a shortage of casual teaching positions and work is hard to come by. Some of these teachers have significant teaching experience and can make well over average earnings when they are lucky enough to find work. But their income over the whole year may be well below the average wage.</para><para>As with other waiting periods, the seasonal work waiting period is subject to hardship 
 provisions, but the conditions under which the waiting period can be waived are stringent. Before waiver can be considered, the person must be in severe financial hardship due to unavoidable or reasonable expenditure. A single person will not be regarded as being in severe financial hardship unless their liquid assets are less than the equivalent of two weeks of the allowance they are applying for, plus rent assistance and pharmaceutical allowance if they qualify for these amounts. This can be as little as $323.40 for a single Newstart Allowance claimant. It effectively means that the waiting period will not be waived if the person has managed to save a reasonable amount to help them through the next period of unemployment, which may well be lengthy. Clearly, people in this position will try to do that. That would be the only prudent thing for them to do.</para><para>The effect of the seasonal work waiting period on casual workers may be much harsher than the rules applying to permanent employees who lose their employment. For example, the income maintenance period for a person who has lost their permanent employment will be equal to the number of weeks of leave they are entitled to. If they took their leave as they became entitled to it, they would probably have to wait no more than four weeks to become entitled to a social security benefit, regardless of how long they had been working or how much they had earned. If that person had savings of $2,500 or less at the time they became unemployed, they would not be affected by the liquid assets test.</para><para>By contrast, a casual worker who had been unemployed for eight months before obtaining casual work for four months at 1½ times the average weekly earnings could be subject to a waiting period of two months. Reduction of the waiting period on the basis of hardship could not even be considered while they have savings in excess of $323. In short, this measure will often single out casual workers and treat them more harshly than those with a permanent job, who might well have had that job for a long period of time. This may be fair enough in cases where workers earn above average yearly earnings over short 
 periods each year and claim social security entitlements for the remainder of the year, but it is simply inequitable when it applies equally to workers who are without employment for much of the year, have no job security and earn less than average wages over a 12-month period.</para><para>On the other hand, Labor understand that there are some casual and contract workers whose circumstances accord with the original rationale for the rule. These workers are fortunate enough to secure reasonably regular highly paid employment which provides them with an above average yearly income and allows them to claim social security benefits for other periods during the year. It is for this reason that we support a modified version of the current proposal which would allow it to meet the original intention of the rule while not penalising those casual workers who have no job security and earn low incomes over the year taken as a whole.</para><para>Our suggestion is that casual workers whose average income over the 12 months before claiming a social security benefit is less than the average earnings figure should not be regarded as seasonal workers for the purpose of the act. This would protect any workers who are effectively on low incomes despite having occasional periods of highly paid work. However, it would not protect those who are genuinely high income earners.</para><para>This is not just an issue about fairness; it is also about work incentives. It could be argued that casual workers who earn significantly more than average yearly wages in short periods will not be discouraged from doing such work because they will no longer be able to receive benefits. But the situation for casual workers on low yearly incomes is very different, regardless of whether they earn those incomes in relatively short spurts of high paid work. The fact that they will receive less benefit from that work as a result of this disallowable instrument can only reduce the incentive for them to take up that work. The fact that waiver of the waiting period will be considered only if they have virtually no savings from their work would surely make many of these workers wonder 
 what the point of accepting the work might be.</para><para>We must not forget the real value of casual work. It not only takes people off welfare dependency in the short term, but it also increases the worker's confidence, skills and overall employability and can lead to further work in the longer term. Perhaps we do not need to encourage people who perform very lucrative work at the same time every year and who have incomes well in excess of what most people earn over an entire year, but for those whose employment prospects are less certain and who have struggled for the most part of the year on low incomes, we must provide every encouragement possible.</para><para>In conclusion, we do support moves to restrict access to benefits to those seasonal workers who earn a reasonable income during the year. We supported that when it was proposed, and we continue to support that position, but we are not in favour of cutting benefits to those who are genuinely qualified by virtue of their taking up casual work as it becomes available, even if that is relatively high income work at that particular period. Because of the demand that occurs in our society for specialist skills and the increase in contract work, there are large numbers of workers who do avail themselves of short contract work that may well be reasonably well rewarded but is only available for a short time. We think the government has not done enough to cover the circumstances of all those who may be affected by this measure.</para><para>I accept that the disallowance motion is a blunt instrument, but the opposition, through discussion with the government, have been unable to resolve the issue any other way. We would like to see a way through this but, as we have not been able to get the government to come up with a compromise which we think would meet the concerns that we have raised and the government's genuine policy objectives about cutting out those who should not be entitled, we have no option but to move the disallowance.</para><para>I have been alerted today that there is some concern from the government about the timing of the measure coming on today. I only point out that it has been on the books 
 since Wednesday, 17 February. I understand there was some communication difficulty, but I have been postponing it for a number of days. We are running out of time to deal with this. It seems to me it is in the government's interest it is dealt with. Anyway, I think that is a minor point. I indicate that there was a problem in communication, and I apologise for that, but it seems to me it has been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for a considerable period of time. It is important that the matter be resolved and we are keen to do that before Easter.</para><para>In moving this disallowance, the opposition think this would at least force the government to reconsider the issues around the sorts of people that I have identified today and ensure that regulations they bring before the parliament do not unfairly impact on people in those circumstances. We accept the need for the general seasonal work rules—we supported them then and we support them now. We are disappointed that the government see fit to seek cheap publicity in the press by accusing us of not supporting those measures, but that is their call.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—But it is not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—Well, I read the press, Senator Newman.

This measure of penalising seasonal workers who earn above average weekly earnings by making it harder for them to get unemployment benefits or unemployment payments and imposing a longer waiting period on them is one that the Democrats opposed when it was brought in in June last year.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats do not believe it is an appropriate measure for seasonal workers to have a higher hurdle than other workers in terms of waiting periods. For that reason, the 
 Democrats will be supporting this disallowance motion. We believe it will broaden out the number of people who are caught in this measure even further.</para><para>In terms of the concerns that Senator Evans was expressing, I am not quite sure, when the Labor Party supported this government measure back in June last year, exactly what they thought would happen with this measure. Who did they think would be affected by it and who did they think would not be? In the second reading debate on the bill back in May last year, I expressed the Democrats' opposition to the proposed changes relating to seasonal workers, and said that they would include such workers as fruit-pickers, shearers, casual teachers and people who perform locum roles in various jobs. It was pretty clear at the time, certainly to the Democrats, that people such as these were likely to get caught up in this measure.</para><para>Indeed, as I imagine Senator Newman recalls, probably not half an hour after the bill was actually passed Senator George Campbell, on behalf of the Labor Party, stood up and asked a question in question time which expressed concern about construction workers being affected by this proposed measure, which his own party had supported less than half an hour earlier in this very chamber. Not surprisingly, Senator Newman gave that question fairly short shrift in response.</para><para>I found it fairly astonishing at the time that the ALP did support the measure, and I will quote former Senator Neal, who was the spokesperson at the time. I guess that lets Senator Evans off the hook, because it is was not his responsibility, as indeed it was not Mr Swan's responsibility in the other place, either; it was the responsibility of the previous spokespersons for the ALP. But Senator Neal at the time said:</para><para>The opposition does believe it is appropriate to take into account the income of those who may have up and down periods because of seasonal work. We do not agree with the Democrats' view that those particular people should be omitted from the income testing . . . </para><para>I should hasten to add that that is not actually our view. Our view is that they should have the same income testing as everybody else. 
 Seasonal workers, broadly speaking, are not likely to be better off than people who have permanent jobs. Whilst I am sure there is a very small proportion of people who get huge amounts of money and are able to spend the rest of the year living in luxury—and I think it would be a very small proportion of people—I do not see how, firstly, you can determine a measure which separates out those people from other people who are just getting seasonal, casual or locum work where they can. Clearly, a lot of these sorts of jobs occur in rural and regional areas—not all of them, but a reasonable proportion of them.</para><para>The Democrats and I think most parties certainly espouse the need to encourage employment in regional areas. We have had issues in recent times of illegal non-residents being caught working as fruit-pickers in parts of Australia and the people who employ them saying that they cannot find people to do those jobs. I do not know how difficult it is to find fruit-pickers in various areas—obviously it is easier in some areas than in others. But measures such as this which actually penalise people further and make them face an extra waiting period or an extra test before they can access income support obviously are not going to provide an extra incentive for those sorts of people to engage in such work.</para><para>The determination we are debating at the moment which it is proposed be disallowed—and I reiterate that the Democrats support that disallowance—extends the seasonal work waiting period to a huge range of industries, such as managers, administrators, professionals, associate professionals, tradespersons, clerical and sales and service workers, production and transport workers and labourers and related workers. That is a pretty wide range of people and, certainly, I think you would be hard pressed to say that a lot of those people are somehow or other getting away with something unfair—rorting the system or living the high life or whatever might be implied. I think the very vast proportion of those people who will be caught up in this measure are simply people who are trying to get work where they can and are not likely to be in what would be called a high 
 income bracket over a prolonged period of time. Certainly all of those people—and that will include people who are in lower income brackets—will clearly be caught by this measure. It is for that reason that the Democrats opposed it initially and why we maintain a consistent position in opposing this determination.</para><para>I believe the opposition suggests that this determination represents a substantial departure from the original rationale for the rule as it is no longer aimed at workers who are routinely engaged in extremely lucrative employment. I do not see anything in the wording of the act or in the original speech—or for that matter in anything when the matter initially came up—that suggests it is significantly different from what is contained in this determination, that it does represent a substantial departure. I think it is a broadening—somewhat more than one might have interpreted from the wording of the act, but it is certainly not what I would call a substantial departure. I would see it as an unhelpful broadening, perhaps catching even more people than one might have anticipated from an initial reading of the act.</para><para>I cannot see how the opposition see it as being something massively different from what they initially agreed to when this measure was put into law in June last year. It does baffle me. Casual teachers, as indeed the construction workers who Senator George Campbell provided as an example in his question not long after the bill went through, are examples of people who are clearly going to be potentially caught by this measure. They are absolutely, definitely caught by this measure under this determination in terms of labourers and professionals. Again, I just cannot see how this is seen as somehow or other being a massive departure from what was initially intended. I guess in that sense I would probably understand if there was a little perplexity or frustration from the government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—The people in this are not seasonal.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—The act defines seasonal work as the Senate applied it—that work that is intermittent and is determined to 
 be seasonal or that is available at approximately the same time or times every year for part or parts only of the year. And I think that sort of thing can easily be interpreted by the department. It is a pretty broad definition which gives a lot of room for interpretation. Again using examples such as teachers, it would be quite easy to say that it occurs at similar times of the year—it occurs at the times of the year when school is in, not at the times of the year when school is out.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other issue is that there is no specific original indication, either in the original measure or in this determination, that it was somehow or other targeting people in extremely lucrative employment. It was targeting anyone who earned anything over average weekly earnings, despite the fact that they only earned that money for a proportion of the year. By definition, seasonal work or non-permanent, regular casual work is work that is not going to bring in an income all year round unless people are able to bounce directly from one job to the next. Those people are often in a more difficult situation, as I said previously, than permanent workers. To suggest that somehow or other they are getting away with more than everybody else is something that the Democrats find fairly baffling.</para><para>It is a measure the Democrats did not support when it came in. For that reason we certainly do not support any determination that extends in any way the measure. It is one that we believe should not be there in the first place. We believe it is just another in a string of enforced poverty measures that we have seen over the past few years, basically requiring people to provide their own personal unemployment insurance from their earnings when they get casual or regular seasonal work. There are plenty of other measures—existing income and assets tests and the taxation system—which apply to people when they earn a significant amount of money. </para><para>To catch the very small number of people who are somehow earning a fortune in a very short time, we are, through this measure and the initial inclusion of it in the act, catching a lot of people who could not possibly be seen to be earning lucrative amounts of 
 money. It is something we found difficult to see a justification for initially and we certainly do not see any now. For that reason the Democrats will support the disallowance. I do wish the extent of the concerns that the ALP see now were realised at the time the measure was put into law in June last year—then we would not be having this debate now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3510</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again this chamber is being held to ransom by what can only be now termed the wholly-owned subsidiary of the union movement—the Australian Labor Party. In the past few weeks we have had a plethora of motions from the other side designed to reassure their former masters—and I have to say `former masters' because 67 per cent of Labor senators have come up through the union ranks. I have nothing against that as a legitimate career path, but it does seem a bit excessive when 67 per cent of a group here are former union officials. It would pay the Labor Party to look very carefully at their preselections and perhaps preselect people with some broader experience who are not as likely to kowtow to their former masters.</para></talk.start><para>While I usually find the posturing of Labor Party members on the other side who are at the beck and call of the unions pathetic, I find today's disallowance motion from Senator Evans particularly odious. This disallowance is designed to advantage highly unionised, highly privileged workers against less unionised and less privileged workers. That is what is happening today. Let me say it again: it is a disallowance motion designed to advantage highly unionised, highly privileged workers against less unionised and less privileged workers. The ALP has caved in under pressure from the CFMEU. The CFMEU includes workers who are able to negotiate lucrative short-term contracts—often in the construction industry or in industries where they have a contract they can undertake over a limited period of time and earn substantial amounts of money. Let us be very clear: the instrument the opposition is moving to disallow is designed to block access to unemployment payments for people who earn high incomes for 
 parts of the year then spend or dispose of their income in some way to avoid the liquid assets test.</para><para>What Labor do not understand, if I am being kind, or what they do not want to understand, if I am being less kind, is that for work to be classed as intermittent or seasonal it must fulfil three criteria. The first criterion is that it must be for less than 12 months. The second criterion is that it must be performed by a person who has been engaged to do a specific project or task or for a set period. The third criterion is that, if the work is performed by a person who accrues leave entitlements, it will not be classified as seasonal work and hence will not be affected by the initiative. All three of these criteria—not one of them; all three of them—must be satisfied for the work to be classified as seasonal. Most work performed by part-time or casual employees will not be affected by the seasonal worker initiative because most casual or part-time workers are not receiving the high incomes that would affect their unemployment payments.</para><para>Labor have continually refused to understand the simple truth that this is a fair measure. They have sought to misguide, mislead and misinform the Australian public about the true effect of this measure. The real question today is: why should anyone who earns over $100,000 on a six-month contract be able to spend the money and then claim a holiday at the taxpayers' expense for the next six months? It is totally unacceptable.</para><para>It is important to remember that workers who are unemployed prior to taking up employment can remain registered for newstart allowance for up to six fortnights after commencing work, even though their income would preclude them for payment. The formula for calculating the preclusion period provided in legislation ensures that only those workers earning more than average weekly ordinary time earnings will be affected. This disallowable instrument determines only the kind of intermittent work that is to be treated as if it were seasonal. The length of the preclusion period is calculated according to a formula based on the average weekly ordinary time earnings last published by the 
 ABS in the calendar year prior to claim. Currently this amount is $736.70 per week. We are saying that single people earning less than $736.70 a week or $1,473.40 per fortnight will not have a waiting period applied.</para><para>For the opposition to come in here and say they are talking about people on low incomes is a nonsense. Let me say that again: single people earning less than $736.70 a week or $1,473.40 a fortnight will not have a waiting period applied. Couples earning less than $1,473.40 a week or $2,946.80 a fortnight will not have the waiting period applied. I ask honourable senators, particularly the Democrats and the Greens, to think about that. The Labor Party cannot come in here and say that this is affecting people on low incomes; it is not. We are saying that people who have similar incomes over a period of time ought to be treated the same.</para><para>When we came into government we found that—and we knew about this when we were in opposition—a lot of the social security benefits were riddled with anomalies associated with older people on the pension and people receiving unemployment benefits. To be fair, we need to treat people in similar circumstances with similar incomes in the same way for the purposes of receiving benefits. I think most fair-minded Australians would agree.</para><para>The ALP's alternative proposal is that intermittent workers' income should be calculated over a 12-month period and that the worker would be treated as a seasonal worker only if the income was more than an average income, that is, average weekly ordinary time earnings, for the year. This would create a gross inequity in the treatment of seasonal and intermittent workers. Intermittent workers would be treated far more generously than seasonal workers. Of course, many of those seasonal workers are less likely to be unionised than intermittent workers. What we are seeing is that these people would be treated quite differently and unfairly. For example, a single person receiving newstart for six months and then earning $30,000 for six months work would have total earnings in the 12 months prior to the claim of around $34,000, which is lower than average weekly 
 earnings for a year. If the person had been engaged in seasonal work, they would have a preclusion period of 14 weeks, whereas if the ALP's proposal was adopted and they had been doing intermittent work such as contract work, they would not be precluded at all. I cannot see how you can justify that.

If the government want to do that then they should come to the Senate with legislation which can be the subject of scrutiny and amendment by the Senate. Again and again Senator Patterson's contribution was that we should treat all workers the same. Quite clearly, the government are not treating all workers the same. In this particular case I guess what they are saying is, `We are treating one group of workers, seasonal workers, badly and we would like to treat all workers just as badly as we are treating seasonal workers.' That is not a particularly good strategy, as far as I am concerned.</para></talk.start><para>The act defines seasonal work as, and I paraphrase, work that is available at approximately the same time or times every year for part or parts only of the year, or work that is intermittent and is determined, by disallowable instrument, to be seasonal work. The second part of the definition does not, however, give free rein to the government to call anything it likes seasonal work. It is intermittent work that is referred to. This determination would extend it to include almost any short-term, occasional, one-off period of work for which an individual was paid more than average weekly earnings. This goes well beyond the commonsense understanding of seasonal work, which is usually identified with activities such as crayfishing or shearing.</para><para>Coming at this sort of change by a determination is an underhand way of bringing in changes which have the potential to impact quite extensively on potential recipients of a wide variety of social security payments, including newstart allowance, youth allowance, parenting payment or partner allowance. In effect, it begins to treat all kinds of casual and contract workers in virtually every industry as seasonal workers, and its impact extends from managers and professionals to labourers and production workers. The extension of the definition of seasonal work particularly impacts on the waiting period—the period before benefits can be paid. It is during this period that people in need of assistance are most vulnerable to hardship.</para><para>Given the sorts of changes we are seeing in the nature of employment across the board, this particular change will affect more and more workers. Work is becoming much more impermanent. Casual work is more common. Short-term contracts are becoming the norm. It is not unusual nowadays for workers to have a relatively short period of highly paid work after being out of work for a considerable time. This does not actually mean that those people need to eat less during the times of unemployment. It does not necessarily mean that somehow these people are automatically rorting the system. It does not mean that these people should be considered to be people who are cheating the system. That is basically what this government is doing.</para><para>The work comes along and people pay off the debts that they may have accumulated. They manage okay for a few weeks but they do not necessarily have the capacity to put away the sorts of savings that someone permanently on that income would do. In short, they might not be in any position to support themselves or their family for any extended waiting period before being able to access benefits. The appropriate way to deal with this kind of situation would be to average out people's total income over the previous 12 months. If they were still over average weekly earnings, it might be appropriate to have waiting periods.</para><para>But the current proposal makes no such allowance. People in short-term employment will be exposed to waiting periods which, in some instances, could actually be longer than those of people who have lost permanent employment. Instead of a waiting period equivalent to their accrued annual leave—usually four weeks—casual workers who are treated as seasonal may have to wait considerably longer. For a worker who had, say, four months work after a long period of unemployment, this delay could easily be two months or more.</para><para>Constantly we were hearing from Senator Patterson that we on this side of the chamber were talking about supporting the union. The reality is, as Senator Evans interjected on several occasions, that the figures do not back 
 this up. The level of union membership amongst casual workers is—as Senator Patterson could find out if she checked—very low.</para><para>People will also be disadvantaged by the tougher rules on exemption from the waiting period that usually applies to seasonal work. I know it is difficult for the coalition to understand that we on this side of the chamber might actually be doing this because it is the right and fair thing to do, not because we are necessarily instructed by a particular interest group. If workers or the people out in the community are concerned about this, they have a legitimate right to be heard.</para><para>Whereas the former permanent worker can have $2,500 in the bank before the liquid assets test applies, the casual worker—the worker you want to pretend is a seasonal worker—cannot get any reduction in waiting period even if they have as little as $323 in savings. So what we are doing? We are making sure that people are actually turned away from taking up any work opportunities. This includes, I would think, some graduates who are desperate to get work in their actual profession. Yes, this might mean that they might get short-term work—consultancy or whatever—at a relatively higher wage package. However, this might also mean that they have to wait a long time before they get other similar experience.</para><para>It is no wonder, as the Melbourne Institute showed us today, that the participation rate of students in Australia is reducing in terms of people wanting to go into tertiary education. This is because, as one would have to think, that people are looking into the future and wondering whether or not they are going to be able to use the skills for which they are trained.</para><para> The workers we are talking about could well be suffering hardship, in the normal sense of the word, and still not be able to access the hardship provisions which, as far as seasonal work is concerned, are extremely strict. Coming at this sort of change by a determination is, as I said, an underhand way of bringing in changes which have the potential to impact quite extensively on the potential recipients of a wide variety of social 
 security payments. As such, it should be disallowed by the Senate.</para><para>I want to bring in another issue. Commonsense would say that in a time of high unemployment, which is what we still have in Australia, you do not make it more difficult for people to participate in the work force. You do not actually penalise people for working for short periods of time. You do not make it so that, somehow or other, there is an assumption that, if you work full time, you are necessarily better or that you get rewarded for that but, if you manage to get short-term work or seasonal work, somehow you are penalised.</para><para>The government have to make up their mind whether they are actually on the side of the people in this country who want to work. They often say they are, but here they are penalising people who will take up work for short periods of time or have the opportunity for short periods of time to take up work. It simply makes no commonsense. What they are doing might mean that some people's choice will be not to take up that offer—and that would be very sad in terms of experience, wasted human capital in Australia and the actual implications for people which the government are refusing to see. They are refusing to see that there are real human consequences from the hard-hearted, cold approach that they are taking to anyone who happens to be able to currently access social security payments. Therefore I urge the Senate to support this disallowance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3514</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate—and I know Senator Evans did advert to this in an indirect way—that Mr Swan from the shadow minister's office actually gave a commitment that there would be one day's warning before debate on the disallowance.

Senator Bartlett acknowledged that the disallowable instrument was not a substantial departure from the legislation. It is important that that be on the record. The sad thing about this is that the CFMEU, and maybe some of 
 the other unions, have seen fit to pressure the Labor Party to change their original position. That is what has to have happened, because we have not moved away from the purpose of the legislation and the debate that took place in the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think a question of equity between workers is an issue here. Senator Patterson has made that very clear—although Senator Margetts did not like hearing it—more than once. But that is the fact. This legislation and this disallowable instrument are based on the concept, which all governments have acknowledged over the years, that social security is a safety net based on the needs of people. If we have one group of workers who get caught by the legislation and another group who are in similar circumstances who do not, it is not equitable. If all of them have earnings that are above average weekly ordinary time earnings, then they are in the more privileged elements of our society. They are not the people for whom a social security safety net was intended by any government.</para><para>It is very clearly demonstrated by an example. In the same industry you can have a fruit-picker caught by the legislation who could have the same amount of income as the packer in the cannery who is packing the fruit that has been picked by the picker. They can both have the same amount of income over the same period. But if the motion for disallowance were to go through, the fruit-picker who is not unionised would be of no concern to the Labor Party. The packer in the cannery who is unionised would be of concern to them. That can be the only reason for the change of position by the ALP on this measure—which they supported, and said so, in the chamber.</para><para>Senator Evans also made some comments about teachers. Let me address that question. Quite interestingly, in the legislation—I hold it up for the benefit of the Senate to see what I am talking about—there is schedule 4, `Amendments relating to seasonal workers'. There is a description of seasonal work. There are parts A and B. Under part B, `Work that is intermittent and is determined to be seasonal for the purposes of this act', there are examples. Examples of work in paragraph 
 (a) are fishing, fruit picking, shearing and work in an industry that is subject to Christmas shutdowns. Examples of work that is intermittent are relief teaching and work as a locum. Where were they? We were not hiding anything from anybody. That was there.</para><para>Let me make it clear about the teachers. To be included within the scope of this measure, teachers would need to satisfy the following conditions. They would need to be employed for a set period—that is, for less than 12 months. Most of these relief teachers would be employed for a day or two, or for an indefinite period, and so would not serve the preclusion period. They would also be needing to earn more than AWOTI over the period of the work. As Senator Patterson made clear, it is $736 for a single person and $1,473 for couples. In my book, that is a pretty high wage in Australia, yet the Labor Party has gone into bat for people who are earning that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Is that right? $736 for contract work?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—It is $1,473 for a couple.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Single is $700?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—Yes, $736.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—For contract work in Kalgoorlie, working 14 hours a day.

The total number of cases where a preclusion period has been applied has been 106. For hardship, 10 cases were waived. So there has been some discussion here about the coverage of this measure. There has been some discussion also about waiving and hardship. Those are the facts out of the Centrelink administration of the scheme from 1 January to 26 March provided to me by my department from Centrelink.</para><para>I do urge the Labor Party to reconsider. Their original position was the right one. It was fair to people who are all in similar kinds of employment, and they were being treated in the same way if they earned the same income. What could be fairer than that? In addition, it is fair to the taxpayer that people who have substantial means until they have served a preclusion period should be expected to look after themselves before they ask their neighbour, the taxpayer, to support them. What ever has happened to the Labor Party? It is just incredible that you would do this somersault, this about-turn—call it what you like. Our legislation and the disallowable instrument were all based on the fair notion that high income earners who know that they will be without income for a period should put some money aside so they can provide for themselves rather than ask the taxpayer for support. Virtually all social security systems around the world have special provisions 
 relating to seasonal workers. This disallowance motion should be opposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>3518</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened very carefully to the debate thus far. I particularly understand the points that have been made by the minister, but also I was very interested in what Senator Bartlett was saying and, in particular, what Senator Margetts was saying. I heard Senator Patterson and Senator Evans also. On the balance, I am going to vote for the disallowance. Members of the opposition who have spoken are talking about a situation where they really do not know what the total outcome will be. Already the minister has indicated that there has been no real research done as to the likely effect of this measure on casual workers.</para></talk.start><para>I think a figure of $6 million in savings has been suggested. I have heard mention of figures—including figures coming out of Minister Newman's office—which do not necessarily add up. I will not refer to the last occasion when I had my fingers burnt in regard to that area. I point out that there is a growing number of casual employees in the work force at present, and the figure will grow and grow.</para><para>One of the reasons for this is the attitude of the current government. Many workers may have low average yearly incomes and no job security—that is, their work is not seasonal, yet you are bringing them into this area. I thought there were four seasons in the year, not an innumerable number of seasons, when we talk about the meaning of `seasonal work'. Many of these people—including fishermen, for example—are seasonal workers, but they know that the job will come around next year. Unless something awful happens to the world, the season will come around next year. You are lumping together all of these other people who are listed as seasonal workers.</para><para>The hardship provisions apply, but they are very strict. The liquid asset may be as little as $323.40 for a single newstart allowance claimant to meet the provisions. I believe that if the regulations are not disallowed there could be quite serious effects and, I suppose, unintended consequences.	A casual worker should not be treated worse, in this regard, 
 than a permanent worker who is retrenched. The casual worker does not have the advantage of leave and super entitlements. As I mentioned, there are going to be more and more casual workers in the work force.</para><para>By disallowing this determination, the Senate will be doing a service not only to those people who will be affected but also to the government. I think the government should take this matter back and discuss it with the parties concerned. I understand that the opposition has suggested certain things to the government which I think the government should thoroughly consider. The government should take this matter back, once it is disallowed, and enter into discussions with the opposition, if they are so sure that the opposition does not understand it, or if they are following the same principles but the practical application of the determination is adverse.

I want to make a couple of points. Firstly, I acknowledge that Senator Margetts put the case for the measure far better than I did, and I thank her for that. I think she summed up the core issues; Senator Harradine paid due respect to that. She encapsulated the case very well and that was important for the debate.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett spent most of his contribution bagging the Labor Party, as seems to be his wont, but as long as he votes with us, I am prepared to wear it. I do not know what Senator Patterson's contribution was about. She is obviously upset about trade unions in this country. I am obviously off the CFMEU friends list because they did not bother talking to me about this. It seems to me that we are talking about workers who, in my experience, are not unionised. They are generally contract and casual workers who are most vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace. It is far from being a union issue, but it seems to be the preoccupation of the government that that is what this is about.</para><para>My only personal experience of people affected by this comes from a couple of 
 representations we received from schoolteachers and one from a discussion I had with a friend who is a metalworker and who has been forced to seek work in the Goldfields because of an inability to get work in Perth. He is caught by this rule. I think he would be a bit shocked that the minister thought he was a high income earner.</para><para>The last point made by Senator Harradine is the most important one. The opposition supported the government's original approach to seasonal workers as we thought that was a fair thing to do. It was about excluding people from social security who were, by virtue of their seasonal work, not entitled to it. What we have done is put a proposition to the government that we ought to look at the earnings over the year, make a proper assessment of whether people are entitled to social security support and take a broader view of that, rather than the narrow view that the government takes—that it all depends on what they earn in a short period of time.</para><para>The reality of the world is changing. A lot of people are forced, because of unemployment and the changes in the workplace, to take short-term contract work that lacks security and has no predictability to it. They rely on what they earn from that. At times they are forced to fall back on the social security safety net if their earnings over the period are not sufficient to sustain a reasonable lifestyle.</para><para>What we have suggested to the government is that, rather than try to bulldoze this measure through, they have a look at a reasonable compromise to get what I suspect we would all agree—bar the Democrats—is a reasonable policy outcome; that is, to find a way in which those that deserve some social security support receive it and those that do not are excluded. I do not think it is beyond the wit of the Senate to do that, but we were not able to get that result from the government. Hence we have to go with, as I described before, this blunt instrument of disallowance. However, this will at least force the government to go back and look at how best we can achieve the right policy outcome.

But I bring balance, I believe, to the narrowness of the specific terms in paragraph (c) of the committee's terms of reference. As you know, this committee is a re-established one. It sat before and has looked at a wide range of issues regarding information technology.</para><para>The committee has been set up again to further the work of previous committees in evaluating the development of self-regulatory codes in the information industries and to monitor the personal, social and economic impact of continuing technological change created by industries and services utilising information technologies. The committee is to inquire into and report on other matters referred to it by the Senate. That, I believe, is a very important purpose.</para><para>We have a need in Australia, with the onrush of information technology, to put a priority on such things as the need for all homes to have access to information technology. We must ensure that all students, indeed all schools, are well serviced by information technology. This is a critical matter because we know that many homes and schools in Australia do not have such access.</para><para>We also need to look at the impact of this technology on the community at large. Many 
 people feel left out. They feel bewildered by modern information technology. Many Australians are disadvantaged. I would add that the disadvantage in information technology runs fairly roughly along the lines of those who are already poor and those who are already in minority groups—for example, groups for whom English is not their first language.</para><para>I will bring an open mind to this committee. In particular, I will be keen to see that the specific term of reference which has led to the establishment of this committee is kept in place. I refer to paragraph (c), which follows upon Senator Alston's announcement of the government's move to establish through, amongst other things, legislation coming before the parliament a means of restricting—without going into the technological terms—what can be shown and purveyed on the Internet, especially matters that encompass pornography.</para><para>There is a widespread feeling in the community that this committee is being established to clamp down on what Australians might see, hear or turn to on the Internet. Let me state at this point for the Senate's deliberation that I have concerns that, in particular, gratuitous violence ought to be kept in check. I am totally opposed to any form of entertainment or other transmission which involves the abuse of any person and the infringements of their rights and wellbeing.

I refer to the make-up of the committee as it stands. It is a committee of eight. There are already four government appointees. There will be two from the Labor Party and a Democrat. 
 That leaves the vital eighth position to either Senator Harradine, as nominated, or myself.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not want to speak for Senator Harradine on this, but I think few would argue that he is very much closer to Senator Alston and Mr Howard's point of view—that is, the government's point of view—on regulation of the Internet than I am. Therefore, it would seem, on the face of it, a very good thing to help balance the weight of this committee—not to lead to further imbalance. Already half the committee members represent the government. If Senator Harradine were elected rather than me, it would be five-three. I think the committee would lose an open mind, an inquiring mind, but a very necessary balance to the more narrow viewpoint of Senator Alston and the government appointees. On that ground, it would be judicious of the Senate to put a Green onto this committee.</para><para>There is another added ground. Both Senator Harradine and I come from Tasmania and will represent various components of the Tasmania community, but I also have a wide access through the Greens to with the whole of the Australian community. We are a vigorous, forward looking, fresh entity in politics. We are particularly concerned and open about the impact of information technology not just on this generation but on future generations. The words of Ralph Nader, the great consumer advocate who came to Launceston in 1980 during the Franklin Dam debate, are ringing in my ears. He said, `Information is the currency of democracy.' In so far as we trammel information, we trammel democracy. It is very important that we do not stray into unnecessary censoriousness or any close-down of point of view with one citizen putting his or her viewpoint across those of other citizens to censor what they may see, hear, listen to or indeed disseminate.</para><para>I am not a regular visitor to the Prime Minister's office. I am not negotiating with, nor will I be indebted to, Senator Alston or to anybody else in the government. Moreover, I have declared my hand on both the sale of more of Telstra and on the GST package. So the government has no tradeable entity with me. I ask the Senate to consider that seriously

In line with amendment No. 14, the new amendment No. 15 removes from item 8 the requirement for an employer to issue an early group certifi

Of course, neither of these amendments prevents an employer providing an early group certificate to an employee who has ceased to be employed where the employer is able to calculate the reportable fringe benefits amount. In addition, employees who cease to be employed and who do not receive any fringe benefits, or who receive fringe benefits with a total taxable value of less than $1,000, continue to be able to request an early group certificate.</para><para>The amendments have the effect that, for a very small number of employees, the maximum time between the employee ceasing to be employed by the employer and the employer giving the employee copies of the group certificate will be no longer than 15 months and two weeks.

It is obviously an issue of genuinely great importance to a lot of senators, but there is a speakers list of something like 18 people.

On the weekend I saw a news report of the Prime Minister at, I think, a Liberal Party function in Melbourne. He had once again thumped the lectern and told his assembled audience of true believers that as far as he was concerned he was not going to put up with any Senate delay and that he was going to confront the Senate about dragging out any debate on the GST legislation. He claimed a government mandate to proceed.</para><para>To that proposition I say: the Senate is not delaying. Those remarks by the Prime Minister were so much hot air in terms of public positioning of expectations—expectations, I believe, that are aimed at casting a wrong impression of what the Senate is up to. Let us resort to the facts to defend what I have just said. The decision to hold an inquiry into the government's GST legislation was a decision arrived at in this chamber, but it had its genesis in an agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats with some input, I understand, from Senator Harradine. Only after the die was cast between those players were the Labor Party brought into the story. We proposed some modifications. We were not successful in doing that and, at the end of the day, voted for the inquiry.</para><para>The important first fact deduced from the foregoing is that the initiative arose from a joint government and Australian Democrat desire to hold an inquiry in whatever form. Irrespective of the reluctance with which the government were dragged to such a decision, the truth is that they were part of it. For the 
 Prime Minister to say the Senate is dragging the chain is to deny the historic circumstances of how the inquiry arose at all.</para><para>The second salient feature of all this is that the inquiry overall was to report by the 19th of next month. It was constituted just before Christmas; it has 16 bills of legislation to examine, all involving complex legal matters concerning taxation law, and it has a range of other bills—12 or so, I think—that have since been put on the table in the Senate. Overall, the number of bills constituting this package adds up to 28. The Senate would be derelict, in my submission, in its duty if it did not proceed to examine the devil that is in the detail of such a vast number of bills introducing such sweeping changes to the tax act. The Senate inquiry mechanism has enabled the Senate for the first time to listen to the voice of the Australian community.</para><para>What we saw before the last election was a declaration by the Prime Minister that he would embark on a great new tax adventure for Australia—an adventure of his making. We saw, in secret, the preparation by the Department of the Treasury of the contents of that package. We heard, just before the Prime Minister rang the bell and said that the election was on, the content that he was proposing to the electorate. We saw then a government advertising campaign, referred to in the motion from Senator Faulkner and costing the Australian taxpayer $19.433 million, explaining to the Australian electorate or educating them on—to use the euphemistic terms employed by the government—the contents of the government's tax package. One can be cynical, but the truth about that expenditure of public moneys is that it was to put down, advertise and put in every letterbox in Australia a document which was, at the end of the day, nothing more than government propaganda on the central plank of the election campaign it called forthwith. There was no attempt to have a public debate about tax reform in Australia.</para><para>To label what the government has done—introduce a comprehensive set of bills changing the tax law—as `reform' obviously flies in the face of the proper use of that word. It is not reform; it is tax change. Whether you 
 think it is reform depends on your standpoint. Do you support the government? Do you support the welfare sector? Do you support any number of organisations that have argued in the Senate hearings against the changes? Or do you support the view of the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats in terms of calling for the massive change or the defeat of this legislation? The government cannot call it reform. Reform is not a matter of fact; it is a matter of opinion. Nonetheless, we have had shoved down our throats in the public debate that this is reform. Reform backed by a cheque for $19.433 million signed by the Australian taxpayer is indeed a piece of propaganda that kicked off the election campaign.</para><para>In the election campaign, what was the outcome? Of course, the government was returned. In terms of votes, Labor got close to 52 per cent of the total votes cast and the government got close to 48 per cent of the total votes cast. If this were a referendum on a GST, Labor would have defeated the government, because the government did not get a majority of votes in a majority of states. So, if it were a referendum, the government would not have had a mandate. Whether or not all those people who voted for either party voted solely on this matter is a matter for subjective assessment. I cannot say that it is true that they did, but there is no doubt that this was the centrepiece of the election campaign. So, to the question of whether or not the tax package is fairly before us with a mandate, I say it is not and that this Senate chamber, which has to deal with the legislation, ought not approach it as if there were a cast-iron, watertight mandate for the government. If there is delay, the delay is in the government agreeing to the inquiry before it consulted us, in the face of whatever our views were. So it is not right for the Prime Minister to make the public allegation about Senate delay that he has made, but I do expect that we will hear a lot more of that sort of thing before the Senate settles down and considers this legislation.</para><para>I want to canvass fairly briefly but in short summary to give an overview of the sort of evidence that has come before the Senate 
 committee that I have chaired, the Senate select committee into this legislation. Of course, the full report of this committee will come down on 19 April and comprehensively express the views of the various participants in the inquiry. I do not speak for anyone other than myself and I do not speak in completion of a full consideration of all the evidence, because key evidence is yet to be educed. Some of that key evidence, which I think will be fundamental and on which will turn a lot of judgments in the Australian community, is evidence from work commissioned by the Senate inquiry into the distributional effects of the GST; in other words, let us look at how the government package affects middle and low income earners, not according to the way the government put it out in the package, financed by this $19.433 million election campaign, but rather how independent modelling, taking the most reasonable assumptions, values the government package. We can see then whether or not the assertions made to the electorate before the election are held to be true under independent scrutiny and analysis. But that is yet to come, and I do not know what that survey will find. I do expect, though, that it will not be comfortable for the government. That is a view of mine which may or may not be borne out.</para><para>The evidence given to our inquiry which I think ought to be the first stop for any analysis up to this stage of the inquiry is that given by the Taxation Institute of Australia. The Taxation Institute of Australia is a body which consists of professional experts in taxation. It is not a political body; it owes no political allegiance anywhere. It actually concentrates on being professional and expert in assessing the implications of tax law. Its membership is made up of people who have got the necessary qualifications to be taxation advisers, accountants and experts in helping in the preparation of taxation returns and understanding the implications of tax law.</para><para>They do not in their evidence express a view one way or another about the legislation the government proposes. They shrink from doing that lest their opinion be used in political debate. They prefer to be experts, saying, `If that is what the community has decided 
 then we will comment on whether the translation of that intent into legislation effectively and adequately succeeds in delivering what was meant in the first place.' That is, they are experts on technicality and they are experts on the detail. They do not make value judgments on what motivates the legislation, they look at its effectiveness.</para><para>What evidence did they give to our hearing? They gave this evidence. They said that there is so much devil in the detail of this legislation that if you supported the government's view then you would in fact defer the operative date of this legislation by between six and 12 months so that there could be a proper assessment of sorting this sort of detail out, and make sure that the government's intentions as enunciated were in fact properly translated into legislation to come before the parliament. They believe there is considerable devil in the detail. They believe that the bills that we will have to consider are not what the government intended and would introduce a whole range of complexity, a whole range of costs and a whole range of interpretative difficulty in working out what the true meaning is, if they were to come forward in their present form.</para><para>They are still in the process of going through this and articulating carefully and professionally what that detail is. They do expect to be in conference with the government to explain their views and they do expect, as they said in evidence before us, that there will be a number of substantive amendments to the government legislation as well. We cannot inquire into what those amendments will be, because they are likely to arise after we have reported. But the bills before us, on their evidence at least, are going to be changed and changed in ways that at this stage we do not know about, and that is an important consideration. But the fundamental point I want to educe from all the above is that the expert body in this nation that comments on these things regards the legislation as flawed, and flawed in a manner that would require any earnest advocate of it to delay until those changes were made and the legislation was sorted out. That is the first and I think most important piece of evidence 
 given to us by the Taxation Institute—as I was saying, an expert body.</para><para>The next piece of evidence that I would like to refer to is that given by the Insurance Council of Australia. The Insurance Council of Australia is an industry body consisting of insurance companies and brokers in Australia. The council simply represent their point of view. They in fact said on the record that they support the intent of the government in its legislation, so they are favourable to the government about this legislation. But they identified a cost to their industry of $2.5 billion if the legislation were to go ahead in its present form. That $2.5 billion is not a trifling amount, I would submit; $2.5 billion is a rather large figure. In their view, the legislation would impose that cost on them if the government did not heed the transitional arrangements that were necessary to protect the insurance industry from that sort of cost.</para><para>They said that in their view it was not intended by the government that this level of cost be imposed and that they had argued to the government that level of cost should be removed. At the point of giving evidence and since—because they are under an obligation to notify us if the facts change—the government had not notified them as to whether it would accept their view. If the $2.5 billion had to be met by the insurance industry, would they meet it by rifling their profit and taking it out of that? Would they meet it by cutting down their costs and sacking workers? Would they meet it by passing on that cost to their policy holders or their consumers? Would they meet it by any one of the combination of all of the above? We asked them that question. They said that they would meet it by passing on the costs to their policy holders. That is to say, those people who have insurance in Australia would face an extra cost because of the transitional costs of this legislation to that industry—$2.5 billion all up.</para><para>The government has made much of what I think is a quite fraudulent argument, and this is a way of demonstrating how fraudulent it is. The government has campaigned up and down this country, saying, `These are the tax cuts that we offer Australians and, if you vote 
 for our package, you will get these tax cuts.' They have quoted the flamboyant figures set out in their ANTS report—as part of the tables for families ranging from single income earners on low incomes up to families on high incomes with multiple dependants—and they have identified what people at each level would get. Of course the government propaganda concentrates on what middle Australia would get, because middle Australia is the voting population that has been targeted for the government as the swing vote in this issue.</para><para>What the government keeps quoting to Australians on the package of tax cuts is the gross figure of tax cuts; that is, the figure that they will pay you if they pass their legislation. But I emphasise the word `gross'. Everyone in Australia knows the difference between gross income and net income—income before tax and after tax. When you start going around and looking at the submissions we have received, time after time industry groups which support the government's intentions have raised objections to the way in which they are done, transitional difficulties, difficulties about compliance or difficulties about special areas of their industry that have pointed to extra costs—and one of the biggest areas where that has arisen has been in local government.</para><para>Every time extra costs have been pointed to, government members of our committee have said that in the case of those extra costs there is the compensation package and there are the tax cuts, and very soon you begin to realise that the gross figures—proselytised around this country as what people would get if this package went through—get degraded at every turn with extra hidden costs.</para><para>I have not done the sums yet but I promise this chamber I will before the debate comes on. But the overwhelming impression one now gains, given what else we have not been told about what the package will have to meet, is that the tax cuts at gross level, when reduced by the amount of extra and hidden costs that will have to be paid, are nowhere near substantial and are probably in most 
 cases in the negative for most Australians. In other words, give with one hand, take with the other; the net outcome—what is the real gain—is  in fact a real loss.</para><para>As I said, I have not done the sums but I promise the chamber I will do them before we get to the debate on this. But I stand by my remarks that, as for the overwhelming impression—taking the business, local government and other objections raised to this package on the basis that they have been given to us—that is the outcome. So next time any Australian hears from a government spokesperson what is the value of the tax cuts, remember: that is what they are giving you up-front, but what they are taking away behind the scenes is another thing entirely and you will probably end up in the negative.</para><para>The worst example of this blatant misrepresentation occurred last month when on the front page of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> newspaper there was a photograph of Senator Harradine and Senator Margetts with the newspaper saying, `These people are denying you these tax cuts.'

BASI is conducting an analysis of the factual information 
 in order to determine the significant factors relevant to the occurrence. The analysis will consider immediate and systemic factors that BASI regards as being relevant. BASI's policy does not provide for the use of the term `cause' in its conclusions. The initial analysis of the radar data indicated that the British Aerospace Jetstream 31 and the Beechcraft Super King Air B200 passed each other with 0.54NM horizontal separation and 600ft vertical separation.

The service is not intended to relieve the pilot of the responsibility for continual vigilance to see and avoid other aircraft. Provision of the service is not optional on the part of ATC, but must be provided as workload permits. Many factors, such as limitations of radar, volume of traffic, controller workload and communication frequency congestion could prevent ATC from providing this service. Controllers possess complete discretion for determining whether they are able to provide RIS in a specific case. Prior to providing a radar information service, ATC must identify the aircraft and notify the pilot that the aircraft has been identified.</para><para>(10) Prior to the incident occurring, the air traffic controller was providing radar services to the crew of the Beechcraft Super King Air. In providing radar services within controlled airspace the air traffic controller has no responsibility to initiate avoiding action in respect of unknown aircraft which can be reasonably be assumed to be outside controlled airspace.</para><para>Nevertheless, if in the judgement of the radar controller, the action of an observed radar return or information received from other sources gives good reason to believe the observed radar return of an unknown aircraft is likely to be a hazard to an aircraft under control, the controller has complete discretion to take such action as considered necessary to maintain the safety of the aircraft under radar control. This may comprise the provision of traffic information, controller initiated traffic avoidance advice or a safety alert.</para><para>The air traffic controller attempted to pass traffic information to the pilot of the Beechcraft Super King Air. However, the crew did not hear that transmission. The controller later attempted to apply a vertical separation standard between the British Aerospace Jetstream 31 and the Beechcraft Super King Air B200.

The Commission's advice was made in the context of assurances provided by Dr Drielsma, Forestry Tasmania to Dr Dickson, Environment Australia in correspondence of the 10 October 1997. The correspondence indicated that Forestry Tasmania has implemented its planning processes including the interrogation of databases developed as part of the joint CRA process. This includes data on indicative national estate values and rare and threatened species. Dr Drielsma also indicated that the regional protection of any national estate values or rare and threatened species identified from the interrogation of the database will be achieved through a combination of reservation and through the incorporation of management prescriptions into the relevant timber harvesting plans. In the case of proposed coupes identified as containing one or more of the following indicative national estate values: key fauna habitat for rare and threatened species, fauna values relating to past processes and diversity, flora values relating to past processes and diversity, wetlands, natural history sites, geoheritage values or cultural values, the Commission noted that it understands that the indicative national estate values will be protected at the regional level through reservation and through management prescriptions incorporated in the relevant timber harvesting plans. On this basis, the Commission advised that timber harvesting may have a local adverse impact on national estate values, but these values will remain protected at the regional level. In the caseosed  ofop pr proposed coupes identified as containing old growth forest, extensive natural values, or principal characteristics of forest vegetation values, the Commission advised that timber harvesting may have a local adverse impact on these values within the coupes. However, the Commission noted that it anticipates that these values will be adequately protected at the regional level in a CAR Reserve System, to be implemented under the terms of the RFA. Where the proposed coupes were not identified as containing any indicative national estate values, the Commission advised that timber harvesting would not impact on any known national estate forest value.

One proposed coupe (ME015B) was located within the boundaries of the proposed CAR Reserve System (Sumac Road Reserve). The coupe was identified as containing key fauna habitat values. The Commission advised that it was highly likely that forest operations, including timber harvesting and roading, would have an adverse impact on national estate forest values within the coupe, and may compromise the regional protection of key fauna habitat for rare and threatened species within the CAR Reserve System. Accordingly, the Commission advised against approving forest operations at this coupe. Another of the proposed coupes (TI005G) was identified as containing Eucalyptus regnans old growth forest. The Commission noted its concern that Eucalyptus regnans old growth forest was not adequately represented within the proposed CAR Reserve System, and pointed out that it had raised this as an issue with the Minister. The Commission advised against timber harvesting prior to conclusion of the RFA.

The proposal includes 8 coupes located within, and 19 coupes adjacent (within 500 metres of) to National Estate Places. The proposed coupes have been forwarded to the Commonwealth for consideration within the context of an extension to the Victorian Interim Forest Agreement (IFA, 1996). The original IFA gives undertakings not to foreclose options for a CAR reserve system. The same undertakings will be made with respect to the extension of the IFA. On the basis of the information provided by NRE and the undertakings in the existing IFA, the proposed coupes in this referral will not foreclose options for a CAR reserve system. Six proposed coupes occur within `The Grampians National Estate Place' in the West RFA Region. Proposed timber harvesting operations in these coupes will be of low intensity involving the extraction of minor forest produce and small amounts of sawlog through single tree selection. Harvesting will occur in accordance with the Victorian Code of Forest Practices for Timber Production and is considered unlikely to have a significant impact on the area's identified values. Two proposed coupes occur within the `Mullundung Forest National Estate Place' in the Gippsland RFA Region. One of these coupes (449/514/05) has previously been approved for timber harvesting following Commission advice of September 1997. The Commission advised that while harvesting may have a local adverse impact, it would not be significant at a regional level and that the protection of rare and endangered species would be addressed through the Wood Utilisation Plan. The other coupe (449/515/01) is a thinning operation and will not cause significant impacts at a regional level. For proposed coupes adjacent to national estate places, timber harvesting is unlikely to impact on the national estate values as the coupes are either downstream of the National Estate Places, located within a different watershed, or contain values that will be protected through agreed management prescriptions.  </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>2900

 Despoja asked me a question without notice concerning:</para></talk.start><para>The establishment of codes of conduct and implementation of standards for alternative dispute resolution processes for the financial services sector.</para><para>The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</para><para>A number of codes of conduct and alternative dispute resolution schemes (ADRs) are currently in operation across the financial system. These include the Banking Code of Practice, the Life Insurance Code, the General Insurance Code and the General Insurance Brokers Code of Practice. The financial sector codes range in content from general statements of principle about how the financial services industry operates, to listing specific industry practices which are guaranteed. The various ADRs often operate in conjunction with the relevant industry code of practice. The most notable general feature of the existing codes and ADRs is that they are developed and conducted by industry bodies.</para><para>The independent development and operation of these codes and ADRs broadly reflects the historical development of the wider financial system. This development was characterised by the emergence of separate financial institutions, regulatory structures and supporting legislation based on what were traditionally discrete industry sectors. The various codes of practice and ADRs arose largely independently of each other and in a form considered to be appropriate to serve the needs of consumers in these formerly discrete industry sectors.</para><para>As a consequence of the development and operation of codes and ADRs by industry bodies, the role for government in their day-to-day operation and development has been limited. The Commonwealth does, however, have a formal role of nominating consumer representatives to some ADRs and it also provides the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The Constitutional basis for the Tribunal's review and determination function is currently uncertain following a full Federal Court decision that the Tribunal was invalidly purporting to exercise judicial power when performing this function.</para><para>The Government has nevertheless over recent years sought to improve the operation of codes and ADRs. In relation to ADRs, the former Minister for Consumer Affairs released <inline font-style="italic">Benchmarks for Industry-Based Customer Dispute Resolution Schemes</inline>  in August 1997. This publication identified best practice including from existing schemes, to provide a guide to industry in making improvements in their ADRs. This followed the release in 
 1995 of an Australian Standard (AS 4269-1995) on complaint handling.</para><para>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has also promoted the adoption of best practice standards in the financial services sector. In its 1995 <inline font-style="italic">Good Advice</inline>  Report on the provision of financial services advice, ASIC made a number of recommendations encouraging development of such best practice standards by industry groups. One of these recommendations accepted by the Government was that securities dealers and advisers licensed under the Corporations Law be required to maintain internal complaint handling arrangements. The Government has moved to require that such licensees must also be members of an external complaints resolution scheme approved by ASIC. Both these requirements were implemented from 1 October 1998. ASIC has also required that, consistent with the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Managed Investments Act 1998</inline> , members of registered managed investment schemes have access to an external complaints resolution scheme from 1 July 1999.</para><para>The enactment of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 1998</inline>  provided additional powers for ASIC with respect to the various codes of practice and ADRs currently operating in the financial system. Since 1 July 1998, ASIC has the function of "monitoring and promoting market integrity and consumer protection in the Australian financial system in relation to the provision of financial services". ASIC also has the specific functions of "promoting the adoption of, and approving and monitoring compliance with, industry standards and codes of practice (including standards and codes in relation to the resolution of disputes between the providers of financial services and consumers)". These functions are provided under section 12FA of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.</inline></para><para>Pursuant to its new consumer protection role, ASIC is monitoring the operation and compliance with the various codes and ADRs within the financial system. It is working with the Reserve Bank on a review of compliance with the Code of Banking Practice and is preparing to undertake similar </para><para></para><para>monitoring of the codes governing building societies and credit unions. In this regard while the Commonwealth has responsibility for prudential supervision and consumer protection for financial services (with the exception of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code for which the States and Territories are responsible), at present, the States and Territories are responsible for the supervision of non-bank financial institutions, such as credit unions, building societies and friendly societies. The Commonwealth is expected to acquire responsibility in these areas in 1999 subject to the States and Territory agreement and passage of enabling legislation. From that time ASIC would be in a position to extend its monitoring and other roles under the ASIC Act to these non-bank financial institutions.</para><para>ASIC has also undertaken a range of activities to promote alternative dispute resolution procedures. These include chairing the Roundtable of Complaints Schemes, which provides a forum for the promotion and support of complaints schemes. In 1998 ASIC also established the Financial Complaints Referral Centre (FCRC), which assists consumers by directing them to the appropriate complaints scheme for their situation. It also collects statistics to assist ASIC in identifying where schemes need to be improved or expanded. The FCRC trial has been extended a further year to February 2000.</para><para>ASIC also released an Interim Policy Statement (IPS 139) in August 1998 on <inline font-style="italic">Approval of External Complaints Resolution Schemes</inline> . The IPS indicates how ASIC intends to interpret and apply section 12FA(2), and identified key issues requiring further consultation prior to settling a final approval policy. On 3 February 1999 ASIC released a Policy Proposal Paper, refining the proposed approach to approval of external complaints handling schemes. ASIC has sought public comment by 5 March 1999 on the key issues raised in the Policy Proposal Paper and will finalise its policy in light of these public submissions.</para><para>The Government will shortly release a consultation paper which will among other things consider the appropriate role for codes of practice in the financial services industry.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
