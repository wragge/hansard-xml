ATSIC began operations on 5 March 1990. ATSIC gives indigenous people a voice in the processes of government.</para><para>Its representative arm consists of 35 Regional Councils on the mainland and Tasmania, and the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Every three years, indigenous people vote in Regional Council elec 
 tions. Their elected representatives consult with local indigenous communities about programs and policies affecting them, and represent their interests to the ATSIC Board.</para><para>ATSIC Regions are incorporated into zones. There are 16 zones, and the Regional Councillors in each zone elect one of their number to be on the ATSIC Board—their zone Commissioner. There is also a zone Commissioner from the Torres Strait, elected by members of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. To date, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has also appointed the Chairperson, and one other Commissioner. This provision in the ATSIC Act was amended in 1996, to provide that the Commission consisted of only elected representatives, and that the ATSIC Chairperson be elected by the Commissioners from amongst their number. This amendment to the act will apply after the forthcoming ATSIC zone elections which will follow the ATSIC Regional Council elections scheduled for 9 October 1999. It is expected that the elections of zone Commissioners will take place in early December 1999.</para><para>Madame President, I pay tribute here to the achievements of the founding Chairperson, Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue, and the current Chair, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura. Both are widely respected and admired for their significant contributions to indigenous affairs in Australia.</para><para>The bill before the Senate today does not include any major changes to the ATSIC Act, but it is important in that it clarifies the process pertaining to the new arrangements for the Chairperson. The bill provides that the person elected by his or her fellow Commissioners to be the ATSIC Chair ceases to hold his or her original offices of Regional Councillor and zone Commissioner. The positions left vacant by the election of the Chairperson will be filled through the processes set down in the election rules made under the ATSIC Act. The indigenous people in the affected region do not have to vote again—a recount is done to elect the new Councillor. In the case of the vacant position of zone Commissioner the Regional Councillors will elect a new Commissioner in a by election. This process results in a Commission of 18 members, rather than the 19 currently.</para><para>To ensure that the number of Commissioners should equal the number of zones, plus one (the Chairperson), the bill also provides that a Chairperson who resigns is also taken to have resigned as a Commissioner. The bill removes the current reference to 17 members in section 27 of the act and clarifies that the Minister must appoint as members of the Commission those persons elected to represent the several zones.</para><para>The bill will commence when Commissioners take office after the zone elections in approximately December 1999. 
</para><para>There are no financial implications arising from this bill except that the person who fills the vacant offices of Commissioner and Regional Councillor will be entitled to salary and allowances.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till the first day of the 1999 summer sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7222</page.no><id.no>s841</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>7222</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 10 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>7222</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday I addressed the Senate in reply  to the second reading debate on the bill before the chamber, the <inline ref="s841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999</inline> , and I would like to clarify for senators the fact that we do not have the <inline ref="r839">Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999</inline>  before the chamber. We are debating the bill which will in effect deal with the referendum on 6 November, and without the passage of that bill the referendum cannot take place. Consequential to any move to a republic is the passage of the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, which I have mentioned. I note that Senator Brown has moved amendments to the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill, but that bill is not before us at this time.</para></talk.start><para>I can say, however, that the government has considered its response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, and in that report there were recommendations in relation to the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999. The government proposes tabling its response, which sets out the government's attitude to those recommendations of the joint committee which deal with the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  and with the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999. We are covering two pieces of proposed legislation—one which is before the Senate and one which is not—but we want to 
 be able to tell the Senate and the community what we as a government will do in the event that we move to a republic on 6 November this year.</para><para>During the course of the committee stage in the debate of this bill it would be useful if we canvassed the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill as well. This is not an usual procedure, but we are dealing with something that is quite extraordinary—namely, a referendum dealing with whether this country should become a republic. There is nothing untoward about this; it is simply a matter of procedure and a matter I wanted to draw to the attention of senators. At the conclusion of my reply I will seek to table the government's response.</para><para>As well as that, I draw to the attention of senators the fact that the research which I mentioned in my speech last night was tabled. That was made public previously, but nevertheless it was thought appropriate to table it yesterday so that anyone who did not have a copy of it could obtain one for the purposes of the ensuing debate.</para><para>The government has amendments which I believe have now been circulated in the chamber. These amendments relate to the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , which is the bill before us.</para><para>I conclude by once again thanking senators for their contributions yesterday and stressing to the Senate that the government is approaching this in an open-handed and objective manner and that it intends to engage in a full campaign to educate the community in relation to aspects of our current system, the proposed changes and the procedure of the referendum. We are taking on board the comments made in relation to informing the public. We realise from our research that there is some work to be done—approximately half those people surveyed said that they needed more information. More particularly we will be looking at those sectors of the community with a non-English speaking background, particularly Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I conclude with those remarks, and I table the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>7223</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7223</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Chair, before we commence the committee stage debate, can I ask for the cooperation of the committee in relation to the general issue of the handling of the committee stage debate. It goes to the issue of when we might deal with the question of the long title of the bill. You might seek advice on this, but I certainly understand that the issue of the long title may well in the ordinary course of events be dealt with at the conclusion of the committee stage of the debate. Given that the Senate standing orders are clear on that point, the point I would like to make to the committee in a general sense before we commence the committee stage debate is that we do have a circumstance here where the long title actually informs the debate. I think from all sides of the chamber and all sides of the argument there would be general agreement about that. It does seem to me in this instance that we might look, either with leave of the committee or with cooperation of those participating in the committee stage debate, that on this occasion, in the interests of facilitating the debate, we deal with the question of the long title first. I do not want to place that procedural conundrum before you so early in the day—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—I have an answer, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

 Faulkner has just outlined, Chair. I think it is sensible. As Senator Faulkner says, the long title does inform the debate. It is central to the debate that is going to ensue. I am trying to just work this out. It is a matter of really determining at the outset what the question will be at referendum in so far as this committee is concerned and then we get on to debating the rest. The long title of the bill is in effect the sentence that will be put on the referendum papers, so it is very important that we clear that up first. Senator Faulkner is quite sensibly saying that we should do that instead of as normal at the end as a very last question in the committee deliberations, which could be sometime tonight or tomorrow. It is much better that we know what we are dealing with right now at the outset. I think it is a sensible move and I will certainly be granting leave, if that is what is required.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>7223</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take the view that the long title should be dealt with in accordance with what is in the standing orders. It is there for a very valid reason in the standing orders. I have seen amendments to legislation go through the committee stage which really do have an effect on those of us who are considering the long title at the end of the legislation. To deal with the long title at this point in time is, in my view, premature. There is quite a large number of amendments which we need to be considering and I do not think it is appropriate or practical, to be quite frank, to deal with the long title right now. I would suggest that it would be better to deal with the long title, if it is inadequate, having regard to amendments that are made to the legislation. Let us do it at the appropriate time, informed as we will be of what the general desire of the chamber is.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7223</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is slightly at a tangent but I think still relevant to the order we deal with the amendments in.

I understand that it has been put forward with the best of reasons. However, I think it is best to stick with the standing orders and deal with the long title last. There will be a debate on the bill and there may or may not be amendments during the course of that debate and I think it is appropriate at the conclusion of the debate to then look back at the bill that you have and consider the long title. I think that is why we deal with the long title at the conclusion of the debate: so that senators know what we are dealing with. It is somewhat like putting the cart before the horse. Therefore, I would put to the chamber that the government is not minded to support that proposition.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7224</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are unique circumstances here and I do think, in relation to this particular bill, that the long title does inform the debate, as I have indicated.

I appreciate that the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens believe that this would be 
 a sensible way of proceeding but I acknowledge that Senator Harradine has some concerns and that Senator Ellison, who is handling the bill for the government, is very lukewarm about the proposition.</para></talk.start><para>On that basis I do not intend to press the issue and I am sure that senators will have a mind to the substantive issue as we deal with it in the committee stage of debate.

However, also at the outset can I say that we do not intend to embark upon a long, protracted debate. Others might do so in the chamber this morning but we do not intend to embark on a long, protracted debate in respect of these issues. For us the core issue is the question that is to be put to the public.</para><para> In respect of this, recommendations 8 and 9 of the report are essentially the source of motivation for the opposition to move this particular amendment. This amendment provides that, subject to the Constitution, the constitutional conventions concerning the appropriate sources of advice for the Governor-General in respect of the exercise of the reserve powers applying immediately before the office of Governor-General ceased to exist shall apply in respect of the President. In essence, this amendment seeks to do a bit of housekeeping to ensure that the sources of advice continue to be the same for the President as they would otherwise have been for the Governor-General.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>7225</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, for the reasons outlined by Senator Bolkus, the Australian Democrats think this is a logical and appropriate amendment.

That amendment refers to page 3 of the bill, section 59, Executive power. The amendment says that `the exercise and extent of a reserve power shall not be subject to review by any court or tribunal'. The reserve powers of a President together with the conventions guiding their exercise are placed in the Constitution in the proposed section 59. By this fact, these powers could become justiciable. This could have the practical effect of dragging the High Court into a political controversy to review whether an act of a President was constitutional. This would be unprecedented in our constitutional history, and could cause delays and hinder the proper use of the reserve powers.</para></talk.start><para>While the crisis of 1975 was undeniably tumultuous, it was resolved in the political arena. The High Court was already stained, in my opinion, by the involvement of Barwick CJ in the controversy, but it would have 
 incurred much more damage had the High Court been placed in the position of reviewing Governor-General Kerr's actions. In my opinion, the role of the High Court must be, so far as is possible, to be a separate independent arbiter on the proper construction of constitutional provisions. Involvement in political crises could seriously impair its capacity and authority to perform this function. It is my view that it is not a body well placed or equipped to perform that role. Having said that, it is imperative that the reserve powers of the Governor-General are carried over to the President, along with the conventions that guide their exercise. That is why I have just voted with the opposition on their amendment. I submit that the proposed section 59 paragraph 3 should contain the explicit direction that the reserve powers and conventions mentioned in the paragraph are not to be subject to review in any court. It is my belief and understanding that that is the present situation and I think it is desirable that it continue. I accordingly move amendment No. 2:</para><para>(2)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (after line 25), at the end of section 59, add:</para><para>	 The exercise and extent of a reserve power shall not be subject to review by any court or tribunal.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7226</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is the opposition's view that the government has an amendment which covers this precise point of justiciability.

That of course was not the problem in 1975. The problem there was—and Senator Murray mentioned it—about the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick. It was what he did before the dismissal that was of concern. It was the giving of advice to the Governor-General as Chief Justice that led to the concern and distress at that time. Listening to Senator Murray it seemed to me that this provision does not overcome the problem that led to the tumult at that time. I understand that what he is saying is that the decision of the Governor-General or the President to exercise a reserve power should not be subject to the High Court, but that is not the issue that was a problem in 1975; the issue in 1975 was the discussion between the Governor-General at that time and the Chief Justice about matters which, I would say, propriety should not have allowed.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>7227</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not support Senator Murray's amendment.

We believe it is in accordance with the recommendations of the joint committee. The status quo is the reserve powers, and the conventions which govern their exercise are high political matters which are not subject to review by a court. That view has been questioned from time to time. In the approach to this, the government has thought it best to follow the recommendation of the joint committee in leaving things as they are, but it still keeps faith with the convention model. It rules out any argument 
 that any reserve powers or conventions are lost in the transition to a republic. It preserves the status quo whilst accommodating any change.

I cannot see much point in having a committee that puts forward a list of potential presidents to the Prime Minister for the Prime Minister then to select somebody entirely different.</para><para>There is, as we know, a lot of concern amongst the Australian electorate that there is not going to be, under the formula presented by this bill, opportunity for direct election of the President by the people of Australia. What came out of the Constitutional Convention is the alternative means of input for the selection of a President: any Australian can put forward the name of a person or persons who they believe would make a good President to a committee set up to vet those nominations, to narrow the field and to put forward a short list to the Prime Minister, who then makes a selection. If that is approved by the Leader of the Opposition, the vital steps have been made towards the selection of a new President.</para><para>Under this legislation, however, the Prime Minister can get around that. The Prime Minister can look at the short list which has come through that public nomination process and select somebody entirely different. On Channel 9 the night before last Prime Minister Howard pointed to this very shortcoming as another reason for people voting no at the coming referendum. This Greens amendment gets around the Prime Minister's ability to 
 argue that that nomination process is a farce. It tightens it up. It ensures that the Prime Minister is limited to the list put forward by the Presidential Nominations Committee.</para><para>The committee will be aware that I have an amendment which I will move later to also make that nominations committee balanced in its representation of the Australian people. It will, amongst other things, mean that the Prime Minister, who nominates the committee, will have to take into account states and territories of origin of people going on the committee, sex, age, cultural diversity and the desirability of indigenous representation.</para><para>This is a minimal alternative to the direct election process. It is very important that we tighten this up, that we make that Presidential Nominations Committee a real representation of the Australian people, that we make its work valid and that we do not leave open to the cupidity of a future Prime Minister the ability to treat it with disdain and go outside the nominated list put forward and select somebody else. That has the potential of course for a Prime Minister to ensure that, in the future, he or she chooses a President who comes from their own political party or their own persuasion or who is seen as a safe bet rather than somebody who has come through the public nomination process.</para><para>They are very important amendments, simple as they may be. Amendment No. 1 substitutes the word `may' for `must'. It says that the Prime Minister must take a nominee from the list put forward by his or her own Presidential Nominations Committee. It is a very simple and important amendment. I recommend the amendments to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7228</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the two Green amendments before us for many of the reasons outlined by Senator Brown. We think it is quite an appropriate amendment to place an onus on the Prime Minister that he will act in accordance with the wishes and the recommendations of the nomination committee. The Australian Democrats appreciate that there are some already existing safeguards and provisions in the legislation which ensure that the 
 Prime Minister has regard to the committee's recommendations, but we do not believe there are enough safeguards to ensure that the Prime Minister of the day does not simply ignore or override the will of that committee.</para></talk.start><para>The nomination process was a key, I believe, to the success of this particular model in the final stages of the Constitutional Convention last year. An important ingredient of that was allowing for public input into that nomination process and ensuring that the public input was appropriately diverse and reasonably representative. That is an issue that we discussed in the joint select committee process. I am glad to see that the second recommendation of that committee was accepted. It states:</para><para>. . . Nominations Committee Bill be amended to require the Prime Minister to, as far as practicable, have regard to the diversity of the Australian people when appointing community members of the Nominations Committee.</para><para>All these factors are very important. We should have some sense of certainty in relation to the Prime Minister's actions. The previous speaker referred to some rather glib comments by the Prime Minister in a Channel 9 interview a couple of nights ago that concerned me. There is a need to ensure diversity is taken into account and that the will of the people on that committee is not overruled and ignored. Certainly, this is one way of doing that and the Democrats support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>7228</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate at this stage that the opposition does not support these two amendments.

The word `must' is probably inappropriate when it comes to the necessity for an agreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the

In respect of the first part of the amendment—`must move for a President to be appointed'—we have a view that the reality is that that will happen once the system is set up, so there is no need to have the obligation that is implied in the word `must'.

The question is who is to be made responsible for the appointment of the President.</para></talk.start><para>Under this provision, the Prime Minister can put forward a name to the parliament, but the motion requires seconding by the Leader of the Opposition and affirming by a two-thirds majority.

I am not going to support a situation which is farcical whereby a committee is established to which the Australian people put in nominations and then the Prime Minister can gazump it, ignore it. In response to Senator Harradine, the Prime Minister is going to nominate this committee, hopefully with reference to the diversity of Australians. The Prime Minister is responsible for the committee. There is no getting away from that. If the committee does not give the right choices to the Prime Minister then it is on his or her head.</para></talk.start><para>We already have in this legislation the situation where that committee is appointed and the Prime Minister is responsible for it. If the Prime Minister makes a hash of establishing that committee then of course the people can judge that at the ballot-box. But this committee has been established as a means—it is a very vital component—of offsetting the disappointment many Australians are expressing that this legislation does not enable the direct election of a President, because so many Australians want to be able to vote for a President each time that vacancy occurs. What I am saying here is that the Constitutional Convention said, `Well, the best way we can assuage that wish by Australians under the system that has been devised is that there be a committee set up, that that committee be appointed by the Prime Minister but it then consider the nominations coming from Australians as to who should be President.' That is all. That is where the Australian people get their input.</para><para>The committee and the Labor Party here, along with Senator Harradine and the government, are saying, `Well, yes, we have the committee set up. The nominations all go in, but then the Prime Minister can ignore that.' We are just simply giving more power to the executive office, to the Prime Minister. I do 
 not think that is what we are about in this place. I think those parties who are saying no to this amendment should think again. Maybe the Labor Party sees itself back in office at some future time and it wants its Prime Minister to have this power. Of course that is going to happen, but it is not giving the Australian people the dinkum opportunity, minimal as this process might be, to feed in their nomination for President and expect that nomination to be treated with the respect it deserves.</para><para>If the Prime Minister can get round that nomination process then you are devaluing it. Its value is limited as it is, and I think to devalue it further by opposing these two amendments is the wrong way to go. I certainly want a division on this, but it may be that I am not even going to get support for that. Let that be on the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>7230</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to deal with these amendments in two parts. The first substitutes `must' for `may'. One of the weaknesses of the bill and the proposals is that it is possible that there may exist an indeterminate period when an Acting President is in place. It is improper, in my view, for that situation not to be resolved. What the first change would do, without taking responsibility away from the Prime Minister to make the decision, which is the present intention of this bill, would be to require him to make that decision or require her to make that decision—and may it soon be a her as well—as a result of the committee meeting and making some recommendations to him. So I think the change from `may' to `must' is a useful improvement on the bill.</para></talk.start><para>However, I find the second amendment difficult to support because that just says `recommended by that committee' and, as we all know, this is at least a two-part process—it is probably a three-part process: firstly, the public are invited to provide nominations; secondly, the committee meets and comes to a conclusion; and, thirdly, the Prime Minister of the day is required to consult, as the bill says, with the Leader of the Opposition. As we will discuss later, I am of the opinion that consultation should be with the heads of 
 political parties within the parliament. If at some day in the future the coalition dissolves back into two constituent parties, I think it would be utterly improper for the Leader of the National Party not to be consulted and I certainly think it is improper for the Leader of the Australian Democrats not to be consulted. So the stricture that it is confined to the decisions recommended by that committee is in contradiction to the bill's intent, to the model's intent, and is a restraint.

We should not make this selection committee process and the input of the Australian people a farce, if the Prime Minister seeks to go outside it.

They are two processes: to receive the committee's recommendation and to consult with the Leader of the Opposition.

In fact, we would agree with Senator Cooney's assertion that this heightens the aspect of justiciability. It is something which Senator Harradine was concerned with. It imposes a more cast-iron obligation on the Prime Minister and, of course, that is the intention that the Greens have here. But the more you do that, the more you open it up to judicial review, and that is something which the government thinks is problematic.</para></talk.start><para>In any event, there is a clear expectation that the President will be appointed at the end of an incumbent's term. This has operated for many years in this country with the way that governors-general are appointed by the Prime Minister. The practice has been observed, and the government believes it will continue to be observed because there will be political 
 pressures to do so. The convention provided for an Acting President in circumstances where there might be a gap between appointments. I put to the Senate that the convention was not of a mind to say that there should be an automatic requirement—the insertion of a `must', if you like—in relation to the Prime Minister's actions. It saw that the current system was sufficient and that there would be sufficient pressure to appoint a successor to the incumbent. Therefore, the government is of a view that it would be inappropriate to require the Prime Minister in the circumstances mentioned.</para><para>The government's proposal allows for the opportunity for the Prime Minister to engage with the Leader of the Opposition to nominate a presidential candidate. You do not know what might transpire in the affairs of human beings. You might have someone who is on the way to being nominated who passes away or for some other reason is ineligible, and it is then back to the drawing board. Meanwhile, you would have this sanction of `must' hanging over the Prime Minister. It is the view of the government that, in the circumstances, there are adequate safeguards that carry on the current practice and that are not contrary to the convention model.</para><para>As for the second amendment, the government is saying that the proposal is in accordance with the convention recommendations. The Prime Minister is technically under no obligation to nominate someone from the short list. However, again, there would be immense political pressure to do so. The requirement of a sanction again opens this up to judicial review and again does not accommodate something which might transpire, such as someone becoming ineligible to be moved forward. For that reason, the government is of the view that this should not be changed. The convention said that, having taken into account the report of the committee, the Prime Minister would put forward a single nomination. The convention did not say that it must be from the short list, although it was intended that there be political pressure that it be from the short list—and, in most cases, it would invariably be from the short list. Nonetheless the convention proceeded on the 
 basis that the Prime Minister would not be bound to move a name which was from the short list, much for the reasons I have pointed out.</para><para>There is another aspect mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja in relation to recommendation 3 of the joint committee which provided that:</para><para>. . . where the Prime Minister nominates as President a person other than a candidate mentioned in the short list . . . the Prime Minister be required to table a statement in Parliament giving his or her reasons for deciding that such exceptional circumstances existed for failing to comply with the Nomination Committee's recommendations.</para><para>The government's response is in the document I tabled earlier. In substance, that recommendation is supported. Under section 60 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister is technically under no obligation to limit his or her nomination to a person from the short list provided by a nominations committee in its report. The Constitutional Convention's resolution is expressed in terms that the Prime Minister is to `take into account' the committee's report. It is clear that debate at the convention proceeded on the basis that the Prime Minister should not be under obligation to appoint a person identified by the nominations committee, although it was rightly recognised that the political realities would impose pressures to do so. I outlined that earlier.</para><para>It is possible to identify circumstances in which it may not be appropriate to nominate a person recommended by a nominations committee. An example is where agreement could not be reached with the Leader of the Opposition on any of the committee's short list. In any nominations procedure, the Prime Minister has to obtain the backing of the Leader of the Opposition. Another example is where an outstanding candidate excluded from the committee's consideration because of an apparent unavailability subsequently agreed to be considered when approached by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition. It may well be that the nominations committee looked at a pool of candidates but excluded an outstanding candidate who was thought at the time to be unavailable, that that then changed and that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both then thought 
 this person should be approached. That would rule out an allowance for that to be accommodated.</para><para>The government would not accept any proposal to amend proposed section 60 of the Constitution to fetter the Prime Minister's constitutional discretion. However, the government supports amendments of the nominations committee bill to provide explicitly for a Prime Minister who moves a name that is not on the nominations committee short list to inform the parliament of reasons for the alternative nomination. The government would undertake to move an amendment in those terms accordingly when or if the need arose to consider the nominations committee bill. The government is saying that it would agree to the Prime Minister having to table reasons as to the choice of this alternative candidate. It would not be a situation where the Prime Minister would have to give reasons for deciding that such exceptional circumstances existed for failing to comply with the nominations committee recommendations—a subtle difference but nonetheless one which we believe is more preferable. It would perhaps avoid the odium of comparison.</para><para>In the situation recommended by the joint committee, you would invite a situation where the Prime Minister might say, `These weren't as good as the one I am looking at,' or, `There was some problem with these candidates.' We are saying that, if the Prime Minister does choose an outsider—to term it that way—the Prime Minister would give reasons saying why that person was such an outstanding candidate. For those reasons, we believe there should be a subtle difference in the way we support recommendation 3 of the joint committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7233</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister, but I am totally unconvinced.

 We are in an age where the executive is accreting more and more power to itself. I do not want to be part of that process. It may suit the big parties to be, but I think the model we have here is not the favoured model of the Australian people. Australians want to be part of the process of nominating a President. They do not want a Prime Minister, even if recently elected by them, to be able to gazump that process or to get around it. We should be making that clear here. I can see I do not have the numbers, but I reiterate that these amendments are about power to the people.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—The question is that Greens amendment No. 1 be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:49:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

In moving this motion, I will give a brief resume of my reasons. The proposed section 60 provides that the Leader of the Opposition must second the nomination of the President. That makes the bold assumption that a single formal Leader of the Opposition will continue to exist in Australian federal politics in the long term. Given that our Constitution needs to remain workable during the course of the 21st century and given the knowledge we all have that constitutions are extremely difficult to change, it is desirable that such assumptions be soundly based.</para><para>It is clear from our parliamentary history that the House of Representatives two-party system of today—and even so it is not two-party because, as we know, the coalition is already composed of two—has not always prevailed. The Liberal Party, for example, was formed in 1944 out of the remnants of the United Australia Party and 13 other anti-Labor organisations. A survey of the OECD nations reveals that, out of 29 countries, 23 
 have multiparty oppositions as opposed to formal single-party oppositions. Given the increasing fluidity of contemporary politics, it would be naive to simply assume that the existing Australian party system will not undergo significant changes over the coming century. Therefore, proposed constitutional change should not be so short-sighted as to be founded on a view that the two-party system is here to stay.</para><para>I submit that a provision should be added that the candidate nominated by the Prime Minister have the formal support of the leaders of all recognised federal parliamentary political parties prior to the candidate's name being put to the joint house vote. I know that the constitutional committee has recommended that the words `if any' be added following `the Leader of the Opposition'. But that to me is a poor additional change. It helps, but the real emphasis of the Constitutional Convention model was that some kind of consensual agreement should be reached within the parliament—and I agree with that. I agree that it is desirable and helpful for the Leader of the Opposition to agree with the Prime Minister that the appropriate presidential nomination is the right one for the country; I think that is right. But, if you are going to take `consensus' in its appropriate meaning, you should consult with the leaders of all recognised political parties—with the Leader of the National Party, with the Leader of the Australian Democrats and with the leader of any other political party that is recognised in the parliament.</para><para>The answer may be, `But the nomination has to be approved by a joint sitting anyway,' but that approval process occurs after the consultation. My point simply is to try to ensure that the consultation takes place first. If it is the intention of the Constitutional Convention and if it is the intention of the government and the opposition in supporting the bill that they support a consensual model, why limit it to a notional Leader of the Opposition who might not exist at some future time and not involve a consensual approach to leaders of all political parties that are recognised at the time?</para><para>As an aside, I was interested to see in the formation of the new Israeli government, for instance, the government being composed of something like 11 or 13 parties and the opposition, as such, being composed of another 11 or 13 parties.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Bolkus interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—You come from a long history of factional brawling, Senator Bolkus.

Personally, as you know, I incline towards the latter, but I cannot foresee the future. I am simply suggesting that, if this constitutional change is to be embedded and passed by the people, it should cater for future eventualities better than it does at present and better than the recommendation put by the committee that was reviewing this matter.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>7235</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes Senator Murray's amendment. We see it as not meriting our support for a number of reasons. First of all, it is not within the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention, nor within the ambit of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. Let us understand that those two processes were about reflecting a long process of consultation—the involvement of the public—in the development of a proposal which could be presented to the people and which would have a chance of success in any referendum of the Australian people.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murray, it seems to me that you have been spending too much time with the Prime Minister, because on this and many other amendments today you seem to want to develop as many snags in the proposal going to the public as necessary to ensure that it does not survive the referendum process. Your laughter probably indicates that I may have touched on your motivation here. We see this as a gridlock amendment, basically. We understand why you would put it up. We recognise that any good debate in public 
 would ensure that the public was made aware of the fact that what you are proposing here is a gridlock amendment.</para><para>In terms of the gridlock amendment, our view is that it would be an enormous process to try to get agreement however many parties were in this place at the appropriate time. At the moment we cannot even see agreement within the Democrats on a particular course or direction. If the constitutional process had to wait for the Australian Democrats to come to a consensus about who would or would not be appropriate, it could become quite unbearable.</para><para>Senator Murray, the Israeli model is one that you have proposed to us. As I said to you as an aside, maybe that is the model you want to see for the Australian Democrats, but I do not think we should imperil the constitutional process through the whims of parties which may in fact be minor parties of the day. For us there are sufficient pressures, triggers and constitutional requirements in the model to ensure a consensual approach is taken. The model brings together the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and it brings together the parliament. It requires a two-thirds majority of the parliament. The whole spirit and constitutional structure is one which demands and necessitates a degree of consultation and agreement. We think that spirit will ensure that not only would the Leader of the Opposition be consulted but also the names evolved by the Presidential Nominations Committee would involve an input from every other party and individual in the community and the parliament. We see your amendment as a gridlock amendment and we do not support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7235</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus is in fine form today, but I should acknowledge that this is an amendment around which there is no division or tension. In fact, the Australian Democrats as a whole strongly support the amendment proposed by Senator Murray for the reasons he has so eloquently outlined. Referring to the Constitutional Convention, Senator Bolkus and others would be aware of my attempts, as the Australian Democrat 
 federal delegate at that convention, to incorporate wherever possible maximum consultation with Australian people and politicians and to ensure that all political parties had some formal role in the processes. I was successful with one set of amendments to ensure that the leaders of political parties with more than five representatives in parliament were involved in the Presidential Nominations Committee process. I am glad to see that that amendment was successful. Other attempts, however, to ensure a formal role for leaders of parties other than the two main parties were not successful, but that does not mean that the Democrats have shied away from those attempts to improve this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>We do not think it is particularly difficult to imagine future circumstances where the non-government benches seat a number of opposition parties. We are moving already to an increasing multiparty system in our own parliament, and Senator Murray has referred to what happens in parliaments and governments around the world. This particular amendment not only allows for any future flexibility we might need in our Constitution, but also ensures that the proposal of a candidate by a two-thirds joint sitting of the parliament is a consultative process and, therefore, we think, perhaps a more successful one. The Constitutional Convention sought to ensure that the candidate proposed to the parliament involved a consultative process through many of the ways we have outlined—the nominations process, public input, et cetera. We believe that consultative mechanism is important.</para><para>I am not sure whether the opposition withdrew its amendment which reflected the recommendation of the advisory committee report because they thought that it may be incorporated by the government or that someone else might move it, but I am a bit surprised by that decision. There has been a number of references by government and opposition members today to the recommendations contained in that report, and I think that was a report that grappled with some of these issues—whether there would be an identifiable Leader of the Opposition in the future, and what impact that might have on 
 the success of the nomination and the appointment process; that is, if there were not an ascertainable Leader of the Opposition would the seconding and appointment processes be in some way compromised or undermined.</para><para>Not only with those thoughts in mind—that is, would there be an identifiable Leader of the Opposition—but also I think to ensure that there was that adequate and increased level of consultation, the recommendation that arises out of the committee's report, recommendation No. 4, reads that the republic bill be amended by inserting the words `if any' in proposed section 60 following the words `Leader of the Opposition'. So I think there was a multiparty recognition of the need to include those words.</para><para>I speak on behalf of the Democrats strongly in favour of Senator Murray's amendment. We will be supporting it. We do not see it as an attempt to introduce some kind of gridlock to this process but in fact to expand the process in an inclusive and a consultative way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>7236</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think there are two issues here. There is the nomination and then there is the debate. It is quite clear that, if the nomination has to be affirmed by two-thirds of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, everybody is going to have a say. It is almost going to be like a confirmation hearing, I suppose, which does change things from the way it is done now and goes closer to the American system, where they have confirmation hearings for judges and other officials.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me that, if you are going to have the leader of a party of five or more, then why shouldn't you have people like Senator Brown and Senator Harradine coming in at the initial stage. I would have thought that the idea of having a Prime Minister's nomination seconded by the Leader of the Opposition is a practical one because the government and the opposition are going to have the pull on the floor of the chamber in which these matters are discussed and it is sensible to at least have a fighting position to put to the House of Representatives and the 
 Senate when these matters are being discussed. I am not sure why you should then have everybody who is leader of a party of five or more in that process. It would in effect transfer that process from the debate in the chamber, where everybody can have a go, to a college of electors, as it were, where it would be the leadership of the parties rather than the membership of the parties who are going to have the say.</para><para>What is really being proposed, I think, is that the President be elected by the leaders of the various parties rather than by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate. As it presently reads, people like Senator Brown and Senator Harradine have a big say and can make their voices heard when the debate is taking place as to who should be President. But under the system proposed by Senator Murray, for whom I have got the highest respect, you would have a college of the leaders of the parties electing the President, and I do not think that is what is intended.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>7237</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will briefly respond to that. Senator Cooney, as I read the legislation, at present it is a college of two. In other words, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will fix up the President, go back to their respective caucuses and they have secured the two-thirds. That is with the existing numbers in both houses of parliament at present. All we are suggesting is that it should be widened. Remember that this is a consultation process. The actual voting, of course, is by individuals in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and would include Independents and political parties without recognised status. The reason we have not included consultation with everybody not representing a political party is simply that if that becomes widespread, in other words if you had 30 or 40 Independents, it could be difficult to manage, and the parliament at present does run on the recognised political party model.</para></talk.start><para>I must make it clear that, as you know, I oppose the appointment model, but this is a mechanism which I believe widens the consultation and widens the prospect of the 
 appointed President being less of the potential creature, if you want to express it that way, of one political party. It is not automatic that it would happen that way. I think the Labor Party in its term of office made some extremely useful appointments in the Governor-General role, and we all in this chamber have immense admiration, I think—I certainly have not heard anyone ever express otherwise—for the present Governor-General. So I am not imputing a bad motive automatically based on past practice, but I am indicating that for the future the proposal I put forward adds more to the appointment model than it has at present. Of course, I should qualify all my remarks throughout by making it clear that I oppose the appointment model and I am a supporter of direct election, as you know.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7237</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand what you are saying, Senator Murray, and understand that you are in favour of the model that directly elects the President.

All that has been said is that the best sense, in light of the sort of compromise that can be reached, is that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition make the nomination and then it is up to everybody, including the smaller parties and those who do not belong to a party, to debate whether they are going to accept that nomination.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>7237</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to 
 Senator Cooney—and I acknowledge that he raises the important issue of compromise and what is workable—if one were to ask the question of what really is wrong with the bill as it currently stands, the Democrats would believe that it entrenches the two-party system. It entrenches the notion that only two leaders count in our political system. That may be a theory to which the two old parties in this chamber subscribe but increasingly many Australians have shown in their voting intentions—and in research it is also evident—that Australians are looking forward to the idea that there may be more smaller parties or even Independents; a multiplicity of views in a multiparty system. But this entrenches that, so from a philosophical and a political point of view that is something to which I and my colleagues object.</para></talk.start><para>But also, as Senator Murray has pointed out, who knows what the future holds? It is obviously presumptuous of me to suggest that it does necessarily involve multiparty systems but a lot of the evidence that we are getting—from this country, from the voters, from our constituents and from looking at parliaments across the world—is that indeed that is what the future holds. I think we should be seeking, in updating and modernising our Constitution in this way, not to entrench old systems that entrench two power bases but to look towards more inclusive and consultative mechanisms.</para><para>I do not see this amendment as not feasible or as completely unworkable. I think it is an important caveat that it involves the leaders of parties; that is, people with party status, and you can even include the National Party under this notion. So we are not talking about so many groups as to make it unworkable but about enough groups, and the leaders of those groups, to ensure that the nomination is supported—not seconded, because I note that Senator Murray has used the terminology `as supported'—and to do so in a way that ensures that this nomination is acknowledged and welcomed by all. Perhaps that will set a fine precedent and standard for the way in which the community and other groups respond to this Australian head of state.</para><para>So I would like to see this amendment as part of the process of modernising our Consti 
 tution that we are embarking upon to reflect our changing times including our changing political times—changing times, I hope, that are politically for the better. The Democrats would not be a alone in that. I think we would have strong community support for the notion that this is not about two leaders signing off on a particular nomination; it is about involving other political parties and the representatives that the community has put in the institutions of power here. I commend this amendment.

It would point to the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention and also of the joint committee on this matter. The convention envisaged a proposed procedure where the committee would invite and consider nominations from the public and give a report on the nominations to the Prime Minister. Following consideration of that report by the nominations committee, the Prime Minister would then move, in a joint sitting of the Commonwealth parliament, that a named Australian citizen be chosen as President. The Leader of the Opposition would second the Prime Minister's motion. A two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament would then have to approve the Prime Minister's motion.</para></talk.start><para>We have there a situation where you have community consultation accommodated by the nominations committee, which will be made up of people drawn from the community and members of parliament. Its nomination then goes to the Prime Minister, who seeks the backing of the Leader of the Opposition. Once that is obtained, it goes forth to the joint sitting of both houses of parliament and there it requires a two-thirds majority. So there are a number of hurdles that have to be negotiated during this process and every one of those affords the people of Australia transparency and accountability in the choice of a President for this nation.</para><para>The government believes that if we, at that one point in the sequence, introduced a further hurdle whereby that motion had to be 
 supported by another leader of a political party as described by Senator Murray's amendment, you would have the opening up of a possible gridlock situation, as Senator Bolkus has mentioned. I know that is not what Senator Murray intends. He intends that this amendment accommodate more consultation and that it provide a broader base for the proposal of the motion. But the government believes that the proposal of the motion—being the Prime Minister, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition—is sufficient.</para><para>Perhaps most importantly, this is what the Constitutional Convention envisaged. It is really in accordance with the recommendations made by the joint committee. The joint committee did not say that there should be this aspect, with a further person being sought to support the motion. Senator Cooney's point is a good one because the members of these minor parties and the Independents would be participating in that crucial point of considering the motion. Their views would then be taken on board. For those reasons, the government cannot support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7239</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do support this amendment.

I note that the senator was not here to support my earlier amendment that the nominations committee be empowered in a way that the Prime Minister could not get around. It is difficult, it is early in the piece, but we are discussing very important democratic processes here. As Senator Murray quite rightly pointed out, this is a once-only opportunity. We are talking about the process for a referendum to set constitutional matters which are going to be very difficult to alter further down the line.</para><para>Senator Murray's argument that we have moved into a multiparty period in Australia is backed by the fact that you only have to look at the last election to see that 25 per cent plus of people are voting away from the old parties. Should those people not have a double say in this process? That is, the leaders should get together, put forward a nomination and then two-thirds of the parliament should be required to vote for it further down the line. It is easy to bring up a term like `gridlock', but what about a gridlock between Labor and Liberal? We are not resiling from that potential. In fact, the very reason for the Leader of the Opposition being empowered here is to ensure that there is a smooth consensus process in the nomination of a President. If another party in this place had five members, that party should be involved in that. That makes good democratic sense and I support the amendment.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

I intend to take out the words from `each' through to `Parliament'. So out would come `each political party with at least 5 members in the Parliament' to substitute the words `the opposition'. So I will read it to ensure that the Senate is clear on my intention. The amendment will now read:</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the Prime Minister's motion is not supported by the Leader of the Opposition or is not affirmed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister must, within 6 weeks of the joint sitting of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, move in another joint sitting that another named Australian citizen be chosen as the President.</para><para>I would like to make some brief remarks. I hope Senator Brown took note that I used the word `must' in line with my previous support for his intentions in that area. Section 60 does not provide for a scenario where the Prime Minister's nominee is not approved by parliament. We all know that in politics you can never be certain of what is to come. If there is one thing you learn in politics it is that that is a fact. Section 60 should provide that, where the Prime Minister's motion to appoint an individual is unsuccessful, a different candidate must be put forward at another sitting within a specified period. In this amendment I have suggested six weeks. The Senate may choose to vary that period. But the point is that you cannot have a situation which is left without resolution, in my view.</para><para>You also have to pay attention to the fact that it may be in the interests of the Prime Minister of the day to have such a situation. There may be a time when a Prime Minister might see leaving the office vacant as helpful to his or her political aims, or they might choose to leave the office vacant for a period in order to pressure the parliament to approve a nomination which the parliament or the Leader of the Opposition plainly do not want 
 to support. All this amendment is trying to do is ensure that there cannot be such an event.</para><para>I do not believe from my understanding and reading of the Constitutional Convention's proposals or my understanding and reading of the committee report or indeed of anything I have heard from the supporters of the appointment model that what I am proposing goes against either the spirit or the intention of what they were trying to pursue. In a sense, this is a technical amendment, but I also think it covers an area where there might be genuine political dangers. I think it is wise to guard against them. Accordingly, with those brief remarks, I move:</para><para>(4)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (after line 5), insert:</para><para>If the Prime Minister's motion is not supported by the leader of the opposition, or is not affirmed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister must, within 6 weeks of the joint sitting of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, move in another joint sitting that another named Australian citizen be chosen as the President.</para><para>The second paragraph of this section applies to any joint sitting of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives convened to choose a President.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7241</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes this amendment. It is a technical one. We do not think it is necessary. We anticipate, and I think quite fairly so, that the pressures of the time will ensure that if the first nominee is not accepted by the houses of parliament there will very quickly be action to ensure that someone is appointed to the position of President. Politically, it would leave a vacuum at the top of the constitutional structure and parliaments would be compelled to act.</para></talk.start><para>This might be a technical question, but it is also one which has a number of unintended consequences. I think the committee ought to be aware of those as well, because I think Senator Murray is indulging, maybe unwittingly, in a degree of trickery this time. He recommits the issue of `may' or `must'. He has acknowledged that. But what he is also doing here is broadening the range of people 
 who would be eligible to be appointed President after the initial nominee fails. He says in the last part of his amendment `that another named Australian citizen be chosen as the President'. The range of people who are eligible to be chosen for the President the first time around is in fact a smaller range than Australian citizens. The prerequisite qualification provisions are in the bill. They are linked very clearly to eligibility and qualification for the houses of the Australian parliament.</para><para>The wording in Senator Murray's amendment widens that. To be qualified to be a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate you cannot, for instance, be a person holding joint citizenship. You have to have renounced any other citizenship to which you may be entitled. Your provision does not have that qualification proviso. Your provision says `any named Australian citizen', and that is indeed much wider than the qualification provisions for the first nominee. The amendment, unnecessary and technical though it might be, also has a number of unintended consequences. The opposition cannot support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>7241</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the amendment.

 major exigencies. That is what Senator Murray's amendment does. It is rather fatuous of the Labor Party or the government to simply say, `Oh well, we'll leave it to the political pressure of the day to solve the problem,' when here we have the opportunity of laying down a prescription which is not going to allow the problem to occur in the first place.

But, in trying to do that, they brought forward such an array of laws that the matter became subject to interpretation and subject to the lawyers and the courts.</para></talk.start><para>What has been overlooked here is the political pressure.

It relies very much on the force of the people through the political power they have not only at the ballot box but also in terms of the reaction they take to particular propositions.

To take away that direct pressure of the people and to put this into the hands of the courts seems to me to be against the thrust of what we should be about and falls into that category against which Sir Isaac Isaacs counselled back in the 1890s.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7242</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I associate myself with the remarks of my learned friend Senator Cooney. Certainly, increased prescription increases the recipe for litigation, for the intervention of the courts, which is undesirable. The court of public opinion would have great effect here 
 and has had great effect since Federation in 1901.</para></talk.start><para>It is the government's view that to have the prescription of a six-week time limit would be unreasonable and would lead to the sort of scrutiny mentioned by Senator Cooney. The process would not be accommodated adequately by having that six-week time limit. If the parliament could not achieve a two-thirds majority to approve the candidate for President then the process would have to be started again. There is no reason the repeat process should not go through the same processes as in the first instance. What you are saying here is that if you get it wrong in the first instance you do not do the same again; you do a much shorter version of the first try.</para><para>The government is of the view that this would be unduly prescriptive and that it would be appropriate to go back and start again. There is a provision for an Acting President and there would be no harm done if an Acting President was appointed in the interim. That person would be the most senior state Governor at the time. That would be an adequate circumstance. One other thing I will point out—and this is a very strong point—is that this was not something that came from the Constitutional Convention or the joint select committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7242</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Sir Isaac Isaacs said to give power to the people and we have been repeating that in our own way this morning. Senator Cooney and the government are saying, `Yes, but not to the lawyers.' He did not mean for it to be given to the politicians. He certainly did not mean for it all to be accreted to the Prime Minister and the unelected advisers in the Prime Minister's office.</para></talk.start><para>We are saying that the Prime Minister should have to act to appoint a President. We have failed to establish that the people's nominations will necessarily be the ones the Prime Minister puts forward. Senator Ellison, in representing the government, is now saying, `You would have to go back and start the process again.' I submit that a Prime Minister worth his or her salt would go straight back to the nominations and put forward an alterna 
 tive. To leave the space vacant might seem appealing to the big parties whose Prime Minister is going to be in office at the time because it would give all power to the Prime Minister but it is not in the best interests of the people.</para><para>For Senator Ellison to suggest that the Prime Minister would not have the wit or wisdom in these circumstances to come up with another nominee within six weeks is laughable. Of course they would. Senator Bolkus said, `In this circumstance, parliaments would be compelled to act and there would be political pressure put on them.' That is the same as saying six weeks is plenty of time. The Prime Minister would have to act. All the better if, in the Constitution, there is a time limit. To suggest that six weeks is not enough time to put forward a nomination to fill a vacancy does not withstand any sort of scrutiny.</para><para>Once again, we are putting a very limited but reasonable set of guidelines to a Prime Minister in office to contain that Prime Minister so that they simply cannot make this into a political football match, that they have some limitations on what they do and that, if we do get into a mess over the appointment of a President further down the line, the Australian people are simply not left to wait out the duration of whichever government is in power at the time before they can do something about it at the ballot box.

 Parliament or Territory legislature, or a member of a political party.</para><para>This amendment arises from issues dealt with in paragraph 3.74 and onwards of the joint select committee report. It deals with the point at which someone should be qualified to be considered as a candidate for President. We have provided in section 60:</para><para>(i)	 the person is qualified to be, and capable of being chosen as, a member of the House of Representatives;  and</para><para>(ii)	 the person is not a member of the Commonwealth Parliament or a State Parliament or Territory legislature, or a member of a political party.</para><para>There were some queries raised during the hearings of the joint committee that you might have some very good people who are ineligible to qualify as President but nonetheless could still be so because they could remedy those disabilities, if you like, in the interim. It was thought that the effect of this section, in its current form, might preclude good people from being considered whilst they were not eligible to qualify as President notwithstanding that they could subsequently qualify. The committee report states:</para><para>While acknowledging that proposed s.60 in its present form is probably satisfactory, the Committee takes the view that it would be valuable if the Republic Bill contained an express statement of exactly when the qualification requirements must be satisfied. The Committee suggests that the appropriate time would be at the time the Prime Minister puts the motion to Parliament.</para><para>That is when the Prime Minister, with the seconding of the Leader of the Opposition, would go to the joint houses of the parliament and put up the name of the candidate. At that point the candidate should be qualified. So we propose to amend section 60 to allow that. Previously, whilst the nominations committee is considering eligible candidates or prospective candidates, that person may or may not meet the qualifications for President but in the interim that can be remedied. If you did have it so rigid, you could rule out the consideration of what might be some excellent candidates for President.</para><para>The government thought that section 60 could accommodate that but, having regard to the concerns of the committee, the govern 
 ment thought it would make it absolutely clear. So we have made a slight alteration to the wording of this amendment to read:</para><para>The person named in the Prime Minister's motion is qualified to be chosen as President if, when the motion is moved and affirmed:</para><para>(i)	 the person is qualified to be, and capable of being chosen as, a member of the House of Representatives; and</para><para>(ii)	 the person is not a member of the Commonwealth Parliament or a State Parliament or Territory legislature, or a member of a political party.</para><para>The seminal point in time, if you like, is when that person's name is put forward in the parliament. Previously, that person does not have to qualify so long as they qualify at the time the motion is put.

I think this is an 
 absolutely delicious amendment. I am not going to oppose it, but I regard it as delicious because it is designed to put another little firework, if you like, in the whole republic debate. Out there the supporters of the appointment model have been busy running the myth, the untruth, the misrepresentation that the appointment model will somehow prevent politicians becoming the President of the republic of Australia. As we know, that is arrant nonsense in terms of the history of Australia. Two-thirds of all governors-general have been politicians and I, for one, am a great supporter of any politician with the appropriate credentials becoming the President. Why not? They are people who have great experience of affairs of state. I can think of many past parliamentarians who would fulfil the office of President very acceptably in my view, so I have no philosophical opposition to this.</para></talk.start><para>But let us make it clear—and this is why I regard it as so delicious in this debate—that instead of the previous part of the bill which would have prevented any member of parliament being put forward as a nominee to the committee, because they would have had to resign before they could even be put forward to be chosen, now they can be discussed whilst they are a sitting member and, if put forward, then they can resign once the deal is done. I think this is absolutely exquisite. Here is the way in which a serving politician can become President.</para><para>Let me say to everybody again: I do not object to a politician being President but let nobody who supports the appointed model run around and say that their model will guarantee that politicians do not run the show, do not elect the President, do not fix whom the President will be and do not manoeuvre the situation so they can get a President in if that is what they wish. Of course they might choose not to do so. They might choose to pursue a very esteemed judge, as we have at present, and that is terrific.

I offer you my sincere congratulations for your unopposed re-election last Monday. The unanimous and enthusiastic praises offered to you on Monday by all parties on that occasion clearly indicate how well you have occupied this office these past three years. I am sure that your coming term will prove to be equally successful. I should also offer my congratulations to Senator West for her unopposed re-election as Deputy President. I trust that she will accept that what I 
 have just said about you, Madam President, equally applies to her.</para></talk.start><para>It is a great honour for any individual to become a member of the Australian Senate. I am very conscious of that. When I first came to Australia 42 years ago as a young man still at school, the thought of one day becoming a member of the Australian Senate was far from my mind. Indeed, even the possibility of becoming an Australian citizen was not really on the agenda, as I did not expect to stay longer than the completion of my studies. In those days, Australia was still thought of as white Australia. People of Asian background and, indeed, even Europeans of non-British background were not generally welcome as settlers, although the construction of the Snowy Mountains hydro scheme and the inflow of migrants to meet this demand and other labour demands were beginning to cause a change in attitude.</para><para>Since then, as a result of continuing urban development coupled with maintenance of a steady inflow of migrants, Australia has grown and changed from an isolated outpost of England, a minor player in the affairs of the British Empire, to be a significant power in the Asia-Pacific region. We were then a supplier of low value primary products to the British Isles. We are now a mixed trading nation strong enough to stand the impact of the East Asian economic meltdown without so much as losing a beat. We were then a cultural backwater best known for being the set of the filming of <inline font-style="italic">On the beach</inline>, a film about the end of the world. Today we boast some of the most livable cities in the world. We were then an emphatically single culture society. We are now one of the most successful multicultural societies in the world, where people who would have been at each other's throats, had they stayed in the places they came from, now live and work peacefully side by side.</para><para>As a nation, we have improved our station significantly. The evolution of our multicultural society is both the cause and the result of this improvement. Today, more than one in three of the adult population of Australia was born in other countries, some of which no longer exist except in memory. More than one in four of the population speaks a language 
 other than English. It is in this context that I think that my election to the Senate has special significance, serving as a reinforcing symbol and a call to those who are Australians by choice that they belong. It is also an act of affirmation by the people of Australia that every Australian, regardless of his or her cultural or historic background, stands equal in the eyes of his or her fellow citizens.</para><para>As we enter the 21st century, the world we are in is, in many respects, a place of even greater uncertainty. In this world, Australia, with the advantage of our geography and our history, has the chance to become a source of hope and an example for all to follow. We have a responsibility to make multiculturalism—that means an equal right and opportunity for every citizen to contribute to the growth and development of our common community—work for Australia and contribute to world peace and prosperity.</para><para>I am both proud and humbled that I now have the opportunity to be a harbinger of hope from Australia to the rest of the world. This would not be possible without the support and endorsement of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party and its members have, for many years, given me much appreciated fellowship and encouragement, for which I thank them. I especially thank the Victorian division of the Liberal Party for having the confidence and the courage to choose me by way of a well-proven, merit based preselection process to represent the Liberal Party before the people of Victoria, who were pleased to endorse me.</para><para>I am proud and gratified that all this has come to pass and that I am here. My mission now is to serve in the Senate for the advancement of Australia and Australians to the best of my ability, and I shall do so according to the Liberal principles of freedom, responsibility, endeavour and compassion. I am proud to be a long-serving and committed member of the Liberal Party. As Liberals, we share a belief in the fundamental freedoms of man—freedom to think, freedom to choose, freedom to speak and freedom to worship. As a group of individuals, we share a belief that it is not only our right but also our responsibility to develop our aspirations to the best of our 
 ability and to allow others to develop their aspirations in a like manner. We share a belief in compassion and responsibility for our fellow men and women. We share a belief in the moral courage and decency, imagination and creativities of the Australian people. Finally, we share an appreciation of the uniquely Australian values of a fair go, of giving it one's best shot and of mateship.</para><para>I acknowledge that our political opponents, the Labor Party, also espouse some values similar to our beliefs. This is fortunate, since it gives us the opportunity of dialogue, though limited because of Labor's obligatory intractabilities. Nonetheless, there is a fundamental difference between us. Our beliefs are founded on the concepts of individual initiatives and individual responsibility. The Labor Party's dogma, on the other hand, denies that the concept of the individual exists or has any beneficial quality. Consequently, the Labor Party does not believe anything should be done by the individual; rather, it believes everything must be done for the individual.</para><para>We see this difference most obviously in how members of the Labor Party persistently use the term `the government' as something intrinsically and distinctly different from `the people'. They say, `The government must do this or that,' `Why doesn't the government do that?' and so on. But what is government if it is not the people? Are we not a democracy? Do we not have a government of the people, for the people and by the people? Why should the government and the community of people be separate entities?</para><para>If you suppose the government is to be an entity separate from the people who created it, you diminish the people. If you empower the government more than necessary, you diminish the individual's ability to flourish. Every function you allow the government to take over makes the individual less self-reliant. We say the government should have only those functions that individuals, or a cooperative collection of individuals, are not able to carry out efficiently. A government should be only large enough to carry out its designed purposes efficiently. Overall efficiency in the delivery of goods and services in accordance with a community's needs is 
 the final measure of whether government should be involved in an enterprise.</para><para>In a democratic society, government is not an end in itself but only the means to achieve an end—the community's gain. Public sector profit is not community wealth unless it generates wealth within a community. Public sector employment creation does not reduce long-term unemployment unless it facilitates and supports the ability of individuals within the community to create new jobs. Therefore, I believe all Australians would endorse the policies that the Howard government has implemented to successfully restore and strengthen Australia's economic framework. I believe the government's planned legislation to further strengthen frameworks for the economy and for employment, education, health and regional services is essential for the betterment of Australia. I shall look forward to making a contribution in critical areas.</para><para>I come to the Senate with the single objective of serving the interests of Australia as a senator of Liberal persuasion representing the people of Victoria. I come without a personal agenda or burning issues to champion. Having said this, I do have a number of issues which I would like to lay before senators for their consideration. These are underlying issues. Madam President, as I am not very good at controlling time yet, perhaps you would permit me to raise them later if I have time.</para><para>I would now like to give thanks to the many people who have encouraged me and supported me over the years. I recall a Chinese proverb that says, `When at home, one could depend on one's parents for comfort but, when away, one must look to one's friends for support.' I left home at an early age to come to Australia. To get to where I am today, I have been fortunate to have had many such friends to whom I could look and have looked for support. There are too many to thank individually, except those who are present. I hope that absent friends will recognise themselves in those who are here as their representatives. I would like to acknowledge the support and encouragement of these people. I thank the senators on this side, particularly the leadership team; my Victorian 
 colleagues; and Senator Cooney on the other side, a gentleman and a scholar—a member of the Labor Party notwithstanding.</para><para>I would also like to say welcome to those who are present from my fellow class of 1999, or the `Y2K minus 1' intake. I know Senator Mason, Senator Ludwig, Senator McLucas and Senator Greig are all part of a generational change that occurs from time to time and which is the underlying strength of our parliamentary system. I wish them a successful and rewarding career. Senator Ridgeway, in addition to being part of this generational change, shares with me the role of demonstrating the affirmative endorsement by the mainstream community of our evolving multicultural society. I wish him well also, and I ask him to convey my respects to the Ngunnawal people. At first sight, Senator Harris and I may appear to be heading in diametrically opposed directions. However, if I understand Senator Harris correctly, he and I have common ground as to some of the problems facing our nation. I hope that we have appropriate opportunities to resolve some of those problems cooperatively.</para><para>Up in the gallery, I see Colin Carson, a typical salt-of-the-earth Liberal Party member. With him is Dr Tom Leung, a fourth generation Chinese Australian whose life and achievements—during a period when to be different was to be suspect—helped to change attitudes towards people from different backgrounds. Thank you for coming. From Sydney, I see Hudson Chen and Eve Chen. As a venture capital merchant banker, Hudson represents the benefits the second wave of Asian migration can bring to Australia. Thank you for coming also.</para><para>I would be remiss if I failed to mention my lineal predecessor in the Senate. Jim Short was one of the Senate's outstanding quiet achievers. He made his mark during a long career in the Commonwealth parliament, first in the lower house and then, more enduringly, in the Senate. As we all know, his political career was cut short by one of those minute technicalities that from time to time complicate the life of a politician in the manner of a great fuss being made over a small amount of tea being spilt from the cup to the saucer. 
 However, I am pleased to say that, in this case, justice was quickly done. Jim Short has continued to serve Australia's interest from his appointment on the board of the European Reconstruction Bank.</para><para>Jim Short's contribution to our nation is not limited to his role in parliament, illustrious as it was. He is best remembered, still, for his long and committed effort to building understanding and coherent bonds between Australia's migrant communities and the mainstream community. He succeeded well; I can attest to that without fear of contradiction. He succeeded in migrant communities not because he looked like a member of one of those communities—he certainly did not—or because he spoke their languages—he did not, nor did he pretend to—or because he made promises about what he could or would do for them—he did not. But he listened. This was not because he always had a rollicking good time—in fact, he often looked distinctly lost at ethnic functions. Jim Short was always accepted and welcome because he was always honest, fair and compassionate, in the archetypical manner of a true-blue Australian, in his dealings with people of different backgrounds. That manner is what gives reassurance and confidence to newcomers to this land. We all owe much to Jim Short and others like him for the vitality and stability of our Australian society.</para><para>I said earlier that I had a couple of issues that, if I had time, I would like to raise for senators' consideration. As a professional town planner before I came to the Senate, one of the matters which I had long been conscious of in our developing nation was that, because of the different pace of different kinds of developments over the years, we quite often find significant discrepancies between availability of service by the provider and accessibility to service and facilities by the user. Because of the way that services and facilities are usually measured—they tend to be measured from the provider's point of view—we quite often get a situation, particularly in country regions, where on paper there is quite an adequate supply of services and yet it is extremely difficult for the person on the ground to actually reach them.</para><para>I think this is one of the factors which, since 1996 through to 1999, has caused the tremendous political upheaval, particularly in country regions, otherwise known as the One Nation phenomenon. I think this is something which again many other people have noted. I noticed that Senator Payne, in the adjournment debate on Monday night, spoke on the IT disadvantages and information poverty of women, especially in regional areas—this is the sort of thing that I am referring to. The facilities are available on a regional basis, but on the individual basis they are extremely hard to access. I think that is something which we as a nation ought to start thinking about—that is, how to measure availability of service on the basis of access rather than availability.</para><para>I see that my time is running short, so perhaps I should close. In closing, Madam President, if I may be allowed to say a few words to my family—my family is up there in the gallery. I want to say to Pauline, my wife, friend and partner of 30 years: thank you—down here is where you should be. To my children, Jacinta and Adrian—Adrian is actually not here; he does not want to miss too many lectures: you have brought us much joy and a little pain from time to time, but it is worth it. I say to my father: when I left home you told me, `You are going to a new country to live among strangers. Always remember who you are and where you came from; always behave in such a way that those who knew you will not be disgraced because the new people that you live with will judge them by you. You should always realise where you are going and who you can be. Always strive for purpose, so that the expectation of those among whom you will live shall not be disappointed, because they will be judged by your success or not.' Father, I hope that I have met your wishes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

 Hanson's One Nation. This seat was won by Heather Hill, who led One Nation's Senate ticket. A High Court challenge and a controversial decision that Great Britain is a foreign power under the terms of the Australian Constitution ruled Heather ineligible to take her place in this chamber. I respect Heather and have no doubt that she would have made a fine representative in the Senate for the people of Queensland.</para></talk.start><para>I have been given an opportunity that I will not take lightly or for granted. I am pleased that Heather with Bronwyn, Brett and Joan are working with me to achieve the goals and objectives that have made Pauline Hanson's One Nation a new political force. This change is long overdue in a country that has been governed for too long by Tweedledee and Tweedledum.</para><para>I wish to make a very special thank you to my wife, Betty; to my children, Kent, Brendon and Dene, and their partners; and to my parents, Enid and Jack. To the team in North Queensland: thank you for your support.</para><para>We believe that truth will always prevail. We are very conscious of the words of Arthur Schopenhauer:</para><para>All truth passes through three stages. First it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident.</para><para>I am going to use this opportunity to peel away the myths surrounding One Nation and present some facts; to explain the platform of positive changes that drove me to stand up for my children and grandchildren and future generations of Australians; and to present the positive faces of those involved in this new development in Australia's political history.</para><para>I believe that a safe, secure and prosperous society depends on the integrity and sanctity of the traditional family unit. I am appalled that approximately one million children do not live with their fathers in Australia. During my trips around Queensland, I have been inundated with pleas for help from non-custodial parents who have been deprived of access to their children. Divorce is unfortunate but possibly the only solution for some families. But we must remember that children ideally should have a mother and a father. 
 Denial of parental and grandparents' contact with children I believe is synonymous with child abuse.</para><para>Maintenance is a necessary tool to ensure that parents do not abdicate their parental responsibilities. But providers should not be forced into poverty and a position that restricts their opportunity to develop a new family. We advocate that the Family Law Court should be abolished and replaced with family tribunals. The current system is too expensive and too adversarial, and children are used like pawns in a game of chess. Family tribunals allow for consultation with no legal representation where quick talking and well-paid lawyers can confuse the issue.</para><para>Senior Magistrate Stan Deers has accused some partners of using domestic violence orders to enhance their opportunity to seek custody of their children, as stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> on 5 July 1995. People who make vexatious or malicious domestic violence orders should face the full force of the law and pay costs.</para><para>The current formula for determining child maintenance is unfair and unworkable and needs to be scrapped. Non-custodial parents want to provide for their children, but under the current system most are left in a life of poverty with no future of having another family life and in a lot of cases unemployed because that is the only way to survive. Suicide and murder have plagued many families. Members of the parliament must work together to find fair solutions.</para><para>The disabled in our society are some of the most overlooked members of our community. We recognise that many Australians have disabilities and benefit from, and contribute to, living in the community, but there are others who require centre based care. Both options require services with realistic staffing levels and adequate funding as a priority.</para><para>Aged care is not a social welfare burden; it is a just entitlement. The current consumer price index based method of calculating benefits does not reflect the cost of living of our pensioners. Self-funded retirees have worked responsibly to provide for themselves in their later years only to be faced with deeming on their investments. Deeming on 
 their investments, savings and transfer of assets should be abolished. Community transport services, home help and support services are provided to ensure that the elderly can enjoy a safe and comfortable lifestyle in their surroundings for as long as they desire. It is time that we stopped expecting the aged and frail to erect bars on their windows and live in a virtual prison whilst criminals are treated with kid gloves. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister for adopting One Nation policy and recommending a referendum on capital punishment.</para><para>Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to state my position on a controversial subject and correct some of the misunderstandings and untruths that have been propagated by our political opponents. As a result of Pauline raising the issue of immigration, it is pleasing to see that the major political parties have reassessed their policies. Australia has benefited from immigration. However, there is no doubt that previous government immigration, population policies and practices were implemented for their votes and not for the wellbeing and future of our nation, as stated by Barry Jones, the previous member for Lalor.</para><para>The fact is that, until very recently, the discussion of immigration was sternly discouraged because the government and the opposition did not want to discuss it, along with many other issues. The policy of immigration requires a process of balance. On one hand we have concern for the migrant and on the other we have concern for the host country and its people who will be supporting, accepting and providing a new home for the migrant. Employment, hospitals, nursing homes and infrastructure must be addressed before any future burden is carried by the taxpayers and all Australians.</para><para>Our policy of net zero immigration would result in approximately 30,000 new immigrations each year. Our policy of not exceeding net zero immigration is because we believe Australia is near her carrying capacity. A population policy must be the result of unbiased scientific thinking and must not be highjacked by self-interested pro-immigration elites, including big business who are all too 
 frequently chasing profits, not Australia's interests. Immigration mistakes are big mistakes; they do not go away, they just continue to get more expensive for the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>Quality in the immigration debate is still lacking, particularly from some of our political and media opponents. There are still many legitimate questions to be asked regarding Australia's population and immigration policy, and I defend the rights of Australian people to continue to discuss and determine these issues.</para><para>Multiculturalism should be killed stone dead. Immigration could have a negative impact on Australia. The Labor Party was a haven for a growing band of family dynasties. Bill Hayden, a former Governor-General and Leader of the Labor Party, made the statement that endorses One Nation's principles. Australia is a multiracial country but multiculturalism will destroy us as a nation and a cohesive society. Whatever our cultural background may be we must consider ourselves to be Australians  first and foremost. As one migrant has stated to me, home is not where you are born but where you are prepared to die.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 27 July 1999 carried a report from the Social Policy Research Centre that states that almost one-third of Australians feel they have lost control of their economic future and worry about losing their jobs. The orthodox economic policies implemented by our governments have clearly failed to improve the standard of living for the majority of Australian people.</para><para>Pauline Hanson's One Nation is strongly opposed to free trade as it currently operates. Our citrus, lamb, pork, rice and sugar industries, to name a few, have found out the hard way that free trade is a misnomer. We want fair trade, not free trade. We also oppose the policies that have sent our manufacturing industries overseas, along with thousands of Australian jobs. No country can remain wealthy without a strong manufacturing and value adding industrial base. We are increasingly dependent on foreign goods to satisfy basic demands, creating more social and economic problems. The only way out of this 
 mess is to re-industrialise this country. We have to stop being the world's quarry pit and start transforming our natural resources into finished products. It makes no sense to sell iron ore for a pittance and buy back steel. It makes no sense to export woodchips and import paper. It makes no sense to export silica sand and import fibre optics. Our rural industries need support to transform their raw commodities to value added products. Steps must be taken to protect our standard of living by increasing selective tariffs to protect Australian jobs.</para><para>We need to further encourage Australian industries by introducing truth in labelling that will enable consumers to clearly identify genuinely Australian owned and made products. Most Australians will buy Australian made and owned products if they can find them on the grocery shelves. Australia must not be seen as a tax haven for multinationals who pay little or no tax at all, while small business and PAYE citizens carry the burden. If they do not like it, they can leave and small business and Australian companies will fill the void.</para><para>Foreign ownership of our enterprises should not exceed 49 per cent. Foreign ownership of our assets is unacceptably high. We have signed 41 international tax agreements which give foreign owned companies a competitive advantage over Australian companies. By virtue of paying little or no tax they have a market advantage that enables them to out price and out service those Australian companies and businesses which pay their taxes. The government does not publish accurate and concise information about the level of foreign ownership of our land, businesses, companies and natural resources. When Pauline Hanson was a member of parliament even she could not access this information. What hope does the general public have?</para><para>Multinationals buy out their competition and monopolise the markets. Examples of multinationals destroying Australian owned companies are Conagra and Boral. Not only have they bought out their competitors and monopolised the market but government has financially assisted one of these multinationals in their expansion, whilst their Queensland 
 owned competitor was thrown to the wolves and Queenslanders lost their jobs. We must protect Australian industries and protect Australian jobs like the United States protects theirs.</para><para>National competition policy is a textbook theory which has failed in practice. The Labor government must be held accountable for the pain and suffering inflicted on the Australian people through its national competition policy legislation. Proudly introduced and implemented by Mr Keating and the Labor Party and supported by the Liberal and National parties, this legislation has destroyed and continues to destroy the livelihoods of many in rural and regional areas, especially is Queensland, which is the most decentralised state in Australia.</para><para>Australians are demoralised at having a government and its agencies fail to defend our country's interests. The devastation of the lamb, pork and rice industries and the government's recent decision to allow the importation of salmon, with its potential to irreversibly damage the environment and industry, are unforgivable. The government are acting against the interests of those people who voted them in as their representatives to protect their rights and interests. Are milk, bread, electricity or local government rates any cheaper as a result of the national competition policy? A mixture of market forces and government controls in certain circumstances can operate for the overall public benefit. Although the economic purists hate to admit it, this mixture of market forces and government intervention is necessary to preserve an adequate level of competition and consumer choice. This mixture preserves the economic opportunities for the whole community, not just the big end of town.</para><para>The main problem with the national competition policy has been its overzealous implementation with little or no regard to the anti-competitive nature of unregulated markets and with little or no regard to the very real social costs of national competition policy. Pauline Hanson's One Nation supports a mixed economy that has two sorts of government controls: controls on big business that prevent oligopolies and outright monopolies forming, 
 and measures that support small and medium size business to compete with big business. This counterbalances advantages enjoyed by the multinationals and big business, which include superior purchasing power, taxation advantages and economies of scale. This helps to ensure that the elusive level playing field can be achieved. The economic cost to consumers of protecting manufacturing industry is justified by the social benefits, more Australian jobs and less Australian debt. Australia is resource rich. We should be leading world technology, not selling our intellectual resources overseas where multinational companies can exploit them with minimal benefits for Australians.</para><para>The protection of our workers' entitlements is very important, and I am pleased to see that the government and the opposition are now taking this matter seriously. However, it was not until Pauline Hanson released her policy to protect workers' entitlements in 1998 that Labor or the coalition displayed an enthusiasm to fix this most serious problem.</para><para>Inland tourism is an industry with fantastic potential to be developed. For too long Australian promotions have concentrated on the eastern seaboard. The Australian outback is beautiful, and I will be doing my best to ensure that we promote the western side of the Great Divide to tourists and overseas visitors as well as the eastern seaboard.</para><para>Small businesses are doing it tough for a variety of reasons, but our unfair dismissal laws are adding to the problem. Unfair dismissal legislation as it presently stands is a disincentive to increasing small business employment, and I would like to work with the government to help our small business operators achieve their full potential.</para><para>There is a place for unions in Australia to protect the workers' rights. Enterprise bargaining has the potential to take away hard fought rights of workers. We do not support compulsory unionism, as it is an infringement of freedom of choice and freedom of association and encourages complacency on the part of the unions. We do not approve of the practice of channelling money from membership fees to political parties without the authorisation of the member.</para><para>Australians have a long and for the most part successful relationship with firearms, and I do not believe that imposing national gun laws was the correct action to deal with an increasingly violent, divided and amoral society. We believe that decent, law-abiding citizens should have reasonable access to firearms for legitimate reasons.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Harris, you have gone over your time.

I have referred to the committee and the minister important evidence and documents from a recent Supreme Court of the Northern Territory case before Justice Angel. The case, Peter Julian Hansen v. Northern Land Coun 
 cil, raises additional questions for the committee's examination of the Reeves report and the administration of Northern Territory land councils, particularly the Northern Land Council.</para></talk.start><para>The evidence presented in this unfair dismissal case, which includes documents subpoenaed from the Northern Land Council, shows that the executive officers of the NLC developed a sophisticated scheme to misappropriate moneys from the then Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account (ABTA), now known as the Aboriginal Benefits Reserve (ABR). The illegal and immoral actions of the Northern Land Council and its executive relating to this scam initially took place in 1991. Unfortunately, the Labor government turned a blind eye to proper scrutiny and supervision of the land councils for obvious political reasons.</para><para>These activities were nothing more than a series of corporate raids by some Aboriginal leaders and their legal advisers. It amounted to a scheme to gain control of assets in case the land councils were ever to be taken out of legislative existence. The scheme revolved around the purchase of a building in Darwin, Mitbul House, by the NLC and four regional offices in Borroloola, Daly River, Timber Creek and Ngukurr. It involved a complex creative accounting scheme and utilised a veil of companies and trusts.</para><para>A dummy organisation with charitable status was set up, called the North Australian Aboriginal Corporation (NAAC). This organisation channelled  the misappropriated funds from the ABTA through the North Australian Investment Corporation (NAIC), acting as a trustee through the Northern Australian Aboriginal Charitable Trust (NAACT). A sum of $1,667,726 was initially misappropriated from the ABTA and used to purchase Mitbul House, the current NLC offices. A further sum of approximately $500,000 was misappropriated and relates to the regional offices. Let me quote from the chronological review of trial evidence by the plaintiff's lawyers, which was submitted to Justice Angel:</para><para>At 23/7/91</para><para> "Between this date and 31 December 1991, in breach of s.35(1) and s.36 of Aboriginal Land 
 Rights (NT) Act, the Defendant paid $1,667,726 of its available funds to NAAC (an inappropriate recipient set up by the NLC and NAIC and in fact a sham entity) being payments not approved by the Minister under s.34, and being $501,238 in excess of any payment that could be authorized by s.35(1), on any interpretation."</para><para>The boards of these front organisations were largely composed of the same people and, astoundingly, this is even acknowledged in the 1991-92 Northern Land Council annual report with the following line:</para><para>The members of N.A.A.C. are the Trustees of the North Australian Charitable Trust and the Trustees of the Trust are the Directors of the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation (N.A.I.C.).</para><para>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time, the Hon. Robert Tickner, gave specific instructions regarding the use of surplus funds from the ABTA and, unfortunately, the NLC executive actively conspired to deceive the minister. Rent was charged by the NAAC to the NLC at the rate of $340,000 per annum, a further misuse of moneys which should have been going to Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory for their benefit.</para><para>But, in a further damning indictment of these sham organisations, the directors of the NAAC—of which Mick Dodson was one—approved the rental moneys that the NAAC received from the NLC being treated as a grant to the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation (NAIC). Let me quote again from the trial evidence:</para><para>"No more cogent evidence of NAAC's sham character could be adduced. The defendant's "rent", in the order of $340,000 per annum, did not begin until 1/7/91 and this record clearly shows that from that date the Defendant paid its "rent" to NAIC not to NAAC and even more importantly NAIC treated the money as belonging to it."</para><para>It is interesting to note the conflicts of interests of many NLC officials. Mick Dodson—who subsequently became Labor's appointed Social Justice Commissioner—as director of the NLC played a big hand in this scheme. He was aware of it, he condoned it and he worked actively with others to achieve it.</para><para>Another of those whom Mr Dodson worked with was his mentor and predecessor as director of the NLC, Mr John Ah Kit. Mr Ah 
 Kit, now the member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, was the director of the NLC when the scheme was concocted. He is one of those responsible for this misuse of power and ABTA funds. Mr Ah Kit should resign from parliament, as the very people he claims to represent are those that have suffered due to the fact they have not received funds that are rightfully theirs.</para><para>I have recently called for the activities of the then, and now, Labor Northern Territory federal member, Warren Snowdon, and the Northern Land Council to be investigated by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. There is evidence from the Hansen v. Northern Land Council trial judgment that shows a close and improper relationship between Mr Snowdon and the NLC, particularly in relation to the drafting of correspondence for the NLC by Mr Snowdon and assistance during elections.</para><para>One wonders just how far this close relationship goes, what involvement Mr Snowdon had with the NLC in-group and whether he knew of any cover-up with the Labor minister for aboriginal affairs. If he was involved, like Mr Ah Kit, he should resign from parliament. The particularly worrying aspect of this scheme, apart from the obvious improprieties, is the fact that it took a Supreme Court case for the evidence to be forthcoming. At no stage was an effort made by any subsequent executive of the NLC to resolve the issue and return the misappropriated funds to the Aboriginal benefits reserve.</para><para>In fact, over the course of several years there has been an active effort by many at the NLC to cover up this conspiracy. This is a despicable state of affairs and those involved should hang their heads in shame. The hypocrisy of these so-called Aboriginal leaders is absolutely breathtaking. They should apologise to their Aboriginal constituency in the Northern Territory for the wrong that they have bestowed on them. This is not simply a case of money being misused and abused by those who felt they did not need to be accountable to anyone, including their own people, but much more. It is an example of the misuse of `surplus' funds leading to the need for subsequent budget and staff cuts, 
 with a resultant lack of service to the NLC's constituency—the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.</para><para>It is an example of Aboriginal leaders and their policy advisers misleading their own people and doing what they think is best for them—paternalism at its worst. Worst of all, it is an example of people in positions of power abusing a trust that is placed in them to serve honourably. It is a pity that this type of thing makes it much more difficult for honest Aboriginal leaders to overcome the stereotypes and prejudices created by such crooks.</para><para>The matters raised in evidence to the Supreme Court now require urgent attention by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Further detailed inquiry must be undertaken as a matter of urgency to correct past breaches of trust and to ensure that the future administration of land councils is on a proper footing.</para><para>In his judgment on the NLC v. Hansen case, Justice Angel made very discerning and concerning comments about the honesty, reliability, motives and characters of Mr Mick Dodson and the former NLC staffer, now spin doctor to Warren Snowdon, Mr Tony Haritos. In his judgment, Justice Angel said the following regarding Mr Dodson's evidence:</para><para>Mr Dodson, whilst having the opportunity to refresh his memory from contemporaneous records of the defendant, did not do so. He lacked a memory for detail, was not as conscientious as he might have been, and I regret to say, on occasions, did not give honest answers.</para><para>This is extremely strong and damning language from a Supreme Court judge, particularly when it concerns a person of Mick Dodson's public standing—a former Australian of the Year and Social Justice Commissioner. With regard to Tony Haritos, then media officer for the Northern Land Council and now Mr Warren Snowdon's spin doctor, Justice Angel said:</para><para>Mr Haritos, a former employee of the defendant, was a biased and untrustworthy witness who was quite unreliable. I do not accept the truth of Mr 
 Haritos's evidence, save where it is consistent with the evidence of the plaintiff.</para><para>Yet again, that is a damning condemnation of a witness by a Supreme Court judge. Mr Haritos was obviously willing to put so much spin on anything that he was told, regardless of the facts, that it would have made Shane Warne proud.</para><para>I contend that the fiddled trust moneys should revert to the Aboriginal people through the Aboriginal benefits reserve and that Mitbul House should be vested in the ABR, where it rightly belongs. I table Justice Angel's judgment of 12 July 1999 and the plaintiff's written submissions and chronological review of trial evidence.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employee Entitlements: Bankruptcy </title><page.no>7255</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>7255</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There has recently been significant comment in the media about the issue of employee entitlements on the bankruptcy of a business—bankruptcies that are contrived or otherwise. The latest case involving loss of entitlements concerns the Oakdale miners. It is fairly well known that the Oakdale miners lost their entitlements on the bankruptcy of the mining company for which they worked. They are owed moneys approximating $6.3 million in redundancy and other entitlements.</para></talk.start><para>Today, I would like to touch on some of the issues and the particular problems in solving the matters of the just due legal entitlements of employees on bankruptcy and to suggest a possible option for resolving that particular problem. I note that, regrettably, the Oakdale miners—who were in Canberra yesterday and had a meeting with the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith—went away from this place with the matter unresolved.</para><para>Once a business is placed in receivership, there is a significant time period—it usually takes a year or two, and sometimes longer—before assets are sold to determine what moneys are left to pay entitlements. That is, of course, if any moneys are left at all. One of the particularly difficult aspects of this is that, if there is money left, employees are not paid first. The employees' entitlements will vary according to the provisions of the indus 
 trial award or agreement that they worked under.</para><para>The entitlements will also vary according to the length of service of the employee. For example, with long service leave, some employees may be entitled to a payment and others may not, depending on their length of service. The entitlements will include unpaid wages, including accrued annual leave, redundancy pay, sick leave—some awards or agreements provide for the payout of sick leave on termination, particularly in redundancy circumstances—and, finally, the employees superannuation guarantee. These payments can be made by the employer into the fund up to a year after they fall due. Often, the employee's own contributions, where an employee makes contributions, are required to be forwarded to the superannuation fund within 30 days. Unfortunately, these moneys get caught up in the bankruptcy proceedings.</para><para>As a proportion of the national wages and salaries bill paid, including superannuation, moneys lost by employees in these circumstances are fortunately a very small percentage of total wages, salaries and superannuation. However, for those employees who lose their entitlements, it adds significantly to the worry and the concern that they experience at what is a very painful period during their lives. Also in the broader community the issue has caused concern, and I think that is reflected in the widespread media coverage that employees in these difficult circumstances have received.</para><para>While stiffening the legal protections will improve the situation to some extent, particularly in the area of Corporations Law, this does not deal with the time delays that occur when bankruptcy proceedings are under way, nor does it ensure full payment of an employee's entitlements. Recently, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, announced legislation to move the payment of employee entitlements to first priority once bankruptcy proceedings are completed. However, the Liberal-National Party government appear very reluctant to introduce an effective fund to compensate employees, almost certainly, I suspect, because employers oppose such a proposal. 
 Interestingly, employers have argued that they do not want a new bureaucratic structure as they see it, nor do they want to incur any additional costs.</para><para>A number of options have been put forward for solving the problems. Firstly, I would emphasise that this issue needs a total solution, and I think the latest proposal from Minister Reith of some sort of safety net that would ensure part payment is totally unsatisfactory. Workers in these circumstances and their families are entitled to the full moneys owed. They are moneys that have been earned and they are entitled to full payment—part payment is unacceptable. It is also unacceptable that employees in general should have to pay what is an employer obligation.</para><para>Secondly, this requires national action. The solution should be national. The use of state laws and/or state based compensation funds would obviously not protect all Australian employees. It would be very difficult to legally enforce state based funds where they were introduced. For example, if a company went bankrupt and it had operations in two states, which is a common occurrence, and one state had a fund and the other did not, you would have the absurd situation where employees in one state would receive payment but those in the other would not. I also note in passing that businesses argue that this would be an impediment to investment. In reality, this would be a minimal barrier to investment, but it is argued nonetheless. So we do need national action, and this should take a number of forms.</para><para>Firstly, we need to improve the regularity of payments to employees where possible. The major problem here is in the area of superannuation. Employers are legally obliged to make payment of the superannuation guarantee, known as the SG—currently seven per cent of base wages—up to 12 months after they fall due. Employers are increasingly using this provision to delay payments. Accordingly, there are significant moneys outstanding if the business fails.</para><para>Interestingly, as a side consequence, an employee's death and disability insurance, which is part of the superannuation package, also expires after 60 days because of late 
 payment of superannuation contributions. So it is important to improve the regularity of payments where possible so that drawings on any compensation fund are minimised. This also creates a more level playing field for the vast majority of responsible employers. So my suggestion in this area is that superannuation moneys should be paid at least quarterly in order to minimise the level of superannuation moneys that are outstanding, that are owed to the superannuation fund but have not been paid.</para><para>The next area that requires improvement is the issue of legal supervision. Clearly, lifting employee payments on bankruptcy to first priority, as has been announced by Minister Hockey, should occur, but it has a number of drawbacks, as I outlined earlier. Also, legal sanctions against employers who enter contrived arrangements shifting assets to related but separate legal structures should also occur.</para><para>But I would like now to turn to what I see as the total solution of this particular problem, and that involves the concept of a national employee entitlements guarantee. The twin goals should be to guarantee timely and full payment. A number of options have been proposed in the current public debate, including creation of a special trust fund and/or insurance on employers. I do note that employers have strongly opposed such proposals on the grounds of additional costs of both the structure and the levy. They argue: why should responsible employers pay? So is there another option? I believe there is, and I would like to advance this option in the debate.</para><para>Currently, all employers are required to pay the superannuation guarantee into their employee's appropriate superannuation fund. The funds are governed by trustees, equal employer and employee, usually nominees of employer organisations and trade unions. These structures are tried, tested and trusted in terms of handling superannuation moneys. They also in the main provide compulsory death and disability insurance at a very competitive price. The sheer size of the funds enables the trustees to bargain with insurance companies in a very cost-efficient way, and the premium in this area usually amounts 
 from 80c to $1 a week that is deducted from the employer SG contributions.</para><para>I would suggest that we should be requiring a loss of entitlement insurance of superannuation trusts. The cost would be minuscule, likely to be between 20c and 40c a week, depending on the claims on the fund. When an employee loses their job, they can make an immediate claim on their superannuation fund for the moneys outstanding. Interestingly, the superannuation fund will also at the same time be pursuing superannuation payments from the employer for the employee. Usually these are not paid to the employee; they remain in the fund unless the employee is aged 55 or older and allowed to access them. So the superannuation fund is invariably involved in taking legal actions to collect outstanding superannuation moneys. Superannuation trusts with specialist lawyers are more likely to succeed legally as they have the greater resources to fund long-term legal actions than individuals do. I note in passing that indirectly this would assist government revenue as much of the recovered moneys is taxed.</para><para>How would the cost of this compulsory insurance be met? There are a number of options. The superannuation guarantee could be increased. It would be a relatively minuscule amount of money—0.1 or 0.2 per cent—to cover the cost. This would raise between $150 million and $200 million a year, if indeed that sum is necessary. The second option is to debit the existing employer contribution, which effectively passes the cost on to the employee account. I believe that this proposal should rightly not be proceeded with because the employee should not be required to effectively cover their own loss of entitlements insurance.</para><para>But there is a third area. Significantly, there is a rapidly growing amount of unclaimed and lost superannuation moneys. At last count, it was approaching the figure of $3 billion. Much of this money will never be claimed or collected. For example, when we have people visiting from overseas who are employed and they return overseas, most of those moneys will never be collected. So I would contend that some of the lost superannuation moneys 
 could be used to fund such a compulsory insurance to be paid and administered by the superannuation fund. I do also note in passing that some state governments do hold lost superannuation moneys, and they should also contribute to such a funding option. Employers may even support such a proposal. It is no additional paperwork or cost, and it may improve their appreciation of the value of the superannuation system.</para><para>I would say in closing that such a proposal could also be made retrospective for a certain time period to cover at least some of the outstanding cases that have been recently highlighted in the media. I would also note that, through its shadow industrial relations minister, Arch Bevis, and Janet Crosio, Labor has introduced a private member's bill in the House of Representatives. This legislation was introduced some 18 months ago. Regrettably, it has been delayed by the Liberal-National Party. This does also present another feasible and workable solution to what is an extremely difficult and distressing problem for workers who lose their money in these circumstances. It is an issue that should be dealt with. It should be dealt with quickly, effectively and fairly because workers and their families should not be disadvantaged in these particular circumstances.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Port Hinchinbrook Development Project</title><page.no>7257</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>7257</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to raise a matter of public interest today and to perhaps update the Senate on a long saga that has been going on in Queensland. It has nothing to do with whistleblowers this time, but it is another issue that I have pursued over many years—that is, the whole issue of Hinchinbrook. I know Senator McLucas will be interested in this because of the interest that former Senator Reynolds had in the issue. I also do so to try to protect some people who have sought to fly the flag, if you can put it that way, for the environment in North Queensland and who have suffered a lot of personal abuse and personal attacks because of that. The most outstanding person, of course, is Margaret Thorsborne, who is well known and quite famous really for the work that both she and her husband have done over many years as 
 environmentalists in that area through their own personal contributions and the other work that they have done.</para></talk.start><para>I wanted to place on the record the fact that, very sadly, the community of Cardwell is still divided over the issue of the development at Port Hinchinbrook. It is divided to such an extent that at least some of the people who are part of the Friends of Hinchinbrook group are still receiving threats, written and verbal. I visited Cardwell a week ago and again received some written material which does horrify me, but putting it on the record may give a certain amount of protection to those who are being threatened. I will not table the material because it does have some unparliamentary language contained within it, so I will perhaps make reference to the documents—at least in that way they will be given some public scrutiny.</para><para>The person who was attacked—and I will use only her first name—was a woman named Sue who lives in Cardwell and who has continued to protest against the development there. That has caused a lot of anger in the town, although of course there are people on both sides of that debate. There are those who are in favour of the resort and there are those who are against it, and I would have thought that it was the right of everyone in a democratic society to be on either side of that debate. But I do object to the tactics which are sometimes used by one side or the other and, in this case, by those who apparently support the resort development against those who continue to protest. I will read some of the material. I read from a document which begins by stating:</para><para>What a hypocritical lot of—</para><para>word deleted—</para><para>you lot are.</para><para>The document goes on to say that people have protested but that they have been using the marina boat ramp facilities. That was built as a public facility anyway, so I do not know why they should not be allowed to use it. The document abuses them for doing that. It speaks of shame on those who are still protesting and says that those on the side of the development are the majority. I might add that no-one has established that. This per 
 son—apparently a female—says she was a personal friend of Sue. Again there is more unparliamentary language, indicating that she is no longer a friend and asking them to leave town—which is the thrust of the document and where the threat is implied. Another document, obviously from the same person and in the same kind of language, made even more severe threats—one against the daughter of this person and one that these people could lose their house.</para><para>I have put this on the record because we need to know how such issues sometimes develop. When you are part of it, you feel a responsibility for those who are being attacked, no matter which side they come from. One would wish that in some way or other we could handle these controversial issues better. The appeal that some of us would make is that, rather than resorting to such threats, we ought to be able to handle the issues in a far more responsible way and recognise that, whether we agree or disagree with other people, they have a right to their opinion. I will not table the documents. I wanted to quote from them to show that the woman Sue and other Friends of Hinchinbrook are not intimidated by such documents. But certainly it does leave one wondering, if that is the kind of support you need for a development, whether there is a question mark over it. The documents were signed `Jenny and friends'. There are still some problems in that development and within the town of Cardwell over the Hinchinbrook development.</para><para>I refer to a couple of other issues surrounding the development and put it on the record that some of the debate which continues is also not very helpful. The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> published a very glowing article on the developer on 11 July this year and then later, on 18 July, published a correction in which Mr Williams was quoted as saying that his development was not for sale and he had not at any time suggested that it might be. That statement contradicts many statements made by Mr Williams, and made publicly. I will quote from a few. There was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 10 November 1994 headlined `Developer offers to sell resort', an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin </inline>of 30 June 1995 
 headlined `Williams wants to sell Port Hinchinbrook site', another article in the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post </inline>of 1 July 1995 headlined `Developer is ready to sell', and an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 1 March 1996 which reads:</para><para>I gave them—</para><para>that is, the federal government—</para><para>the opportunity to buy it at cost plus interest. He's—</para><para>that is, Mr Keating—</para><para>been advised of that several times by me verbally and in writing . . . </para><para>It is interesting to continue to follow this debate and the claims and counterclaims by both sides. I have been told that one of the casualties of war, which must include war between people over these kinds of developments, is truth. So I thought it was worth putting that correction about the claims on the record. But my main concern was to put on the record the threats which continue against those who protest at the development and in that way to bring to the attention of the Senate the conflict that continues. While one could hope that one day it will be over, it is certainly a lesson to people in this chamber—and I point the finger at myself—that in such protests one has to take responsibility for divisions which occur within the community and which seem very difficult to heal.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentary Education Office</title><page.no>7259</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>7259</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week I accompanied the Parliamentary Education Office on a tour through the Pilbara in Western Australia. The Parliamentary Education Office spent two weeks there. The first week was spent going through the western Pilbara where they visited the schools in Tom Price and Paraburdoo before going on to Karratha. They visited all the schools in the Karratha, Dampier, Wickham and Roebourne area before going to the eastern Pilbara last week. They visited Newman and provided their services in mock parliaments to all the schools in the Hedland area. I was very impressed with the way the Parliamentary Education Office worked in providing school children with an appreciation of how parliament works and how our Constitution operates.</para></talk.start><para>Today I would like to say a little about the Parliamentary Education Office and put on the record the fine work it does to promote knowledge of our parliamentary system and our Constitution among school children. The Parliamentary Education Office has a mock parliament in one of the committee rooms in Parliament House. In the past year the millionth student has passed through the mock parliament in Parliament House and that is a remarkable achievement.</para><para>The Parliamentary Education Office was established, I understand, in 1988—just over 10 years ago—with the object of increasing the awareness, understanding and appreciation of the significance of the functions and procedures of our parliamentary system. It sought to provide an information service on parliament for senators and members who wished to pass on information to people who wrote to them about how our parliament worked and also to teachers and students as well as members of the public. It has also assisted in writing curriculum material and conducting professional development courses for teachers from all over Australia. In fact, teachers come to Canberra every year on so-called parliamentary fellowships to see how the system works and they take curriculum material back to their schools all over Australia. That material is now available on the Internet. It is available very easily around this country.</para><para>I understand that during 1988 something in the order of 1,271 schools or 2,008 groups—which meant 66,921 students—participated in the program at Parliament House. Most of them came from areas close by. I understand that 54 per cent came from New South Wales, and there were high percentages from Victoria and southern Queensland, but only 3.15 per cent came from Western Australia, which is my particular area of interest. As a member of the Parliamentary Education Office advisory committee, earlier this year I expressed the view that I thought the outreach program, which the Parliamentary Education Office runs, should go to some of the more remote parts of Australia because it was highly unlikely that students in those areas would have an opportunity to come to Canberra. 
 That was the genesis of the visit to the Pilbara last week. I believe that the PEO intends to visit the Kimberley area of Western Australia next year.</para><para>The PEO does not take the outreach program just to areas which are very distant. It has taken the outreach program to areas of country Victoria, Queensland and South Australia because not all students can find the money to come to Canberra. If Mohammed cannot come to the mountain, it is a case of taking the mountain to Mohammed—or to the school children concerned. I was very impressed last week at the way the teachers brought students into the district education office in Port Hedland, which is where I was, and set up a parliament, appointing a prime minister, a speaker, a leader of the opposition and ministers. The children became totally absorbed in role-playing the respective jobs that they were given.</para><para>In addition, last week the Parliamentary Education Office went to Hedland College where it provided a mock parliament to the English as a second language class at the college. The nationalities represented in that class included Malay women, Thai women, Venezuelan women and Vietnamese women. As it happened, they were all women. Given the restrictions on their understanding of English, the Parliamentary Education Office managed to get these people to participate in a mock parliament and to do so enthusiastically. They all left with a good appreciation of how our parliamentary system works.</para><para>The other unique and important thing that the PEO did last week during its visit to the Pilbara was to visit an Aboriginal community. It went to the Yandeyarra community, which is about 120 miles out of Port Hedland. That was the first time the Parliamentary Education Office had been to a school at an Aboriginal community anywhere in Australia. Yandeyarra is a very successful community. It is a model almost of what an Aboriginal community could be, with a very nice village, a good school and a medical centre which is well set up. They have a station of about one million acres in the old coinage. As was said by one of the officers from the Parliamentary Education Office, it was like having a vast parkland 
 for these people to live in and enjoy. They also run a very successful cattle station and mining operation.</para><para>Again, I was very impressed by the way Geoff Clarke and his staff—Camilla Blunden and Ali Garnet—simply walked into this Aboriginal community and talked to the kids about something which interested them, and that was the idea that people were stealing snakes, birds and other animals from their country and what should they do about it. They all decided that it was wrong and there should be a law to prevent people stealing their snakes and birds. So a bill was set up to be passed in the mock parliament. These little Aboriginal children very enthusiastically joined in the role-playing.</para><para>I commend the Parliamentary Education Office for devising a concept which these Aboriginal children could relate to. In the other schools they had a proposal, for example, that school hours be extended, which of course most children opposed. This would not have worked so well at Yandeyarra because they do not have regular school hours: people seem to come and go as they choose. But the idea of a law where animals should not be stolen appealed very much to these Aboriginal children. I would certainly like to thank the people at the Yandeyarra school: the principal, Mark Rawlins; the teachers—Lisa Carthy and Tina McVicar—who helped set up that mock parliament; as well as the Aboriginal educational assistants, Marlene Walker and Jenny Walker, who were very helpful.</para><para>One of the objectives of the Parliamentary Education Office is to improve young Australians' understanding of our Constitution and our system of government. They are doing this through the program, Discovering Democracy. The Discovering Democracy program was established because a Constitutional Commission report in 1988 found that only 50 per cent of our population understood that we had a written constitution. A 1994 study found that 73 per cent, no less, of people over the age of 15 had a total lack of knowledge of the role of the Governor-General in our Constitution. The Parliamentary Education Office is part of the program to ensure that Australians have a better under 
 standing of our Constitution and our form of government.</para><para>One of the findings of the Turnbull committee, which looked into the question of the republic about five or six years ago, was that most Australians assumed that our Constitution was similar to the American Constitution, and were stunned to find that we did not have things like a bill of rights and so on. The need to educate Australians about our political system, our Constitution and our form of government is one of the great unmet needs in this society of ours. We should be paying more attention to educating children about our political system at a school level to overcome this huge deficiency in knowledge about how our political system works.</para><para>It is interesting that in other countries, like the United States, children have a very good understanding of how their political system works. They have a very good understanding of the history of the American Revolution, and they also have a very highly developed sense of national pride—the American flag is everywhere one goes in the United States—and that is an example that we could well emulate in Australia.</para><para>As I said, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the fine work that the Parliamentary Education Office is doing to promote knowledge of our political system and the workings of our parliament.

I made a private visit to Tibet over the winter break, and I want to make some preliminary comments about that visit and forthcoming events to do with Tibet. I can inform you that I will 
 be submitting a full report on that trip to the Senate in the next few weeks.</para></talk.start><para>The media background information, which is available to members of the Australia Tibet Council, reports that next week the third annual round of the Australia-China bilateral human rights dialogue takes place in Beijing. These private talks between bureaucrats will take place only three weeks before President Jiang Zemin of China visits Australia. China has already indicated that President Jiang is likely to announce a $15 million natural gas deal with Australia during the visit, partly because of the support that Australia has given to China in its recent confrontation with Taiwan. This is only one of several bilateral trade deals under negotiation in the lead-up to President Jiang's arrival. In this climate, the third round of the dialogue in Beijing seems certain to be at least as ineffectual as the previous meetings when it comes to confronting the serious human rights abuses taking place in Tibet and, indeed, throughout China.</para><para>The Australia Tibet Council's position is that the dialogue should be suspended pending a parliamentary review into its effectiveness. I cannot but wholeheartedly agree. The position of government in Australia regarding the military repression in Tibet is totally out of keeping with the feelings, as I have gauged them, of the people of Australia. We need to redress that. A starting point for that is increased debate in this national parliament—something that I intend to foster.</para><para>When I went to Tibet with other people at the start of August, we first went to the western city of Xining and from there bussed to Dulan, a town on the main road from Beijing to Lhasa. In doing so, we went onto the northern part of the central Tibetan plateau. This is where the World Bank intends to invest some $US40 million, backing a Chinese scheme for the resettlement of 58,000 Chinese people from the Xining area, 400 kilometres to the east, onto the plateau. This will be done by the diversion of a river, the establishment of 126 villages and the creation of a massive network of irrigation canals, which directly obstructs the passage of the nomadic Mongol and Tibetan herdspeople bringing their herds down off the mountains 
 for winter onto the plains and back again in summer.</para><para>There are a number of delegations: a media delegation last week, and the Australia China Bilateral Human Rights Dialogue delegation is being hosted to the area by the Chinese government. I think all these visits are going to fail on two counts. Firstly, none of the delegations will be taken to the wetlands—an important breeding site for the black-neck crane, which is emblematic of China and Tibet—because they are 200 kilometres out in the desert. The wetlands are going to be deprived of water by this scheme. I doubt any of the delegations are going to see the herdspeople whose lives are going to be dramatically changed by this influx of 58,000 people from elsewhere, because they are with their flocks up in the mountains at the moment. In two- or three-day visits it is simply not possible to contact those people.</para><para>There will be a lot of debate about this issue in the coming months. At least the World Bank has put its commitment on hold until there is a further study. The World Bank ought to require a minimum one-year environmental impact study and cultural and economic impact studies of that massive area to be affected on the northern Tibetan plateau before it goes ahead with that project. As well, the World Bank ought to be insisting that 58,000 poor Tibetans are put into that region—not add to the immigration problem by which China is quite deliberately moving millions of Chinese citizens into the Tibetan plateau so that the Tibetan people will be, if they are not already, a minority in their own land.</para><para>I went to Lhasa and was immediately impressed by the militarisation of that place. I cannot understand how other parliamentarians visiting the area could have come to a different conclusion. On landing at the airport in Lhasa, I saw nine fighter jets at one end of the airport, a military camp at the back and soldiers with guns placed on all four perimeters of the airport. On the way to and from the airport in Lhasa, there were passing convoys of military vehicles—some of them full of troops.</para><para>The first thing you note on the way into Lhasa is the destroyed buildings on a hillside. When you ask what happened there, you are told that that was part of the massive destruction of Tibetan culture which took place under Mao Tse Tung's government, the Cultural Revolution and the immediate predecessors of the current government—many of whom were in Beijing fostering this destruction of the Tibetan people's culture back in the sixties and seventies. In Lhasa itself there are military vehicles, but these are not gun carrying and rocket carrying vehicles, which people might look for; they are military vehicles—trucks and four-wheel drives—carrying military personnel. There are military personnel and police on the street like I have seen nowhere else in China, let alone in the free countries of the world.</para><para>It is very easy for MPs, as well as other people, to visit a place like Tibet and, not seeing people being knocked down in the streets or hearing gunshots, to think everything is toward. You have to have contact with the Tibetan people to realise the repression that is going on there. It is only safe to do that out of the vigilant watch of the military personnel and the predominantly Chinese population in the business centre of Tibet. Most of the businesses these days are owned by the Chinese. The ownership predominance has transferred from the Tibetan people to the Chinese immigrants, who have become the extension, the watching eyes, of the government.</para><para>One thing that impressed me enormously was the readiness of young Tibetans—they are the ones who tend to speak some English and, given the opportunity and reassurance that they are speaking to a friend of Tibet, will come up and start conversing with a Westerner—to express their utter wish that the Dalai Lama return to Tibet and that Tibet be given its freedom. I think that visitors who do not expose themselves to or do not find themselves in that situation have missed a connection with the Tibetan people. It is okay to be taken around by Chinese guides, to stay in Chinese hotels, to be given the Chinese tour patter, but this is very little different, in my book, from parliamentary delegations who 
 went to the USSR in the thirties, forties or the fifties and came back reporting that all was going well, that there was advancement of the people, that the economy was getting better, that production was better and that education standards were better—that all these parameters were better—while not daring to push the authorities and look behind the brutality of that regime in those times. We now all know better.</para><para>I do not believe we can shut our eyes to what is happening in Tibet. When you put your head down at night in the comfortable modern hotels—Chinese-owned hotels—in Tibet, you know that in the prisons a few blocks up the road there are monks and nuns by their hundreds who have dared to stand up for their beliefs, who are not just in prison but who are in lengthy months of solitary confinement—very often in fouled cells—and who are subject to torture, including electrified cattle prods and, unfortunately, on occasions, rape. There are harrowing accounts of extended periods of torture. I believe that no MP worth their salt should ever leave this country again and go to Tibet without speaking first to ex-prisoners from those gaols who are now part of the exiled Tibetan community here in Australia. I believe it is a failure to properly understand the plight of the Tibetans for MPs, business people and visitors at large who want to understand what is going on in Tibet to not do the study at home first.</para><para>The Australia Tibet Council has now issued a list of recommended procedures for people going to Tibet which I thoroughly endorse as a minimum for anybody who does not want to be foxed by the propaganda and the tightly controlled guiding system that the Chinese government invokes in this occupied country to our north.</para><para>Of course China wants to keep control of Tibet. It is to them `a treasure trove of forests, mineral resources and hydro-electric potential', and of course they keep vilifying the Dalai Lama and misrepresenting the position of the Tibetan government in exile. Do we have to accept that as a parameter in our negotiations with the Chinese government? The Chinese government, remember, denies all other political parties the right to exist in 
 China, let alone the Tibetan people their right to freedom of expression, or at least a minimal right to vote for self-determination as espoused by the International Commission of Jurists.</para><para>Next week, this next round of bilateral dialogue will take place with Australians, including Mr Peter Nugent from the House of Representatives, going to Beijing. I believe these dialogue talks should be, at minimum, suspended and, better still, abandoned, because they are a charade which allows the Chinese and Australian governments to put the issue of Tibet on the shelf. We go to those talks under terms dictated by China but foreign to our open, free and democratic system. Why should these talks be held in secret? Why should there be no definitive reporting? Why is it the government has such a minimal cost allocation and such a minimal delegation system for these talks? Why are non-government organisations or, indeed, representatives of groups like the Tibetan people not taken into account, let alone taken along on these visits?</para><para>I am mindful that President Jiang Zemin himself will be in this country at the start of next month.

I am very proud to remind honourable senators that the Howard government is the first Commonwealth government to have taken a national or whole of government approach to Australia's drug problem. Until the launch of the Tough on Drugs national strategy on 18 March this year and our resolute commitment of $290 million in grants under the Tough on Drugs program, Australia previously had a hotchpotch approach to this problem.</para></talk.start><para>What I am not proud of, and what I want to underscore today, is that, no matter how much money we spend on the problem of drugs within our community, unless we have a major and decisive shift in the attitude about illicit drug use in our community, all our efforts are going to be constantly put at risk and with potential lethal ramifications that most people simply are not aware of.</para><para>Let me explain what I am getting at. I will start by quoting something that Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, said in the opening of the Drug Summit on 17 May 1999. The Premier said:</para><para>Drug use is part of our society, part of our culture, part of the Australian way of life.</para><para>This is a statement that should have everyone really worried. It should set off alarm bells everywhere. I really do not think that the Premier would accept that drugs are now so inexorably and irredeemably part of Australian way of life that all we can do effectively is just fiddle at the margins. That would be a nonsense if it were the case.</para><para>But that is exactly what is likely to happen if people continue to make fine speeches and write long academic texts that differentiate 
 between hard drugs and soft drugs and when they distinguish between the use of pharmaceutical drugs and what they term recreational drugs. Think about the implications of such terminology for the type of attitude that we are fostering in our community, particularly amongst our young people.</para><para>What is a soft drug anyway? What does it mean to say that a drug is soft and what is a recreational drug? My <inline font-style="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</inline> tells me that, if something is soft, it is `gentle, smooth and calm, and produces an agreeable or pleasant sensation characterised by ease and quiet enjoyment. It involves little or no exertion or effort'. My dictionary also tells me that a recreation is `an agreeable pastime, amusement or occupation which refreshes and enlivens the human spirit and body'.</para><para>What sort of attitude are we fostering in our young people when we say that marijuana, hashish and other such types of drugs, which have such insidiously powerful effects, are gentle and smooth, and freshen and enliven the human body, mind and spirit? Although we may be able to understand how a layman like the Labor Premier in New South Wales could inadvisably refer to drug taking as part of our Australian way of life, I do not think we should show the same restraint when someone like Professor David Penington, a former Vice Chancellor and Professor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, agitates for the decriminalisation of marijuana use because it is a soft or recreational drug.</para><para>I listened to what he had to say when I attended the New South Wales drug summit in May this year, and I really could not believe my ears. Here was a leading scientist and medical practitioner who seemed to be ignoring the growing evidence of the insidious effects of marijuana because it did not suit his personal point of view. By taking this stand, he does policy makers, the community and individuals who might be tempted by so-called soft drugs a great disservice. Like so many others who trivialise the enormous risk taken by people when they get onto the slippery slope of drug taking, Professor Penington seems to choose to ignore the reality that marijuana can cause a vast array 
 of medical as well as psychiatric problems, including, in some cases, death. Most people do not usually associate marijuana usage with death, but Dr John Anderson, a consultant psychophysiologist with the Brain and Behaviour Centre in Westmead, set out just such a terminal scenario in a major policy conference last weekend.</para><para>I will reconstruct Dr Anderson's argument and will do so point by point, because it deserves our very serious consideration. Point 1: the level of THC, which is the active ingredient in marijuana, has been steadily increasing over the last few years, due partly to ongoing developments in hydroponics and the use of hormones to induce growth in plants. The level of THC in marijuana has gone from being just four per cent in the 1970s to 10 per cent, then 15 per cent and up to 30 per cent in the 1980s. Even without all the fancy equipment and growth hormones, we now have in our midst a type of marijuana called `New Guinea gold' from the highlands of Papua New Guinea which has an amazing THC level of 42 per cent.</para><para>Point 2: the higher the level of THC present in marijuana, the more profound the effect on the brain of the user. It does not just make the drug user of the 1990s a lot higher than the Woodstock hippie of the late 1960s and early 1970s; it actually retards his or her brain function. It is not just that it slows down the brain's actual growth, which continues in human beings up to the age of 27, but it does this in an exponentially more thorough way than it has ever done before.</para><para>Point 3: the solubility of marijuana, which is referred to in medical literature as its lipophyllic nature, has two extremely dangerous characteristics, which function to prevent rapid metabolism and excretion from the body. As a result, THC stays in the human system for about 30 days through cumulative use, and can now be stored for longer and longer durations.</para><para>Point 4: in conjunction with other well-documented effects of marijuana, like a reduced flow of oxygen to the brain, what happens after a period of constantly storing so much THC in the body is that people invariably start to exhibit classic symptoms of 
 depression, schizophrenia and other drug related psychoses. They invariably go to their local GP who, more often than not, puts them onto an antidepressant type of drug.</para><para>Point 5: we now come more directly to the scenario which was outlined for me by Dr Anderson and for which there is growing medical and scientific correlating evidence. Parents who find their children dead might think they had been a bit depressed for a time and might have encouraged them to go to the family doctor. Their children would have seemed happy enough once on prescribed antidepressants, but young people often do not tell the doctor that they are smoking marijuana. It is the interaction of marijuana and antidepressant drugs like prozac which can cause a deadly effect in some young people. What can result from that situation is accidental and inadvertent death.</para><para>It will be shown up that the person died of an overdose of antidepressants, and the parents would anguish about this because they would be wondering where they went wrong. Why did their child join the growing suicide statistics? But there is increasing evidence that a lot of these deaths could be caused by the interaction of these two substances and, if the level of THC in marijuana had not gone from four per cent up to as high as 42 per cent through today's usage, this sort of death might be avoided.</para><para>Let me say here that it is unlikely that many parents and doctors would have come to this realisation, as Dr Anderson explains:</para><para>Most doctors are not aware of the interaction of prescribed medications and illicit drugs. Currently there is no reference source for them to use.</para><para>Medical evidence of this correlation is now only just starting to come to light. Only last year, in 1998, there was a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Journal of Psychiatry</inline>  of someone who died because of that patient being on a lethal combination of antidepressants and marijuana. Dr Anderson has told me of similar reports from overseas.</para><para>Point 6: my final point is the appalling connection between marijuana—which people claim to be a so-called soft or recreational drug that the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</inline> tells us is gentle, smooth and refreshing to the 
 system—the classic medical symptoms which are usually alleviated by antidepressant types of medication and the tragically bizarre phenomenon of an increasing number of Australians, mostly young people, apparently committing suicide by taking an overdose of their medication.</para><para>There is nothing approaching the concept of recreation or fun in anything I have told you today—quite the opposite. There is nothing soft about the statistics on marijuana. The hard fact, as stated in the documentation that Dr Anderson has sent me, is that:</para><para>Australia has the dubious honour of the world's highest suicide rate aged 14 to 55 per capita and also the same dubious honour of being the largest consumers of cannabis in the world.</para><para>While I conclude my contribution to this debate on a very depressing note, we must face the darkness of this issue before we can walk towards the light. We have to do this so that we can rescue those who are most vulnerable in our community, and we need to do this before they settle into the increasingly deadly option of so-called soft and recreational drugs like marijuana.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>7266</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Government policy is to take all opportunities to reduce trade barriers and open markets—whether it can be achieved on a bilateral basis or on a 
 multilateral basis. What the coalition did say was that the previous government, of which Senator Cook was a member, erred in putting too much emphasis upon multilateralism at the expense of taking full opportunity under bilateral occasions as they present. In its bilaterals this government has vigorously sought—and I think Senator Cook need only refer to the record of Mr Fischer in this regard—to open markets at each and every opportunity as it has presented. Through the WTO and other venues, it has similarly sought to persuade a broadscale opening of markets. So it just requires a correct interpretation of the policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tax Reform</title><page.no>7267</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7267</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

Firstly, may I remind the Senate of the abolition of Labor's complex wholesale sales tax, which was originally formulated in the 1930s and of which Senator Sherry and the Labor Party remain among the few supporters. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax will complement the massive income tax cuts that the government is delivering to taxpayers. Of course, many families will receive tax cuts of up to $40 to $50 a week when the system becomes fully operative. These tax cuts will mean that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will have a marginal rate of 30c in the dollar or less. And it is to be remembered that many goods will not rise in price but many will fall.</para><para>Senators will be aware that during the debate there was the attempt to constantly portray that there would be massive price rises. That was quite untrue. As Senator Gibson reminded us, on 29 July, 21 days after royal assent was given to the new tax system bills, the first tax cuts began and most goods that were previously taxed at 32 per cent wholesale sales tax fell to being taxed at 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. As we know, those goods will fall to 10 per cent GST next year. These goods include clocks, TVs, cameras, watches, radios, stereo players, et cetera. These tax cuts represent the first stages of the change to the tax system in this country—changes and tax cuts that the Labor Party opposed.</para><para>Let me inform the Senate of some of the comments from retailers regarding the wholesale sales tax reductions on 29 July. I have before me the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Times</inline> from Ipswich. The headline is `Town races to grab tax bargain'.

It is worth noting that Labor opposed these tax cuts every inch of the way. In their debate Labor opposed these cuts.

Senator Allison does not even pretend to understand how the marketplace operates, let alone understand that there is always a great element of uncertainty in terms of the forward movement of share prices which are obviously significantly affected by other factors quite often beyond the control of individual companies, let alone local markets. In other words, international factors, particularly in the US, can have a very significant impact upon the ultimate share price and its trajectory. To suggest that somehow because the share price of Telstra rose as investors recognised that it had great long-term potential represents some sort of scandalous undervaluation is a preposterous proposition that can only ever be trotted out in hindsight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In other words, if the share price had gone down, we would not for a moment have Senator Allison saying, `How could they possibly have come up with that figure?' Senator Allison must be aware of the numbers that were put on the total market cap of Telstra by the other side. Over a period of three or four years it ranged from $15 billion to $20 billion. When we said $20 billion we were laughed out of town. We are now up in 
 the stratosphere compared to those earlier predictions. Those numbers are ones that were put forward in good faith by those responsible. We have no reason at all to regard the assessments made at the time as deserving of any probity inquiry.</para><para>The fact is that the concerns that Mr Fahey has addressed were ones that involved him approaching Mr Andrew Rogers before the Japanese Financial Supervisory Agency handed down its sanctions against CS First Boston on 2 August, and the chief executive of investment banking at CSFB Australia, Mr John Wylie, has made it plain on the public record that the issues examined by Japan's Financial Supervisory Agency had no impact on the Australian operations of the company, were not related to share trading and equity capital and there is no suggestion that these issues, which are peculiar to the Japanese financial market, apply anywhere outside of Japan. So in other words, it is perfectly proper for Mr Fahey, out of an abundance of caution, to have a look at what it was that led to that action being taken by the Japanese authorities. But that in no way of itself reflects upon the process that was followed in the course of T1.

You weren't one of them, I take it. You sat on your hands just hoping that the share price would dive, I suppose, so you were very keen for us to go ahead into those stormy waters.

As all senators know, Mr Skase has been the subject of serious criminal charges—company and bankruptcy charges—under Australian law since 1991. A number of warrants have been issued by Australian courts for his arrest, and those warrants remain active. The Australian government is committed to bringing him back to Australia to face these charges. Given the failure of the previous government's attempts to extradite Mr Skase from Spain in 1994, we know our best shot at bringing Mr Skase back to Australia is if he leaves Spain for one reason or another.</para></talk.start><para>I would have hoped that this is an issue on which all Australians agree. We could all pull together on this. At least in this instance, we could all be batting on the same team. We could hope that everyone at home wants to bring him home. After all, life is a confidence game. You would not want to think anyone in Australia would be giving confidence to the Skase team. However, on 20 July 1999, the <inline font-style="italic">Majorca Daily Bulletin</inline> quoted Mr Kerr—the opposition spokesman on these matters—as saying a number of things. Firstly, they quoted him as saying that `the only way Skase will finally be forced back to Australia is if new charges are laid'; secondly, that we, the Australian taxpayers, are wasting our money at the moment; and, thirdly, that `Skase will continue to run rings around the Australian authorities'.</para><para>If you want to give comfort to people who are overseas who think they can evade authorities, get yourself quoted overseas as saying that the Australian government is wasting its money and that the other side is a bit smarter than the Australian government. It is almost breathtaking, because these comments come from the man who was justice minister at the time the extradition proceedings failed. He was in government at the time. Now we can see why the then Attorney-General would not let him anywhere near the Skase matter: he would have messed it up even more than the Labor government messed it up at the time. For the people who gave Mr Skase a brand spanking new passport and who failed in the extradition proceedings to be now quoted in Spanish newspapers as saying that Mr Skase will run rings around Australian authorities is somewhat breathtaking.</para><para>Who does Mr Kerr think he is? He goes on and says that we are wasting our money. He does not seem to understand—the proceedings in Spain are between the Spanish government and Mr Skase. We are not funding these proceedings. It is just ludicrous. He does not even understand that much. As to the suggestion that new charges should be laid, Mr Skase would have to commit some new offences. You cannot charge people with something for the fun of it. New charges were laid in 1997, I think, but they related to the same criminal conduct. There can be no new extradition proceedings—Mr Lavarch, as Attorney-General, clearly understood that. We are not wasting taxpayers' money, and Mr Skase is not running rings around Australian authorities. The only upsetting thing is that we have headlines like `Chase for Skase Waste of Money' in the <inline font-style="italic">Majorca Daily Bulletin</inline>. That undermines the confidence of Spanish authorities in our determination to chase Skase, and it gives a boost to Mr Skase and to all his clan of hangers-on. My view is that Mr Beazley should bite the bullet now and sack Mr Kerr, because he does not understand his job.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Departmental Secretaries</title><page.no>7274</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7274</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

Existing Telstra shareholders are not required to pre-register, and they will have the opportunity to even further their ownership of Telstra shares.</para></talk.start><para>The important aspect of this matter is the question of accessibility. We have written 9.6 million letters to all those who are currently Telstra fixed line customers, to those who registered for the first Telstra offer and did not purchase shares and to all of the brokers' clients.

The government steadfastly ignored opposition requests to extend the deadline.

We are not like his government, fortunately; our ministers are not like the ministers in the previous Labor government. You have to look no further than the Centenary House fiasco to understand how the Labor Party rorted the public purse time and time again for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party.

I suppose Senator Conroy is going to say that about the first seven regional transaction centres that have been announced. I suppose he is going to say that they are all in coalition marginal electorates. They well could be, because they are rural transaction centres and in fact the Labor Party holds very few seats in rural Australia, and understandably so. It would be logical that most of those decisions were in electorates held by coalition members, but in fact I think three or four of the first seven are in fact in either Labor held electorates or Independent electorates.

Before I turn to the faults in that answer and the confusion in government ranks about its trade policy, let me say it is refreshing—at least I find this thing refreshing—that a minister should come into the chamber in the taking note debate and defend the government. More ministers should do that because more ministers are involved in things that are answerable in this chamber. Although I do not accept anything that Senator Ian Macdonald said, I acknowledge that at least he as a minister came forward and spoke.</para></talk.start><para>On the trade policy question, let me put on the record now a couple of facts that are 
 inconvenient for the government and which the self-styled `superb economic managers of Australia' overlook when they talk to the Australian community about their economic credentials. What is the level of foreign debt in Australia? You recall that before the last election the government ran around with a debt truck, claiming that Labor was running the foreign debt of Australia further up. In 1996, the year of that election, the level of foreign debt in Australia was $192 billion. What is it now? It is $242 billion, an increase of $50 billion or 26 per cent, and per capita the level of foreign debt in Australia is $12,500 per Australian, which is an Australian all-time record. So the government that campaigned on foreign debt has made foreign debt worse. That is the first statistic.</para><para>Let me go to the second statistic and the question of Australia's balance of trade in goods and services, our trade account. In 1996-97 we were in the black by $1.57 billion. That is the last financial year in which Labor was in government. We had a surplus in our trade account of $1.57 billion. Last year—1998-99—we had a trade deficit of $14.9 billion. There has been a turnaround of $16 billion in our trade account, not a turnaround for the better but a turnaround for the worse. This government claimed that it fireproofed the Australian economy from the Asian economic contagion. It did not; it ran our account down by $16 billion in the space of about two years. That deficit is also a record.</para><para>You have never heard that from Mr Costello. It is an inconvenient fact that Australia is not doing too well on the trade front. Therefore, when the selection of a minister to replace the outgoing Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, was made, the government turned to Mr Vaile. His debut performance was on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program with Laurie Oakes a couple of weeks ago. What did he do? He bungled his entire brief. This person does not know what he should do on trade. The day after he bungled his brief, the Prime Minister contradicted him on the lawns of the White House in Washington, saying that Australia would not use its US bases as a pawn in negotiating trade matters. The Prime Minister 
 contradicted him again by saying that Australia would not pause in its thrust of tariff reform and would not take a stance in which it said the rest of the world had to catch up. The Prime Minister said we would continue to provide the leadership for international trade reform and use that principled position to encourage the world to follow. The Prime Minister contradicted his own trade minister almost within 24 hours of that minister venturing into public comment.</para><para>One in five jobs in Australia depend on it being a nation of exporters. Twenty per cent of our economy is devoted to exports. We have an incompetent at the helm of Trade—a critical portfolio for more jobs and greater economic growth—right on the verge of the APEC conference in Auckland, New Zealand, next September and the WTO conference in Seattle, Washington, USA, in November-December this year. These are the two international events in which Australia can change the rules in APEC and the WTO to help Australia's exporters. What have we done? We have sent exactly the wrong signal to the world community. We have said, `We are renouncing leadership. We are going into regression.

Senator Cook was the one who came into this parliament in Labor's last term of government and said that the budget was in the black. What was it? It was $10 billion in the red. This is a senator who simply cannot do his sums.

That question was about the Federation Fund. He was trying to suggest that 
 some of those things were shonky. That was the word he used—`shonky'. Yet, when Senator Alston started to give examples of some of the projects that had been funded through the fund, Senator Faulkner jumped to his feet and took a spurious point of order in an effort to silence Senator Alston.</para><para>Let me go through some of the issues. Some of the fund grants that Senator Alston was talking about were: the restoration of the Great Synagogue Tower in Sydney; the restoration of one of our most important historic ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Polly Woodside</inline> in Melbourne; the development of a museum to honour the contribution of Sir John Quick in Bendigo; the restoration of the Naval Stores in Brisbane—one of that cities most important heritage buildings; support for the Balgo Hills Arts Centre in the Kimberley, which promotes the efforts of some our best indigenous artists; and the restoration of Townsend House in Adelaide, one of Australia's first schools for the deaf and blind. They are just some examples.</para><para>These projects are judged against six criteria. Those criteria are the significance, the lasting nature of it, the appropriate form for the Centenary of Federation, benefits to the broader community, good management capability, and partnerships in funding. The Labor Party, as usual, wants to deem itself irrelevant in the total operation of government in Australia. Labor senators come in here and criticise everything that is going on. The claims in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in relation to the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program continue the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>'s history of incorrectly reporting how grants are awarded.</para><para>I might add that the government is quite proud of the contribution it was able to make to the 60 projects supported by the Federation Fund through this program. Senator Faulkner has tried to criticise this—mind you, he tries to criticise everything—in terms of the announcements that were made during the election campaign. Some projects were announced during the 1998 election campaign, but what Senator Faulkner is not bright enough to realise is that this is not in breach of the caretaker conventions, which state that 
 significant decisions should not be made during the campaign. These decisions were made before the campaign period came into effect and were merely announced during the caretaker period. That is not an uncommon practice and nothing is wrong or illegal about that practice.</para><para>The problem is that the Labor Party people will not accept the rules of the game. They know exactly what they did. That is why Senator Faulkner's own colleagues said that his incompetence, his sheer stupidity, left Ros Kelly way behind. Is it any wonder? If the ALP believe that any of the 60 projects should not have received Commonwealth support then they should simply say so. They should be up front. They should tell the Australian people which projects should not have received funding. They are not game to do that. They come in here and keep referring to shonky projects. Senator Faulkner has not been able to identify even one of those. He simply smears all the projects.</para><para>Today's report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> contains a large number of errors or unjustified innuendos.

So you kicked off at about 9 o'clock, I would say, which is the normal time to clock in for the unionists.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—You wouldn't know.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—That is what they said. Deny it! Did you issue that memo, Senator Cook, when you were trade minister—let us put the story straight—that you did not want any meetings before or during breakfast when most trade ministers wrap up their day? That is when most of the work is done in other countries. That is the tradition—you get out there. But you are also known for the signing of the World Trade Agreement. The moment the ink dried on that agreement the Labor Party forgot it. You walked out from it. You slashed and burnt the tariffs in this country. You never put in place the support packages or the restructure packages—for example, in the citrus industry. I 
 remember supporting the restructure of the citrus industry when I sat on the other side of the chamber, but the great concern then—and they paid the high price—was that you never put in place the proper restructure packages to match the liberalisation of Australia's trade barriers, whereas this government has put in those support packages. For example, we will see those support packages when the deregulation of the dairy industry is put into place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point I am making is that we have a two-pronged approach—unlike you. You acted as trade minister with one policy—signing the big picture APEC agreements, the multilateral trade agreements—whereas Tim Fischer brought in the two-pronged approach. We did not deny that the multilateral agreements had their purpose, but we brought in the most important bilateral agreements. We brought a focus back to bilateral agreements. And thank goodness Tim Fischer did that in his time as trade minister, because when the Asian economic crisis came upon us and we started losing trade in that area—and APEC basically up until now has lost its oomph—we were able to rely on those bilateral agreements. We sent our trade minister out on the road to open up new markets, like Europe. In Europe alone our exports increased by some 40 per cent during the last 12 months. We opened up markets in South America that we have never had before. Did you ever go to South America? Did you ever go to India? Did you ever open up new markets in the Middle East in the live cattle trade that we had lost?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—You never did. You just went to the big forums, the APEC forums. You wasted your time in those areas. Tim Fischer as trade minister burrowed away and opened up new agreements. He got rice into Japan, opened up new beef exports into the Middle East, got live cattle trade into Taiwan, got new markets in India, and new markets in South America. You never got off your butt and went into those countries.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

This will apply to members of the Australian Defence Force who undertake combat and combat-related duties, and forms a key element of the Defence 
 Force's `No Drugs' policy. The scheme will help to ensure that members of the Defence Force will continue to discharge their duties in a safe, efficient and effective manner.</para><para>Selection for testing will be made on a random basis. Safeguards will ensure the dignity and privacy of the members to be tested, and ensure that they are notified of the testing requirements and results. Samples will be forwarded to an Australian Standards accredited laboratory for testing for illegal drugs such as Cocaine, Opiates, Cannabinoids and Amphetamines.</para><para>Commanding Officers will initiate administrative action against individuals detected using illegal drugs under this scheme. Administrative action will include an assessment by a qualified medical practitioner of the individual's fitness for further service. Other administrative action that can be taken against a member includes reduction in rank as well as posting action. However, members who are detected using illegal drugs under the scheme will not be charged under the Defence Force Discipline Act, given the range of administrative action that can be taken against them.</para><para>The second set of amendments:</para><para>enable the Chief of the Defence Force, the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, the Chief of Army and the Chief of Navy to be transferred to the Reserves, on the expiration of fixed term appointments; and</para><para>enable officers who are subject to limited-tenure promotion or management initiated early retirement to be transferred to the Reserves on the expiration of the limited-tenure promotion or relevant management initiated early retirement period.</para><para>2.</para><para>At present, these officers must as a general rule be retired at the expiration of these periods. As an alternative, the amendments will enable them to be transferred to the Reserves before the expiration of these periods, where they request this action.</para><para>These amendments will maintain access to these officers' expertise, and avoid the more cumbersome present requirement of an officer being first retired from the Defence Force and then appointed to the Reserves under separate processes.

 management initiated early retirement) to an officer not below the rank Brigadier or Commodore.

I dealt with those aspects of disability which would disqualify someone from being able to be put forward as a President of this country under the proposed legislation. The amendment is not designed to give politicians a 
 chance. It is designed to give a chance to a wider class of people, such as judges, people who are in the public service and teachers. That was really the means to open up that class of person and say, `Whilst we are deciding the question of nominations, we are not precluded from doing so simply because they happen to be a judge or in the employment of the public service.' It is not a question of getting politicians into the position of President; it is more a question of widening the choices at the time when nominations are considered.

It has been dealt with. I hope that my opposition to it will be recorded. Senator Murray was quite right when he said that it puts paid to the argument that this is an alternative which will prevent political appointments to the presidency. I simply put it this way: if there is a candidate, be they in the field of the judiciary or in politics, who is an aspirant to the presidency, they should stand down to be available for nomination to the committee and not just stand down when they know that they have gone through the process and been selected. Because of that situation, we are going to see in the future without doubt prime ministers nominating favoured members of cabinet to the presidential post and then having the people stand down both from the cabinet and from the political party. I do not think that is a good precedent. If somebody is really going to put their career on the line for this post, they should stand down before the nominations are sorted out by the Presidential Nominations Committee. That is why I opposed that last amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7297</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have great respect for Senator Brown, who has contributed much to this chamber, but it seems to me that the provision under discussion is a reasonable one. First of all, I think it is wrong for us to downplay politicians. As soon as I say that, everybody will say, `Yes, you're supporting politicians.' The thing to remember is that, by and large, politicians— 
and we have heard maiden speeches today and earlier in the week—come here with the intent of doing what is good for the country. The category of politicians, for a start, is not a category that should be condemned as such. If you look at their performance overall, they are a category that have striven to do well by this country. There are great examples of politicians in the past. The people who wrote the Constitution were, by and large, politicians. In my view, it would be wrong to make people give up a political allegiance before they had to. I can see nothing wrong with a person who is a member of a political party being appointed to the judiciary, as now happens, and then giving it up on being appointed, having been warned.</para></talk.start><para>In other words, if we take the approach suggested by Senator Brown, people would have to give up a right, an entitlement and a contribution that they were making to the community to take the position. Once appointed to the position, they should—as this requires—give up allegiances which may in fact make them biased or give them the appearance of being biased. But I do not think that, simply because a person has been a member of a political party or a member of this chamber, the other chamber or any other parliament, they should be disqualified thereby.</para><para>I come back to the issue of the way politics works and the fact that there are forces that would prevent happening what Senator Brown quite properly raises as an issue for us to discuss. It is proper for us to make sure that things are done properly and appear to be done properly. This provision enables that to be done. I do not want to see us talking ourselves down, discounting the currency, as it were. Senator Brown, for example, makes an excellent contribution to the country. He is a politician. He has done much for this nation, and so have many others here. So I make the points that the term `politician' should not be a derogatory term, that there are political forces that operate to ensure that whoever is appointed is a good appointment—in a democracy, people are subject to elections, which are every three years in this case—and that there are protections in the 
 political process of an open society where everything is patent and out in the public arena, where there is accountability and where that accountability is impressed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>7298</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move amendment No. 5 on sheet 1472 revised:</para></talk.start><para>(5)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (line 12), at the end of the paragraph, add:</para><para>		 ; (iii)	 the person must not have held office as President for more than one term of office.</para><para>As the clerk rightly points out on the running sheet, amendment No. 5 can coexist with the government amendment just passed. This amendment adds a stricture to the tenure of a President and therefore disqualifies any President who has reached the appropriate tenure term from being put up as President again. In the background of this amendment is an issue which probably needs a brief airing and needs to be noted for the record. That is the issue as to whether a member of the executive—which, whether a President is independent or not, he or she is, because they have executive authority—should have open-ended and unlimited tenure at the discretion of the Prime Minister of the day. To my reading of the proposal, that appears to be the case.</para><para>As we know, the tenure of parliamentarians is restricted by the process of regular elections which are set out in law. We know the tenure of the judiciary is restricted by age. There are very few situations where tenure is not properly confined and expressed. It is my view that it would not diminish the office or in any way harm the concept of a President—in fact, it would improve it—if their term were limited. However, this is not a recommendation from the Constitutional Convention. I do not think it is a recommendation from the committee. I merely express this as something about which we should be concerned as yet another flaw in this model.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>7298</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this. It was not something which came from the convention model, as Senator Murray has mentioned. Furthermore, it was not a matter that the joint com

I do not believe they need be consequential; they just have to be two terms in total. The government's view is that this could prevent a very popular President from commencing a third term, and that option should be available. It could also prevent a removed President being chosen again as President if that President had exceeded the limit concerned. It basically limits the flexibility of this. Flexibility is something that was commented on by the joint committee. I do not think there is anything to be had by limiting the terms of a President.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>7298</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is quite the contrary; it increases the flexibility for the people of Australia. If we cannot provide a different President every 10 years out of the 18 million to 30 million Australians in the next 30 to 50 years, we are something short of flexible. I agree with this amendment. I think 10 years as a term for a President is a maximum. I am also very well aware of the way in which these terms can be potentially altered so that a real limitation is put on the turnover and the variety of presidents and on the input of the Australian people. The fact that this has not come through the Constitutional Convention should not worry the government. It has not found itself restricted in this legislation by recommendations from the Constitutional Convention or anybody else. It has taken it as a guide, and that is it. The fact that Senator Murray has come in with an extremely good suggestion should not discount it from being taken up. It is a good suggestion, and I support it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7298</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition does not support this amendment, essentially for the same reasons as the government.

On balance, it opted to fix the term at five years, saying that the office would fall vacant. It is preferable, the government believes, that that not be adopted. Under the proposed changes, a new President 
 could be chosen in advance of the end of the incumbent's term so as to allow a seamless transition. The process might, for one reason or another, be delayed.

For a President to serve successive terms he or she would have to undergo the same nomination processes with all the other prospective candidates.

It is important that, even though we are using the title President, everybody understands that the President we talk about here is entirely—I use the word advisedly—different from the President that occupies the White House in Washington. It is important to keep that distinction alive.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7302</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again I find myself agreeing with Senator Murray. The Greens worldwide have had long debates about rotation, that is, limitation of the terms of elected representatives. At one stage in Germany they closed it down to a two-year term. They found that was not such a wise idea because it did not give the incumbents time to really get used to office before they were facing the door out. That, of course, is a limitation that is too extreme. To use in reverse the argument that Senator Cooney has just been putting, the Americans with an elected President moved to change their constitution to limit the elected President to two terms. Here we have got a non-elected President, because the direct election option is not being given to the people of Australia, and we are saying that we should not limit that to two terms. I do not go along with that. I think that Presidents will certainly have varying degrees of popularity and some of them are going to be extremely popular, but that is not to say that at any given time in this nation there will not be a range of other extraordinarily accomplished and potentially very popular people as well.</para></talk.start><para>I think the office of President is going to be one that will be greatly honoured by its incumbents and I think it is in the interests of the nation that at least every 10 years we allow another citizen to take that high office. To not do so is to move in the direction of stultification. By the way, as with the United States, those Presidents who have served their five- or 10-year term in office are going to be part of the group of elder statespeople, if you like, of the nation. They will continue to have their influence and they will continue to be honoured. But I think the moving aside once a decade for a new face is an extremely healthy thing, and I support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>7302</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes this amendment on grounds previously outlined. I would agree with the comments made by Senators Bolkus and Cooney. I might point out that the committee in its report at page 37 stated:</para></talk.start><para>The Committee accepts that there are good policy reasons for permitting a person to serve more than one term as President. It also notes that the process set out in the Republic Bill for the selection and appointment of the President involves a number of steps and requires input from a number of persons and bodies. It therefore considers that, in order to ensure that the best candidate is ultimately appointed, the process should incorporate maximum flexibility.</para><para>What we have here is a situation where the President serves a term and would then have to be reappointed through the appointment process. That is a safeguard against any situation where there might be just a rubber-stamping of the return of the President. That President would have to go through a process and would succeed only if he or she had bipartisan support. Leaving it open-ended does not pose any risk, because of that requirement of appointment at the conclusion of each term.</para><para>Furthermore, the question of flexibility arises, and this does allow flexibility. It does not say that after a period of time you are not eligible to return to office or to run again for that office. If the people want you, they can have you. A comparison to the United States President I do not think is really appropriate, because we are dealing with two very different creatures, if you like. The President who is being envisaged for Australia is not one who has the same powers or manner of election as the President of the United States. They are very different roles indeed. This is a role for Australia where the people of Australia might want to have someone there for three terms. If they do not, that person would not be reappointed. The community opinion would be gauged by the Prime Minister of the day and the Leader of the Opposition. For those reasons, the government opposes this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>7302</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The people of Australia are not empowered to vote for the President. Let us get this straight. We are here dealing with a system where the ultimate appointment is by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition; it is a political appointment. The big parties might live to rue the day they turned down this sensible amendment. After two terms, if they 
 want to change the President and do not select a renominating President, it is going to be seen as a political act extraordinaire to remove the President, effectively, and put someone else in place. I would have thought that this is a very sensible move. I do not think it has been well thought out by the big parties. I think it is in their interests.</para></talk.start><para>The last argument that can be resorted to here is that the Australian people will at some stage or other want to have the President kept in office because she or he is popular. I reiterate that that is not going to be their prerogative. That option is not what we are dealing with. We are dealing with a system where ultimately the Prime Minister puts forward the nomination and has to get the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition. I think under those circumstances it is even more important that we have some end of tenure so that there is a smooth and politics minimised—it cannot ever be politics free—turnover of Presidents at least once a decade.

It is one that we would have liked to have seen accepted by the government. It does not really add a great deal. It adds the words `as soon as practicable after the removal but in any event not later than 30 days'. At the moment there is a requirement that there has to be report back to parliament no later than 30 days. We thought it was important to try and make that as soon as practicable after the removal and not have the Prime Minister or the government wait for 30 days. However, it would seem as if the government is not prepared to pick this amendment up, and as a consequence we do not see any real value in pursuing it. As I say, it fits in the category of a minor amendment and not one that really affects the structure of things in a great way.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7303</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(R2)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 4 to 16), omit section 62, substitute:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">62  Removal of President</inline></para><para>	 The Prime Minister may, by instrument signed by the Prime Minister, remove the President on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, with effect immediately.</para><para>	 A Prime Minister who removes a President must, within thirty days after the removal, seek the approval for the removal of the President of two-thirds of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in a joint sitting, unless:</para><para>			 (i)	 within that period, the House of Representatives expires or is dissolved; or</para><para>			 (ii)	 before the removal, the House of Representatives had expired or been dissolved, but a general election of members of that House had not taken place.</para><para>	 The failure of a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal of the President does not operate to reinstate the President who was removed.</para><para>It gives me great pleasure to move this amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats. That is because we believe it seeks to restore the Senate to its rightful role in the dismissal process and to give protection to the President in an Australian republic.</para><para>The amendment before the chamber offers similar protection to a President as is currently afforded federal judges under section 72 (ii) of the Constitution. The President of an Australian republic would otherwise be placed in the invidious position of being able to be dismissed by the Prime Minister without a stated cause. Much was made of this issue at the 1998 Constitutional Convention—as I said in my address to the Senate last night—and of the need to balance the powers of the Prime Minister and the President. The Democrats have concluded that the power is very much weighted in favour of the Prime Minister. It is not only our opposition that supports this analysis, it is the view of a number of prominent witnesses before the select committee; that is, the balance is tipped too far in favour of the Prime Minister, potentially undermining and undervaluing the role of an Australian President.</para><para>The Democrats are conscious of the safeguards that are in this model which the committee sought to strengthen in some ways. But we do not believe that the requirement, that a Prime Minister who dismisses the President must seek the ratification of a majority of the House of Representatives within 30 days, is an adequate protection against a politically motivated or peremptory dismissal. It would be highly unlikely—and I would be very surprised if anyone in this chamber would suggest this—that a Prime Minister of the day could not command a majority vote in the House of Representatives. The Democrats believe that the lower house alone would merely act as a rubber stamp to the actions of the Prime Minister of the day.</para><para>So we think it is appropriate that the Senate be included in this process of ratification. That is a view which we have held for a long time. That is a view which we sought to have incorporated into this original model during the Constitutional Convention proceedings. Obviously, we were not successful. We recognise that the intent of these bills is to reflect as much as possible the communique, the outcome and the model that was voted on at the Constitutional Convention and so we acknowledge that this is a diversion from the model. But we think it is an appropriate diversion.</para><para>We are aware of comments from witnesses who gave evidence to the select committee that, in fact, they think perhaps a minority of delegates at the Constitutional Convention—this is perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, and I do not know if it is a bit presumptuous—would these days support a role for the Senate in that dismissal process. So we view that divergence—or diversion, if you like—as disappointing and unfortunate but we do believe that this model has undermined the role of the Senate as an equally representative and sovereign house of the parliament. We also believe that this undermines the security of the tenure enjoyed by a President. We are very keen, through this amendment, not only to elevate the Senate to its rightful place but to ensure a degree of protection and security for an Australian President.</para><para>As I have mentioned previously, we also seek to ensure that grounds for dismissal—that is, that a President can only be dismissed for proven incapacity or misbehaviour—be incorporated into this legislation, as well as the support of a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the federal parliament. We believe, and I have stated this a number of times in the last couple of days, that the Australian President will be a unique figure, a symbolic head of state—a constitutional empire—and that we should not seek to undermine or undervalue in any way these important qualities.</para><para>If the Senate is left out of the dismissal process, we would be doing that. Similarly, if we fail to give appropriate constitutional protection to an Australian head of state or afford the security that we give to, say, Federal Court judges, the importance of that office will be underestimated and potentially undervalued. So we think there are natural justice principles as well as other important principles in relation to democracy and the role of the two houses of parliament. That is what we seek to do through the Democrat amendment to this legislation. I do hope, especially because we are debating this in the Senate chamber, that government and opposition senators will respect their office—and the chamber in which we all work and legislate—and consider supporting the Democrats in this endeavour.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Bartlett)</name></talker><para>—I would just clarify, Senator, that you have moved amendment No. 2 on revised sheet 1474.

It means a substantial shift in the balance of power 
 from where it is now and basically has deep-seated implications for our constitutional system. Basically, the Democrats would like the approval of a two-thirds majority, not just of the House of Representatives; they want a joint sitting. They want to ensure that the Senate has power in the process as well. That does, in a sense, provide for the buttressing of a President who may be keen to take on a Prime Minister and a government. But you just cannot read this amendment on sheet 1474 in isolation from the rest of the Australian Constitution to which the words of this amendment are sought to be added.</para><para>Basically, under the Constitution, we have the powers of the current Governor-General, reserve powers and the like, and in a sense those powers would also be buttressed by the impact of this particular amendment. As the Constitutional Convention did, we see this sort of proposal as leading very quickly to a substantial shift in the power balance. Like the ConCon and the government, the opposition is keen to ensure that we do not move from a position of a ceremonial head of state—President or Governor-General—to a situation where the President might have powers buttressed by a Senate which is more keen to cause political havoc than it is interested in the ordinary affairs and transitions of government.

There is the Democrat one that Senator Stott Despoja is putting forward, there is an amendment from Senator Murray and then there is the Australian Greens amendment, which I have put forward. All of them involve the Senate in the dismissal process. So it should be. The Senate is involved in the appointment of the President through the requirement for a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of both houses. The Senate should be involved in a dismissal, should that unhappy event come to reality.</para></talk.start><para>Cloaked in what we are hearing yet again from the government and the opposition is the wish to concentrate powers ostensibly in the representatives, but that sheets it right home 
 to power, in particular, in the office of the Prime Minister and in the office of the Leader of the Opposition. They already have an extraordinarily powerful position in the process of appointment of the President. I think it is extraordinarily important that there be a whole-of-parliament approach to the dismissal of the President. I will support each of these proposals, but it worries me greatly that the Labor Party is not going to.</para><para>I think the people of Australia would want us to support it as well, just as the people of Australia support very strongly the retention of the Senate and the powers of the Senate. I cannot help but think that the big parties are very happy to have the Senate involved in the two-thirds vote for the appointment of a President because it gives some validity to the naked reality—which is that, in the main, it is going to be left to the offices of Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition to make that appointment.</para><para>When it gets to the dis-appointment of the President—the dismissal of the President—they do not need that cloak of respectability of involving the Senate anymore, so the process is to knock it out. Senator Stott Despoja is right. The Senate should be involved in both the appointment and a dismissal if it occurs. One of these three formulas should be used. They involve either a joint sitting with a two-thirds majority, as in Senator Stott Despoja's amendment, which is the same as the appointment process, or the houses separately coming to the conclusion that, due to misbehaviour or incapacity, a President ought to be removed from office.</para><para>Unfortunately, there is the need for a dismissal process. There is not the need for the power to be concentrated at that time in the hands of the two offices of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I support this motion. If this fails, I will be supporting the one from Senator Murray and, if that does not succeed, I will, of course, be supporting my own motion on behalf of the Australian Greens.</para><para>I also say to the opposition and to the pro-republican members of the coalition that, by not adopting one of these alternatives which involves the two houses of parliament approv 
 ing the dismissal of a President, you will make the campaign that much more vulnerable. This is its most vulnerable point. The Prime Minister made that clear the other night. He is already onto it. He made a road with potholes in it and his job now, as a monarchist and an opponent of this nation becoming a republic, is to try and make those potholes appear as deep as possible. I have criticised him before for his role in the process.</para><para>I say to the Labor opposition that this is the biggest pothole of the lot. If the campaign were not to succeed because of concentration on this dismissal process, be that on your heads. I think you are wrong. The Senate should be involved if Australia finds itself in the terrible situation of having to dismiss a President. It is as simple as that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>7306</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understand what Senator Brown is saying. He is saying that, as the debate about the republic is presently situated, what is in this amendment is something that the Australian people would find attractive. However, when we are arguing the issue of the constitutional framework in which the country is going to go ahead, we really have to look at what is going to give good government that will be properly scrutinised and kept in check by a parliament. As Senator Stott Despoja said, this President is a symbolic figure with, as Senator Murray said, some—but really very little—executive powers. It is a model that is quite distinct from the situation in the United States of America. This particular amendment is based on the concept that the President-to-be in Australia would be like an American President. It would not.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Stott Despoja said that we have provisions to protect judges. But that is a different issue, because judges are people who make decisions which have far-reaching consequences for governments and other people who come before them. They must have tenure of position because they are making decisions which clearly are going to be unpopular—at least with one side—and they are going to make decisions between states, between the Commonwealth and the states and between other people. It is funda 
 mental to the proper democratic functions of government that judges be secure.</para><para>To use Senator Stott Despoja's words, a symbolic figure is not in that position; a symbolic figure is there to personify the good things about the country. The executive power, whether we like it or not, is with the Prime Minister. Yet the argument goes forward on the basis that somehow that is wrong—it is all right for a President to have executive powers but not for a Prime Minister. That really is an argument to change the whole system of government under which we now operate—to change what is called the Westminster system into the system that operates in America. And we cannot have that concept going around without a lot more debate than we presently have had.</para><para>We argue about the effect of what is called the lack of security for the President, but it has to be looked at in the general framework of the balancing of powers. Under section 59 of this bill, the President has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, which was done in 1975 and caused at that time all sorts of consequences and all sorts of problems. So we must decide as a nation where we are going to repose our power. The United States says it should be with the President; we say it should be with the Prime Minister, subject to all the consequences. The Prime Minister will be appointed or otherwise, depending upon the numbers in the House of Representatives. That is a matter of reality.</para><para>If we raise the status of the President above what will give a proper balancing of powers within the community then we have some trouble. That point has been made again and again. I speak now in respect of the amendment put forward by Senator Stott Despoja. Why go through all that trouble, when this appears in the amendment, at least on the sheet that I have? It finishes off:</para><para>The failure of a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal of the President does not operate to reinstate the President who was removed.</para><para>So we go through all this crisis for no outcome of any consequence. If the Prime Minister seeks to dismiss the President under 
 the scheme put forward here by Senator Stott Despoja, what is to stop the Senate and the House of Representatives talking about that and criticising the government about that as it is? So to a certain extent this amendment attacks a straw figure—raises an issue which seems to give the House of Representatives and the Senate power but in the end does not, because the amendment finishes up by saying that the failure of the two-thirds majority to come to a conclusion that the Prime Minister is wrong does not in any way negative what he in fact has done.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>7307</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Many people think that the fate of this referendum will rest on the question. I personally think that the fate of the referendum will also rest on the failure of the Labor Party to accept one of these three amendments: that put by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats, which I fully endorse and support; that put as a variant on that by me; or that put by Senator Brown. I say that because there are three main groups of people opposed to this referendum question: the first group are monarchists, the second are direct electionists, and the third are those republicans who will support an appointed model but find this model fatally flawed.</para></talk.start><para>Right at the heart of the fatal flaw is this issue that unfair dismissal is possible for the President—that there is no role for the Senate in that matter. Right at the heart of Senator Cooney's response is this very dangerous and scary scenario whereby we are attempting to move to reinforce an elective dictatorship. The separation of powers concept requires that the President or the Governor-General be as independent as they can be from the executive. If you put the President into the status of a junior minister, subject to  unfair dismissal, it is the Prime Minister in this country who has supreme and absolute power. And that is not a wise thing.</para><para>The Americans understood this problem and they took the President out of the parliament. The parliament is distinct and separate from the executive—and should be. The British—they are a cunning lot, the British—had the Crown, which was distinct and outside of 
 parliament, so the Crown devised matters so that elected representatives would have allegiance to the Crown, but always at least there was sufficient separation of powers to protect the people from an over-mighty executive. That is the thing that direct electionists fear more than anything. That is a thing which monarchists fear—an over-mighty executive. And when you allow this Constitutional Convention model to go through you are giving greater and greater power to the Prime Minister, whoever the Prime Minister might be in the future—and none of us in this place can foresee that.</para><para>That is why I say that this question lies at the heart of the possible failure of this referendum and the very real gamble the Labor Party is taking on this matter. If it were not for this dismissal issue, supporters of the appointed model who find the model fatally flawed might be with you and might get it over the line. When the Leader of the Labor Party, the very experienced Kim Beazley—from my state of Western Australia—puts his weight and authority behind this, if this referendum goes down I think it will cause some difficulties for the Labor Party.</para><para>In my judgment, this decision is a very material one. People try to tell us, `This is merely replacing the existing system.' It does not, because at the moment there is a third party involved in the dismissal of the Governor-General, and that is the Crown. There has never been a dismissal of a Governor-General, so we do not know how the Crown would behave in that instance. We can take a very informed and intelligent view based on likely precedent, but we do not actually know. Conceive a position where 49 per cent of the House of Representatives petitioned the Crown not to accept the removal of a Governor-General because it was done wrongly by an overmighty Prime Minister. Conceive the same position whereby maybe two-thirds of the Senate also petitioned the Crown on the same basis. I could not imagine that the Crown would not hesitate over accepting the advice of an overmighty Prime Minister to dismiss the Governor-General.</para><para>It is that sense of uncertainty, that sense that the Crown is ultimately there as a protec 
 tive mechanism for our constitutional system, which has helped give us stability and certainty over 100 years of Australian nationhood. That is why the monarchists support it. That is why the direct electionists have common cause with the monarchists. They want that protection. This model takes away that protection, and it is a fearful thing. That is why somebody like me, if these amendments go down, will oppose the referendum.</para><para>I cannot support enough the concepts here. Section 62 creates an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister. There are no stated grounds for dismissal and no mandatory parliamentary oversight. Look at the protection that Senator Stott Despoja's amendment provides. Firstly, the removal of the President is determined on known grounds which are used constitutionally with respect to the judiciary. Secondly, the Senate is involved, and we have used the same mechanism of the joint sitting.</para><para>The other points have been well made by previous speakers. If the parliament is to be good enough to appoint the President, the parliament is good enough to oversee the dismissal. The parliament is the representative of the people, not the executive. I cannot stress strongly enough that I think this is the watershed moment for this bill and the prospects of the referendum going up or down. That is why, Senator Cooney, the government will oppose this amendment. They know that this is the linchpin which will guarantee the referendum failing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>7308</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that, Senator Murray. You say at the moment there is a separation of power. If you read the Constitution in terms of its black-letter law, that is hardly the situation. Section 1 of chapter I of the Constitution states:</para></talk.start><para>The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called "The Parliament," or "The Parliament of the Commonwealth."</para><para>Section 61 of chapter 2 states:</para><para>The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative,

So she has legislative power to that extent. She also has full executive power under section 61. They are the terms of the Constitution.</para><para>If you look at it in those terms, you could hardly say that that mixture of powers, which has operated over the last hundred years, has brought about dictatorship. But what is going to happen under the new regime is that the Governor-General, as he is now, who would become President and take over the functions, is going to have a much sturdier base on which to stand because of the way he is to be elected. I say that because section 2 of the Constitution reads:</para><para>A Governor-General appointed by the Queen—</para><para>who, as I said, has a legislative and executive function—</para><para>shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.</para><para>She has power both legislatively and executively. The Governor-General can be dismissed at the Queen's pleasure. She has to act, as I understand the constitutional position, on the advice of the government of the day. You talk about dictatorship of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is in effect elected by a majority of the House of Representatives and represents the House of Representatives. Who elects the members of the House of Representatives? The people who elect the members of the House of Representatives are the people of Australia.</para><para>Every three years the Prime Minister is subject to that sort of check.

 become, will be more secure under the new scheme than the old.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—That is rubbish.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Murray, can you explain to me what sections 1, 2 and 61 of the Constitution mean if they do not mean that there is a very strong connection in the Constitution between the executive power and the legislative power of the Commonwealth vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor-General?

Senator Cooney would know, because of the warmth of our relationship, that the shouting of `That is rubbish' was not aggressively intended.</para></talk.start><para>I will simply encapsulate it in this manner. The proposal says that the Prime Minister can dismiss the President out of hand, immediately. He will give that President a letter and at that instant that person is dismissed. It is an immediate, one-to-one transaction. Of course, I understand what the Constitution says about the present relationships between the various sectors of the executive, but right now if the Prime Minister attempted to dismiss Governor-General William Deane he would have to ask the Queen of Australia's permission. There is no `instant' about it. She could take a day, a week, a month, a year. There is no time frame in the Constitution which specifies that she must act immediately. We have no knowledge, no experience, no precedent of how the Crown would react if there was a hotly disputed dismissal.</para><para>I accept absolutely, Senator Cooney, that if the Prime Minister said, `This particular Governor-General unfortunately has a terminal illness which has affected their capacity to perform the job. They will not go. I must dismiss him or her,' the Crown would no doubt be extremely helpful in resolving the matter. But we have no precedent or understanding of how it would be dealt with if it was hotly disputed. The particular point is that there is no immediacy about it.</para><para>That is what the Labor Party fears. That time delay was what enabled the Governor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister. That is as it should be because a dismissed Prime Minister can go back to the people but a dismissed Governor-General or President cannot. That is the simple answer. That is why I responded in the way I did. I am sorry if it was slightly offensive. It was not intended so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>7309</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No offence was taken, Senator Murray. People have been trying to struggle through this. No matter what position you take in this debate, everyone seems to have agreed that the Prime Minister is going to be the head of the executive. This particular amendment continues the position of 1975 whereby the Prime Minister can be dismissed by the President, as he or she will be. In my view, that is one of the great issues in Australian history. Those of us who were there at the time still suffer some shock from what happened in that period—or at least I do.</para></talk.start><para>Instead of concentrating on the elected government, people are talking about a symbolic figure—namely, the Governor-General, as he is now, or the President, as he or she is to become. To me, it is a topsy turvy argument. It is all right to dismiss an elected government, but it is not all right to subject a Governor-General or a President to any force because he or she cannot be re-elected. He or she can be appointed again—there is no doubt about that.</para><para>The whole argument seems to be that the elected parliament, the government and the Prime Minister have a taint of evil about them and are not competent or able to carry out the duties they should, whereas the President will, by taking on that office, be sanctified in some way and therefore worthier and carry more weight, even though he or she is only a symbolic figure, than the executive which we hope will run this country.</para><para>In 1975 Australia was in near chaos. It was the steadiness of the people of Australia and the steadiness of the government that kept us going. To now say that somehow a symbolic figure, the President, with very limited executive power, should be elevated above the 
 system and that what we are proposing to do here will make us closer to a dictatorship than under the present Constitution is not right. Senator Murray, you have put forward some powerful arguments, as you always do. I simply say that I do not think those arguments, if acted upon, would get the result we wanted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>7310</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not intend to speak for long.

I just want to put forward arguments that have already been put forward against the very great power the Prime Minister has in this particular area of the dismissal of the President.</para></talk.start><para>There are a couple of things that need to be said, however. Senator Cooney mentioned the symbolic office of President. Yes, it is symbolic but the President also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister. I think the situation was outlined very cogently by Senator Murray whereby under the current Constitution the Governor-General would have a window of opportunity to dismiss the Prime Minister. Again, the Prime Minister could appeal to the people, as was stated by Senator Murray, whereas the new President could not if the legislation is put forward unamended.</para><para>I think this is a very important issue to a lot of  people. I do appeal to the Senate to ensure that the Senate has its rightful place. After all, the appointment of the President is not by the Prime Minister; the appointment of the President is by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament sitting together. If that is a method of appointment, why is that not also the method of dismissal? Furthermore, should we remove the Senate, the second chamber, from this process all together? The second chamber is a house of review, but it is also the chamber where the interests of the state are protected and promoted. Isn't it interesting that under the referendum legislation a referendum can only be passed if a 
 majority of people vote for the question in a majority of the states? Yet when you come to the question of the dismissal of the President the second chamber of parliament has no role at all. I do not think that is going to go down too well in places like Tasmania, for example.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">STOTT DESPOJA</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—Or South Australia.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Or South Australia, as indicated by Senator Stott Despoja.

But at least I would appeal to this chamber to consider this matter very carefully indeed. I know you have, but you need to ask yourselves the question: is it appropriate to remove this chamber altogether from the process of dismissal when it has a clear mandate in the legislation to be involved in the appointment procedures? I offer that for what it is worth. I will not continue at great length because it looks as though things are a fait accompli, but I do appeal to those on the government side and those on the opposition side to give consideration to this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7310</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Harradine has been reiterating quite clearly the point of view that the Greens and the Democrats are taking here. This is a sidelining of the Senate by the big parties. 
 Senator Cooney said a little earlier that, in effect, the presidency would be largely ceremonial. But behind this—the big parties getting together to block the Senate from being involved in the dismissal of a President—is the theory that, in some way or other, a President who is under some sort of suspicion or who is facing potential dismissal or real dismissal by a Prime Minister is going to go to the Senate to try to have that decision by the Prime Minister overruled. You cannot have it both ways, Senator Cooney. You cannot say, on the one hand, that this is a ceremonial post, in which case that would not matter, and, on the other hand, that the Senate ought not be involved because it can in some way or other thwart the wishes of the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start><para>Both houses of parliament are involved in the appointment of the President. Both houses of parliament ought to be involved in the dismissal of the President. This makes the positive outcome of this referendum most vulnerable. The Labor Party will be responsible if it goes down, because of the argument that will be raised on this very point. I have told Mr Turnbull of the Republican Movement in no uncertain terms that his movement, the ARM, should be behind these amendments, because this does make the yes case vulnerable. But there has been an apparent failure there; there has certainly been no public support coming from the ARM on this.</para><para>I have made it clear, moreover—I share the home state of Tasmania with Senator Harradine—that the Greens will be pivotal in the campaign down there, not least Christine Milne, former leader of the Greens in the parliament, who was a delegate to the convention. I said, `Mr Turnbull, if you want the Greens to be in full flight in support of this positive outcome in the pivotal state of Tasmania, remembering that you do require a majority of votes in a majority of states, then make sure that the Senate is involved in the dismissal process as well as the appointment process.' I have not heard a word since then. I might add that we are going to shortly get to the need for a consequent convention, with the people involved, and I hope that we 
 will be getting more support there from the Labor Party.</para><para>The Labor Party are making a big mistake in not supporting any of the options which would involve the Senate as a safeguard in a process of dismissal of the President by a Prime Minister. It is the major mistake that the Labor Party are making in this process, and they cannot escape responsibility. If they were to support this and, indeed, if the Australian Republican Movement, the ARM, were doing its job on this, we would be getting a different result here and we would be much more assured of a positive result on 6 November. It is a real lapse by the Labor Party. I cannot help thinking that it is because of this feeling that the Senate ought to be sidelined. That is not what the people of Australia think.</para><para>It is all the more important that the Senate be involved here, because the option of an elected President is not on the table. We are talking about an appointed President, appointed by the two big political parties, by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, then getting the stamp of approval from a two-thirds majority of both houses. When the reverse process occurs—and that is when you have a crisis in politics—it is all the more important that the two houses of parliament are then involved. That is why the Greens have put up the option of having a majority of each house of parliament. It is in the Constitution, it has been there for 100 years—fortunately it has never had to be used—in the case of High Court judges misbehaving or being incapacitated. It should be the same for a future President. It is a necessary, commonsense safeguard and it ought to be supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7311</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to respond to some of the comments made about the amendment that I have moved. Firstly, I will not be holding only the Labor Party to account on this matter; I do not think the Labor Party is the only party culpable in this chamber. Clearly, the government—both the members of the National Party and the Liberal Party—had the opportunity to show their support for the houses of parliament by supporting the amendments before us.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is important to put on the record that this is a changed position from at least one political party in this chamber, that in fact the previous models advocated by the Australian Republican Movement and the Republic Advisory Committee, which was established under the Keating government, allowed for the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process. So this is actually a changed position. At the Constitutional Convention I moved comparable amendments to these to include the Senate in the dismissal process; I was not successful. The numbers in the Senate and the indications from party representatives today suggest that again I will not be successful.</para><para>This represents a changed position from not only the ALP but also one of our foremost republican advocacy groups, the Republican Movement. That saddens me, because I am a patron of the South Australian Republican Movement, but they are aware of my differing views on this issue.</para><para>To respond belatedly to Senator Cooney on a couple of points, I agree with him on one point. I cannot argue for the superiority of the current system, perhaps unlike my colleague. I am not going to defend the status quo—I do not wish to. I think the model being proposed and some of the safeguards incorporated into this legislation in relation to the dismissal process are an improvement on the current system. For that reason, as many people know, I will be supporting this referendum. But I do not like supporting legislation that has some defects and that is flawed. Here is a perfect opportunity, with the amendments I move on behalf of my party today, to rectify that particular problem.</para><para>In relation to Senator Cooney's comments on the Australian head of state being symbolic, I am aware that I used that word, but I have also pointed out repeatedly that an Australian head of state under an Australian republic would be in a unique position of power. Not only would they perform the role of a symbolic and constitutional head of state but they would also be a constitutional umpire. That has been pointed out by Senator Murray, Senator Brown and Senator Harradine.</para><para>That brings me to the other part contained in these amendments on the issue of security of tenure and on the rights as well as the responsibilities of the President. We support the comments made by committee witnesses such as Mr Williams regarding the impact that uncertain tenure would have on the independence and the status of the President. We know the evidence presented to the committee strongly argued that the independence and status of judges, for example, had evolved from their security of tenure. That is why the Australian Democrats are equally anxious that the independence and the status of an Australian head of state be fostered and protected as much as possible. There are worthy comparisons between the role of judges as legal and judicial umpires, if you like, and that of an Australian head of state.</para><para>I come to Senator Cooney's last point—a good point—in his first contribution in this debate. Senator Cooney, I hope I do not misrepresent you on this. You looked at the amendments and noted that a vote by that total number of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal would not reinstate the President. You would be aware, I hope, that this simply reflects the current provisions of the proposal. That wording is the same wording used in the proposal before us, which is supported by both the government and by Labor. This was something I grappled with at the Constitutional Convention. Was that issue of natural justice a dilemma? Is it a problem that, even if the President were dismissed and that ratification were not approved, that person would still lose their job? That is something that I have grappled with, but I think your bringing that up supports the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process. I hope I do not misrepresent Professor Zines, but I think his arguments also bolstered the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process simply because it provided further disincentive for the Prime Minister to embark on such a course of action unless he or she ensured that he or she would be supported, but supported by a majority and a more representative and diverse group.</para><para>Senator Andrew Murray likes to refer to this dismissal process as an `unfair dismissal'. 
 In many respects, he is right. The Australian republic's President would have the dubious honour of being the only public official in this country not entitled to rely on natural justice principles in the event of a move to dismiss that person, and the term `unfair dismissal' comes to mind. Not only would he or she not have the opportunity to hear or answer reasons for the dismissal but half the body responsible for the appointment of that person would have no say in that dismissal process.</para><para>Finally, Senator Bolkus said initially that this changed the balance of power. He used the term `gridlock' again in his argument—a point that was picked up by one of the witnesses to the joint select committee, Professor Galligan, who said:</para><para>All the more reason—</para><para>to involve the Senate—</para><para>because if it is that sort of stand-off between the houses, why give the whistle to one house?</para><para>There is a change in the balance of power. This proposal not only entrenches the primacy of the House of Representatives but also—as we have seen in earlier debates and unsuccessful amendments—entrenches the power of the bipolar political system, or the old two-party system, and the power of not only the Leader of the Opposition but the Prime Minister. We seek to move away from that. We seek to restore the Senate to its rightful place in this process. For that reason, I urge honourable senators to consider the amendment before them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7313</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank my good friends Senator Harradine, Senator Murray and Senator Stott Despoja for what they have said. But Senator Stott Despoja said that the only person who would be subject to an unfair dismissal if this goes through would be the President. That is not quite right because the Prime Minister would be too, under this. I want to take up that balance. Given the power that the Prime Minister has and the sorts of functions that he or she is going to perform and given the power that the President will have if this goes through and the functions and power he or she will perform, who is more likely to want to get rid of the other? I would suggest it is 
 the President, because the President—beyond his or her power of dismissal—has very little power. The main thing is that he or she is a symbolic figure. The Prime Minister is the sort of person whom, as history has shown, a Governor-General or President might get rid of. As you say, there is no precedent so far for a Governor-General having been dismissed. There is a precedent for a Prime Minister having been dismissed. In the whole of this, that is to be remembered.</para></talk.start><para>The last point that I want to make is this: you talk about the House of Representatives moving without the Senate, but of course the Prime Minister is made by the House of Representatives without the Senate. If you want a balance between the President and the Prime Minister, that is to be remembered. The Prime Minister is both made and unmade in the House of Representatives. It is true enough that, under this system, the President will be made in both houses. However, the fact that the House of Representatives will unmake him or her is not as bad as may first be thought, when you realise that the Prime Minister is subject to the same sort of process—except that, in the case of the President, two-thirds of the parliament has to dismiss him or her whereas, in the case of the Prime Minister, 50 per cent plus one can get rid of him or her.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7313</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's position is that it does not agree with this amendment. This amendment shares some similarity with two other amendments that are to be moved. In this instance, the Democrat amendment provides for the Prime Minister to remove the President on the ground of proven misbehaviour or incapacity. A similar sentiment is expressed in relation to the Greens amendment. The government finds that this is perhaps both legalistic and vague. The question is one of how you judge misbehaviour. Is it justiciable?</para></talk.start><para>In the United States, we have seen the conduct of a President come under scrutiny and there have been all sorts of conjectures as to whether that has constituted misbehaviour. There does seem to be something of a subjective aspect in the whole matter. There is of 
 course the involvement of the Senate and there has been much debate about that. The government has taken the view that this was not a matter which was contained in the convention model. Indeed, there was no recommendation by the committee that there be any dismissal, or removal of this sort, of the President by the Prime Minister. I refer to page 73 of the joint committee's report:</para><para>The Committee notes that the draft legislation substantially implements the dismissal model recommended by the Constitutional Convention.</para><para>I have just referred to that. It was, after all, an undertaking by this government to carry out the model as recommended by the Convention. The committee went on to state:</para><para>The Committee is not persuaded that any of the alternative dismissal mechanisms suggested was better than that contained in the Republic Bill. In particular, the Committee considers that the proposed `quasi-judicial' dismissal procedure, which is appropriate in relation to a judicial officer who must be independent of Parliament, would not be appropriate in respect of the President, who would be part of the executive arm of government. Furthermore, the Committee feels that most of the alternative dismissal mechanisms put forward would probably, in practice, be extremely difficult to satisfy.</para><para>I think that really sums up the position. For those two very strong reasons—that this is not contained in the convention model or one put forward by the committee—the government does not accept or agree to this amendment. In any event, there are aspects of both this amendment and the other—perhaps I am debating it cognately, but I think that is wise in view of the constraints we have on time—that approve misbehaviour, and that is something which I have said is perhaps both legalistic and vague at the same time. For that reason, the government is not persuaded to agree to the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>7314</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is for the very reason of the presumption that the President will be part of the executive arm of government that this amendment needs supporting.</para></talk.start><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

The second addition was that the President may address a house before that house votes on the resolution to remove the President from office, again a second natural justice safeguard, if you like. That is the key difference between that and the earlier amendment put, but I think we have had the debate and I will take the vote straightaway, if the committee so wishes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator ELLISON</inline> (Western Australia—Special Minister of State) (6.02 p.m.) The

This Australian Greens formulation would mean that the removal of a President would require the same process as is currently in the Constitution—and has been for 100 years—for the removal of a High Court judge who either misbehaves or becomes incapable, and that is that each house of parliament would have to vote to approve of that dismissal in the same period of the sitting of parliament. This formulation is taken, as I said, from the Constitution. Fortunately, it has never been used for a High Court judge. I hope it does not have to be used for a President in the future, but it does give a check on the executive. It does mean that the parliament which appoints the President is also involved in the dismissal. We have had the debate; we are not going to succeed with it, but let that not diminish the importance of this amendment. It is crucial, as far as the Greens are concerned, to this legislation.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7315</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(5)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 14 to 16), omit the third paragraph of section 62, substitute:</para><para>	 The failure of the House of Representatives to approve the removal of the President shall be

It would mean a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister if the Prime Minister failed to get a vote in the House of Representatives within 30 days of that removal. This is an amendment to ensure that the Prime Minister does not ever undertake the dismissal of a President too lightly and knows that, if they were not to succeed in a House of Representatives vote, which Prime Ministers ought to be able to command, they in turn would be dismissed and the matter would be put to the people in an election. That would be the effective outcome of this amendment. It is a backstop amendment. It does not get over the problem of the Senate not being involved in a dismissal, but it does add some very important gravity to the actions of a Prime Minister and may have a sobering effect at least on a Prime Minister who is not giving due weight to the seriousness of an act to dismiss a President.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>7316</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I withdraw amendment No. 9 on sheet 1472 revised.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>7316</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has indicated that opposition amendment No. 5 can be dealt with by ordinary legislation.

It holds faith with the Constitutional Convention itself. It is a crucial amendment from the Constitutional Convention to ensure that a further convention would be held, two-thirds elected by the people of Australia, within three to five years after the convention last year and after the establishment of the republic. I might add that without this recommendation going forward the Constitutional Convention would not have succeeded in the outcome of recommending the republic in the way that it did. There were critical votes in that convention which depended on this further convention to look at the whole of the Constitution, to involve all of the Australian people and to look at sections of the Constitution not just restricted to the presidency, with a view to improving the Constitution as we move into the 21st century. I am moving this amendment in good faith from that convention. It is extraordinarily important that it be supported. It is an act of faith with those people who were disappointed with the options coming out of the convention.</para><para>The amendment opens up with a definitive type of time line preceded by an information and education program and then an information seeking program from the Australian people for further review of the Constitution. 
 It would be an act of bad faith for this not to become part of this legislation. It is not good enough to leave it to some other political mechanism; we need it built in as part of this legislation. To not do so is to not keep faith with those members of the convention who expected this as an outcome and went along with the outcome of the convention with this as a condition. So it is a very important amendment.</para><para>It would enable, for example, the review of the Constitution, taking into account delegates from all across Australia, on such matters as the roles of the Commonwealth, state and local governments. I particularly note there local government, which is currently left out of the Constitution. Another matter is the rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship. There has been a lot of talk of a bill of rights in this country. The United States has one and many other countries do; we do not. Another matter is the need for the Commonwealth to have the power to make laws with respect to the environment. This is crucially important for the majority of Australians, particularly in a situation in which the reverse is happening, where the Commonwealth is devolving laws away from itself regarding the environment at the moment.</para><para>It would look at the electoral system, in particular predicated on the notion of one person, one vote, one value in this country. Other matters are methods of altering the Constitution, constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation, the equal representation of men and women in parliament and options for enhanced involvement of the people in the processes of governance—that is, to improve democracy. These are very important matters, and I think it is incumbent as an act of faith that the government and the opposition support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>7317</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment.

We have long favoured broad ranging constitutional changes. An Australian head of state and the move towards a republic is just one of those changes. Senator Brown has referred to everything from a bill of rights to the roles and rights of the states to the republican issue and reconciliation.

For instance, the concept of delegates being elected by the people of Australia voting as one electorate throws in a snag which, once again, would imperil the chances of the main question being successful. If you are telling the people of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia that they will come at the end of the list of all other people when voting for delegates to this convention, you will minimise your chances in those states. They will recognise that there is no way that their combined population would match the popula 
 tions of New South Wales and Victoria. So, Senator Brown, there are some matters of a technical nature that need to be canvassed. I do suggest you pursue this as a motion in the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7318</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not support this amendment. I might say at the outset that the Prime Minister's commitment to put the model to a referendum did not extend to the convention's proposals for other changes which are not necessary to implement a republic. Of course, the convention resolved that, if a republican system of government were introduced, the government should convene a further Constitutional Convention. This question, the government believes, is best addressed in the event that Australia does vote to become a republic. A further Constitutional Convention, in that case, would be one option that the government would consider as it looked for practical means of progressing the public debate on important constitutional issues.</para></talk.start><para>The government does note that the joint committee did take the view that further community discussion on constitutional reform would be beneficial. I think the government would not take issue with that. However, it does not see its way clear to support the inclusion in this legislation of a further convention. It was just pointed out to me that a former French monarch, apparently Napoleon III, said he would be baptised by a referendum but would not live with his feet in it. That is a good point, because here we are looking at future change and future engagement with the people of Australia, which can be done by policy and not by an amendment of this sort which is casting it in concrete.</para><para>Through the chair to Senator Brown: we are not breaching faith at all.

But when it gets to the opportunity—moved by delegate Tim Costello, if I remember correctly, and seconded by Christine Milne—that the Constitutional Convention felt so strongly about,  that there ought to be further consultation with the Australian people, suddenly it is reverse gear. It is the same with the Labor Party. Senator Bolkus gets up and says, `Chair, there are technical difficulties with this.' Why aren't those technical difficulties being dealt with by the Labor Party right here and now so that this amendment can be got through? That is a cop-out.</para></talk.start><para>The ALP, by the way, supported a motion to this effect put forward by Senator Margetts when we were dealing with referendum legislation back in March this year. But what happens time and time again with the big parties is that, when they get to the point of keeping faith—with having to consult with the Australian people and give a bit of power back to the electorate—faith is breached, and this is a breach of faith. Those people who were at the convention will know it is.</para><para>We would not be sitting here tonight debating this matter had this commitment not been made, through the convention, that a further convention would be held further down the line to resolve so many issues which that Constitutional Convention wanted to deal with but could not. `Yes, Senator Brown can move a motion in the Senate,' says Senator Bolkus. `Leave it to us. Trust us. Trust the big political parties.' Well, I am saying that if you have trust in the people, if you are going to give faith to the people, you would be supporting this amendment and you would have overcome the technical difficulties that you see in it.</para><para>In not supporting this amendment, Labor and the coalition are welshing on the Constitutional Convention outcome. It is welshing on the good faith that the delegates expressed at that time to get a resolution, part of which was this pivotal commitment to the establishment of a further Constitutional Convention. No wonder people lose faith in politics. No wonder people lose faith in the big parties. As 
 the government has done today, you just use the outcome of the Constitutional Convention when it suits you but you turn your back on it when it involves people getting a further hearing down the line. Why? Because the big parties want to keep that power to themselves; they want to restrict it to themselves. They do not want to be tied down by any commitment to a gathering of the people which was not totally under their control, much as that effect was attempted. This is a shameful outcome. It is a breach of faith. Again, it must make people wonder about the health of the big parties and the respect that they have for the people when they can break an agreement coming from a convention as important as this one.

This matter was brought up during the course of the hearing before the joint committee. I will refer to that part of the evidence which is relevant. On page 83 of the committee report, in referring to the previous amendment, the committee stated:</para><para>. . . the main objection was that the substitution of the term `Australian citizen' for `subject of the Queen' effectively narrows the scope of s.117 in its present form. Mr Jeremy Buxton—</para><para>who was from Western Australia—</para><para>stated that the</para><para>amendment apparently fails to recognise those `subjects of the Queen' who enjoy such rights of citizenship as voting in State and Commonwealth elections but who are not formally Australian citizens. These people will presumably lose the protection of s.117 that they currently have through this amendment.</para><para>I might just recap from there. Section 117 of the Constitution currently precludes a subject of the Queen, resident in any state, being subjected to any disability or discrimination in another state that is not equally applicable to a subject of the Queen resident in that other state. The republic bill would substitute `Australian citizen' as the most equivalent expression for `subject of the Queen' in section 117. The term `Australian citizen', although an appropriate replacement expression, arguably has a slightly narrower meaning than `subject of the Queen' in the Australian context. I hark back to the evidence given by Mr Jeremy Buxton in that regard. The government would maintain that the conversion to a republic should not remove rights already accrued to individuals under section 117 of the Constitution.</para><para>The amendment that is being proposed, therefore, would alter schedule 2 to ensure that the bill does not remove any right accrued under section 117 at the time of the conversion to a republic. This issue was addressed by the joint committee in recommendation 13, which recommended:</para><para>. . . that the Republic Bill be amended so that no person who currently enjoys the protection from discrimination on the basis of residence afforded by s.117 of the Constitution would be deprived of that protection as a result of the amendment to s.117 proposed in the Republic Bill.</para><para>I believe that this is an appropriate amendment. It is technical in nature. It is something that was not specifically considered by the Convention but, certainly from the spirit of the discussions at the Convention, I do not think delegates thought that in the transition to a republic any Australian should lose any rights thereby.

</para><para>This relates to the amendment of the Australia Acts. In relation to this, the government would submit that section 7 of the Australia Acts should be amended as part of any move to a republic to rule out any argument that it entrenches Crown links at a state level. This can be done either following a request from all states or by constitutional amendment. The republic bill as introduced included a fall-back provision which would have facilitated the amendment of the Australia Acts by the Commonwealth parliament.</para><para>However, all states have passed legislation requesting the Commonwealth parliament to amend the Australia Acts if the republic bill is approved at the referendum. With that in mind the amendment removes that fall-back provision from the republic bill. This proposal honours the government's commitment to the states on the preferred procedure for amendment of the Australia Acts. The states had preferred that the amendment be done at the behest of a request from all the states, and that has now been done. Therefore, this fall-back provision is of no consequence. I would submit to this chamber that this is an appropriate amendment, one which has the support of the states and goes to the efficacy of the legislation and the transitional arrangements to a republic if it is voted for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>7321</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The proposal is technical in nature and is supported by the opposition.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that clause 7 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7321</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are now dealing with a new amendment which has recently been circulated.

This is an amendment of a technical nature. Proposed clause 8, schedule 3, provides that the constitutional conventions in relation to the reserve powers are able to continue to evolve. This amendment will 
 make it completely clear that any other constitutional conventions will also be able to continue to evolve. These other conventions may deal with issues such as who advises the President in particular circumstances. This amendment will therefore simply confirm what the government believes to be the case: that any constitutional conventions in relation to the non-reserve powers will continue, and that these conventions will be able to evolve. This amendment will deal with the issues raised by the committee in its recommendations 8, 9 and 10. This amendment will make opposition amendments (1) and (6) unnecessary. I might just refer to recommendations 8, 9 and 10 of the joint committee. Recommendation 8 stated:</para><para>The Committee recommends that consideration be given to amending the Republic Bill to state that the conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice for the Governor-General apply in respect of the President.</para><para>Recommendation 9 then goes on to state:</para><para>The Committee recommends that, if Recommendation 8 is accepted, consideration be given to making specific provision in the Republic Bill to maintain the capacity of the conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice to evolve.</para><para>So those conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice will continue to not only exist but also evolve. Recommendation 10 states:</para><para>The Committee recommends that cl.8 of proposed Schedule 2 of the Republic Bill be amended to provide for the continuing evolution of all constitutional conventions, including those not associated with the reserve powers.</para><para>What we have is the continuation of the evolution of constitutional conventions, which is the case at the moment. They are evolving over time. They are in existence. This is a proposition which the government believes will maintain as much as possible the status quo in relation to these conventions. The government does not believe that this is inconsistent with the convention. It is certainly in accordance with the three recommendations that I have mentioned which were put forward by the joint committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7322</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This amendment does what opposition

The government believes that this is an important amendment. The traditional view is that the reserve powers and 
 the conventions which govern their exercise are high political matters which are not justiciable. That view, however, has been questioned. Proposed section 59 of the Constitution is not intended to resolve the existing uncertainty. It has been designed to leave things as they are while keeping faith with the convention model and ruling out any argument that the reserve powers or conventions are lost with the removal of the Crown. This could be clearer, however. Clause 8A has been added to rule out any argument that the enactment of proposed section 59 of the Constitution would, in articulating a requirement that the reserve powers are to be exercised in accordance with the constitutional conventions, make the exercise of a reserve power by the President justiciable.</para><para>Clause 8A is intended to ensure that the changes made by the bill do not of themselves make justiciable the exercise of a reserve power that was not justiciable when exercised by the Governor-General.

It does not pass my notice that the current Constitution, in which we rely on the blessing of the Almighty, is very different to the wording of the preamble which has come up today, which puts hope in God. Goodness gracious, isn't it better to leave reference to 
 God out of the preamble than to descend from relying on God to hope in God?</para><para>I believe in a secular society like ours that it would be better if the first phrase in the proposed government and Democrat preamble were removed, and I will so move at the appropriate time tomorrow. I also underscore and highlight the difference between the preamble that I am putting forward and that which was released today, in so far as recognising indigenous Australians. The preamble released today does not have the strength and validity that the words in my proposal have, those words being `recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land'. How important those words are. How much stronger they are than the preamble today, which says:</para><para>honouring Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the nation's first people, for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures which enrich the life of our country . . .</para><para>That falls very short of recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of all our land. For those two reasons, I believe the preamble that I have moved to have adopted is better and stronger. It better represents the feelings of Australians. Maybe it would be worth the Democrats reconsidering this matter overnight, in particular with regard to the strength of recognition of indigenous Australians which is in the preamble that I am proposing here.</para><para>I will wait to hear what Senator Bolkus has to say. I think the timetable we have is much less important than getting the better resolution and that we stand by the better proposal, which I put forward on behalf of the Australian Greens but which I have no difficulty in attributing to the Labor Party and Gareth Evans and, more particularly, the hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians who, over the last couple of years, contributed to it through the process of gathering opinion on how they thought the preamble to the Constitution should be worded.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>7324</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I understood that the preamble bill is being debated tomorrow.

I think it is important to speak to some of the things that have been said by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is really indicating that he wants God out of the Constitution effectively. Senator Brown is moving a preamble which relegates God to history. If you analyse what is before you, that is precisely what this does. He mentioned the word `God' but he relegates God to history, because his preamble says:</para></talk.start><para>Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Common 
 wealth of Australia being now a sovereign democracy . . . </para><para>He is referring to a historical event in 1901 when, he says, those people who came together relied on God—nothing to do with what we now should be doing. I think people looking at this particular proposal by Senator Brown should realise, as he I think admits, that he wishes to have God effectively taken out of the Constitution. We could discuss the matter but let us be very clear about it and not hide it by using the word `God'. He is actually using the words `relying on God' to refer to a historical coming together in 1901.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Is leave granted for Senator Brown to withdraw his amendment?</para></talk.start><para>Amendment—by leave—withdrawn.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now turn back to page 1 of the bill and the title. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>7325</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Title, page 1 (lines 11 to 16), omit the title, substitute "A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President".</para><para>The committee now turns its attention to the central element of the <inline ref="s841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999</inline> , which we as parliamentarians know as the `long title' but which the Australian people will become familiar with as the actual wording of the question on their ballot papers on Saturday, 6 November this year. As such, the set of words which is now before the committee will become the public face of the referendum. The Australian public understands very well just how important it is that these words accurately and fairly reflect the fundamental issues being put to the vote at the referendum.</para><para>For any holder of office in the Commonwealth government to propose a referendum question which is inaccurate or biased would, in my view, be committing a considerable disservice to the Australian people and to the Australian Constitution itself. The Labor Party believes that that is a very reasonable descrip 
 tion of the Howard government's actions in relation to the wording of the question to be put before the people later this year. The Labor Party will continue to stand up for proper constitutional reform in this nation, including the fundamentally accurate and unbiased wording of referendum questions. It is for this reason that I have moved this amendment on behalf of the opposition.</para><para>As I indicated in my speech at the second reading stage, Labor prefers the long title recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. The committee's brief description of the outcome of the referendum process was an accurate and a very well formed description. It is a long title born of compromise on an all-party committee representing all sides of the republican debate. It is unquestionably the fairest and most accurate description of the change that Australians are being asked to vote on. First, it says what we all accept; that is, if the referendum is passed, then Australia will become a republic.</para><para>Secondly, it provides a brief description of the type of republic that we will become. It says that the President will replace the Queen and the Governor-General. We believe that this is important because it distinguishes the type of republic proposed for Australia—if you like, a Westminster system republic where executive government is responsible to parliament, as opposed to the United States style of executive presidency. The committee's and Labor's version of the question focuses on the powers of the President—an issue that we believe is more important than the process by which the President is chosen.</para><para>Finally, it makes it clear that the President must be an Australian. As we know, the Queen is not an Australian; the Governor-General need not be an Australian. These are the reasons that we prefer the long title recommended by the committee. We are keen to see whether anyone in this place, particularly those who are proposing alternative questions, is able to explain to the chamber why they believe the Labor Party's amendment is in any way inaccurate or biased.</para><para>I turn to the preferred version of the long title that is being sponsored and supported by 
 the Australian Democrats, to what we understand will be the proposed long title of the Democrats. We were told during the Prime Minister's press conference this morning that the Democrats were not successful in changing the government's mind on this particular question. I have got to say that it seems to me that the Democrats did not fight very hard for their preferred option, and I think that does throw a little bit of doubt on perhaps their willingness to follow through with their stated agenda. I made what I believe were some generous comments in my speech at the second reading stage in relation to the Democrats' approach—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—That was out of character!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I would have thought that it was in character, Senator Evans. But you are entitled to your opinion, which I doubt would be shared by many. I think I mentioned that, although we do not think that the Democrats' proposed form of the question is as good as the all-party select committee's version, we did indicate that we believe that the long title proposed by the Democrats is reasonable. I understand that the Democrats' preferred long title was considered by the joint select committee and was an alternative compromise to the one that was actually adopted by the committee. While it is not as good as the one ultimately recommended—because it only provides the briefest description of the outcome of the process; namely, that Australia becomes a republic—we believe it is accurate. It is not misleading. I do not think a reasonable person can say that it is weighted in favour of either side of the debate on this important issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I turn to the government's proposed version of the long title and the question because, in its present form, that long title is unacceptable. It is clearly biased in favour of the monarchist cause. It neglects to state that the President will be an Australian, which is an essential feature of the republican model that would result from the successful vote of the referendum. It describes only part of the selection process—naturally, the most unpopular part of the selection process—without describing the participation of Australians in the process.</para><para>This has been done to deliberately and cynically bolster the monarchist argument that this model will see the President chosen by politicians. This is rather ironical, given that our current Constitution vests the choice of Governor-General in the most partisan of all political figures—that is, the Prime Minister. Similarly, the current referendum proposal has built-in safeguards, again relying on the institution of the parliament, in relation to the termination of a President's term. Under the current system, as Gough Whitlam has noted on a number of occasions since 1975, there are no safeguards regarding the termination of a Governor-General's commission. As we all know, the necessity of having the Queen herself withdraw a commission is no effective safeguard at all. The Australian Constitution requires the monarch to act on the advice of her ministers.</para><para>The opposition has not seen or heard anything which can change our view that the Howard government's referendum question, in either the original form or the amended form, does not accurately or fairly reflect the proposed constitutional alteration. In this way, the government's proposal fails the basic fairness and accuracy tests for any referendum question. The inaccuracy and bias have been deliberately pursued by the Howard government with a clear objective in mind, and I mentioned this last night. The government understands implicitly that, in any form of polling, manipulation of the framing of the question is a sure-fire way to manipulate the end result.</para><para>Madam Temporary Chair, you would recall the AC Nielsen poll earlier this week which offered concrete proof of the scope to dictate an end result. When the government's question was put to respondents, the question was lost. But when the joint committee's question was put to the sample group—that is, the same question that we are moving via this particular amendment today—there was a resounding win for the proposal. I have no doubt that the government's internal polling has told them exactly the same thing. We have a situation where the Prime Minister has probably snowed the genuinely republican members of his own frontbench and his own 
 party room. He has dudded genuine republicans throughout Australia in the framing of the referendum questions. I believe a poll like the AC Nielsen poll has outed the Prime Minister on this issue. I would urge members of the coalition in the Senate, and perhaps I should include the Australian Democrats in this—they are emerging coalition partners; I think that is a fair thing to say—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—At least we're not the fourth faction of the ALP!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I would urge the coalition parties to consider the results of the Nielsen poll and the very clear message it contains about the motives and manipulations of Prime Minister John Howard.

It is a compromise that is fair to all. In my view, to give in to the tactics of the Prime Minister would be absolutely unacceptable. Further compromise would mean giving in to the Prime Minister's tactics and the tactics of his monarchist supporters. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, has often spoken of his own passion for the republic. I reckon that is a passion that is a feature of the Labor Party as a whole. It reflects the view of the significant majority of Australians. We also passionately believe all Australians deserve to be presented with a fair and accurate referendum question. We are committed to ensuring that a proper choice is put before the people, and I would urge all senators to support the amended long title that I have moved on behalf of the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7327</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Greens are also moving an identical amendment.

If you are not going to support the Labor amendment and the Greens amendment then, as you of course have your own, you can tell us how good that is. We do not want to be victims of a charade here. We do not want to be taken down the garden path by the Democrats and then be told, `Oh, we were not really serious. The Prime Minister does not like it. Therefore we will not persist 
 with it.' The Prime Minister has not liked quite a number of things about this process, all the way through. He did not in fact like having the process. He is obviously no republican.</para><para>What we have at this stage of the debate is a Prime Minister who is saying to us, `Either take what I want or take nothing at all.' We should make him blink. The Senate should stand up and say, `Prime Minister, your proposal is not fair. It is not balanced against fairness in outcome in this debate.' But we do not want to be led by the Democrats, who in one sense I suppose, if you look at the statements over the last 24 hours, have graduated from being fairies at the bottom of the garden to developing their own child-care centre down there when it comes to negotiations.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—Ha, ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Senator Murray, you may laugh but, if you are serious about your proposal, do not tell us that you are going to be serious about it for 24 hours.

We also need you to know that on a number of occasions so far he has said, `No, this is not on'—but he has had to move in the interests of fairness and in response to public reaction. He looks very much like a spoiler when he says, `You will take what I give you and nothing else.' He has said that consistently through this debate; he says it again now. But what should be motivating you, as Democrats, and also the whole chamber, is how we get a fair and balanced question, and how we persist with it. As I said, the messages were somewhat mixed last night as to how serious the Democrats were in respect of their amendment. For instance, we are not going to be victims of a charade, if we have to support second best, and find ourselves supporting the Democrat amendment and then being told by the Democrats, `Well, the Prime Minister has said all or nothing and he may defer the referendum.' This issue is not the plaything of this Prime Minister, and that is a view that the public has expressed time after time in reaction to the way that he has played this debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>7329</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

By all accounts he was a remarkable person with a great capacity for giving and caring, and a strong love of life. He was the sort of person who holds a community together and makes it strong and good. Now, unfortunately, he has been lost to us. On Tuesday, 3 August at 11.45 a.m., Sergeant Glen Huitson was shot by a gunman in a cowardly attack while manning a roadblock on the Stuart Highway. He died in Royal Darwin Hospital approximately an hour after the shooting and is survived by his wife, Lisa, and their two children, Joseph, aged 2, and Ruby, aged six months.</para></talk.start><para>Sergeant Huitson was based at Adelaide River, a small and important community on the Stuart Highway, approximately 100 kilometres from Darwin. He had served in Alice Springs, Nauiyu Nambiyu and other communities throughout the Northern Territory, and was respected as a good cop who looked after people in his community with a gentle but firm hand. Sergeant Huitson was at the forefront of active policing with all its rewards and dangers. He was given a full police funeral on Saturday morning at St Mary's Cathedral in Darwin. As a mark of recognition and respect, over 2,000 people—family, friends, fellow officers and the general public—attended the funeral of this most well-known and loved man.</para><para>For such a fine young man to have died in such a senseless attack is an absolute tragedy which now impacts so cruelly on his family, colleagues and the community. Sergeant Huitson had everything in life to live for, but he gave his life for the community of the Northern Territory doing his duty as a police officer. He was a brave man. In February of 
 this year, without drawing his gun and with no lives being lost, Sergeant Huitson disarmed a drug-crazed gunman who had hijacked a tourist bus. His medal of valour for this extraordinary act of heroism was presented at his funeral to his widow, Lisa, by the Police Commissioner in a most moving ceremony.</para><para>This tragic event has shocked the people of the Northern Territory to the core. It has made many reflect on the sacrifices that our police make in the interests of the public good and the risks they are called on to face courageously in carrying out their duty. This young officer and his family have made the ultimate sacrifice for the community. Sergeant Huitson was an exceptional police officer with an outstanding career to date and so much to look forward to. Most importantly, he was a husband, a father, a son, a brother and a friend to so many. His great loss is shared by the whole Northern Territory community. He will be missed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Funding for Smoking Prevention Programs</title><title>Huitson, Sergeant Glen</title><page.no>7329</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7329</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak tonight about smoking, heart disease and, in particular, the Northern Territory government's lack of commitment to funding prevention programs. Two weeks ago the Heart Foundation, when celebrating its 40th birthday, praised the generosity of the Australian people, whose donations have greatly assisted the foundation in its mission of reducing heart disease in our community. The research carried out by the Heart Foundation provides important information which can be used in the fight against heart disease, and this information is often most powerfully channelled through the medium of television and video.</para></talk.start><para>Three months ago, during National Heart Week, I had the pleasure of attending the launch of a video called <inline font-style="italic">Listen to your heart</inline>. This short video, produced by the Heart Foundation in Darwin, tackles the very serious level of heart disease in Australia's indigenous community. The video with its simple messages and humour, using boxer James Swan as a role model, was impressive, 
 and I congratulate both the Heart Foundation and those who were involved in producing the video on the results of their efforts. The aim of the video is to promote the reduction of lifestyle factors which increase the risk of heart disease and to encourage people to give up smoking, to adopt healthy eating patterns and to get more exercise. The distribution of this video to Aboriginal communities will be a small but important step in the effort to reduce heart disease in our indigenous communities.</para><para>At its launch, the video was introduced by the Director of the Northern Territory Heart Foundation, Dr Chris Burns. Dr Burns told the assembled crowd that heart disease and stroke had reached epidemic proportions in Australia's indigenous community. In this context, he acknowledged that the video was a small but important contribution towards reducing heart disease amongst indigenous people. He also talked about the higher prevalence of juvenile smoking in the Northern Territory and pointed to the alarming differences between national and Territory rates of heart disease. The rate of heart disease in the Northern Territory is 1½ times the national average. But the facts on indigenous heart disease rates are particularly frightening. Indigenous Australians between the ages of 25 and 64 have seven to nine times greater risk of death from heart disease and stroke than other Australians. Unfortunately, around 40 per cent of all heart attacks and strokes cannot be fully explained by the risk factors we already know about, so some aspects of heart disease are still puzzling medical scientists.</para><para>However, the message that came through from both Dr Burns and the video was loud and clear: when it comes to heart disease, prevention is better than cure. Some people might see this as a tired old cliche, a fact that is so blindingly obvious that it is barely worth wasting breath on. We believe that people have long since got the message—but perhaps not. Dr Burns went on to share some more statistics about rates of heart disease in the Territory and in Australia's indigenous community which might seem even more shocking than the ones I have already mentioned. Most people now know that smoking increas 
 es the risk of several serious health conditions, including heart disease. The real message is getting people to stop as well as preventing young Australians from starting to smoke in the first place. This involves putting in place a range of programs which deter young people from starting to smoke and different strategies aimed at helping people to quit the habit.</para><para>Governments in all states have recognised this by committing funds to smoking prevention and cessation programs. Yet the Northern Territory government has shown less commitment to funding tobacco programs than any other state or territory government. Given the high incidence of smoking-related illness in the Northern Territory, this is particularly disturbing. It is astonishing that, while the Northern Territory government receives an estimated $48 million in revenue from tobacco, it spends only $500,000 of this on smoking prevention programs. What is worse is that it has shown little interest in policing the sale of tobacco to juveniles. It was recently revealed that, since legislation prohibiting the sale of tobacco was introduced, there has been only one such charge. The health minister's reluctance to see there is a need for more resources to police the sale of tobacco to juveniles is particularly concerning, given reports that smoking prevalence is growing amongst Territory schoolchildren.</para><para>The Northern Territory government's shameful record on tobacco control reached its peak this year when it received the Australian Medical Association's Dirty Ashtray Award. It managed to achieve this embarrassing title by scoring zero for performance on a range of tobacco control measures. These included a zero for restrictions on smoking in outdoor public places, a zero for point of sale advertising restrictions, a zero for regulation of nicotine and a zero for industry accountability.</para><para>During National Heart Week, the Northern Territory Health Minister, Steve Dunham, was asked on radio about the level of government spending on smoking prevention programs. His response was stunningly evasive. He insisted that spending on smoking prevention was not limited to half a million dollars. 
 Why? Because the Northern Territory government spends millions of dollars on hospital treatment of people with smoking related illnesses. Even the interviewer seemed amazed that the health minister could attempt to dodge the real issue in such an obvious way. The point of smoking prevention programs is to stop heart disease developing in the first place. The minister's claim that money spent on hospital treatment of smoking related illness could in any way be considered as money spent on smoking prevention is ridiculous.</para><para>The Country-Liberal government have talked a lot recently about the overburdened public hospital system and the cost of providing health services in the Northern Territory. In fact, they were so concerned about the cost of hospital care that they recently considered privatising the entire public hospital system. But primary prevention could go a long way to relieving the burden on the public hospital system. It would go a long way to preventing people from developing the diseases which put them in hospital in the first place. But when it comes to divvying up the government's spoils from people's unhealthy habits, primary prevention barely gets a look in; the purse strings seem to be drawn very tightly.</para><para>It is a pity that the attention currently being given to illicit drugs seems to have diverted the attention of governments away from the issue of tobacco smoking and its health effects. We should not forget that tobacco is a dangerous and addictive drug, claiming many more lives than either marijuana or heroin. In particular, heart disease is claiming more lives in the Northern Territory than anywhere else in Australia and the association with smoking is clear. The Northern Territory health department's own figures prove this. In the Northern Territory, smoking has been shown to double the risk of heart disease. With 35 per cent of the population smoking, much higher than the national average of 25 per cent, smoking cessation should be treated as a serious public health issue and funded accordingly. It is high time the Country-Liberal government used more of the bounty it reaps from tobacco to prevent this dangerous habit. If the Northern Territory govern 
 ment is serious about reducing the level of preventable chronic disease and death associated with smoking, it should do the right thing and commit the resources to smoking prevention and tobacco regulation.</para><para>In closing, I would like to reiterate the words of my colleague from the Northern Territory Senator Grant Tambling in relation to Sergeant Huitson's death in the previous fortnight. The words that Senator Grant Tambling said are true: it has shocked the Territory community. Along with many others, I attended Sergeant Huitson's funeral last Saturday. The police community is a big family. It is not only his immediate family that were most upset by his death but every member of the police force and most members of the community in the Territory. I congratulate Grant for putting on record the efforts that Glen Huitson made to the Territory and I would also like to put on record my sympathy for his family and my heartfelt thanks for the contribution he made to the Territory during his short life.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs: Schools</title><page.no>7331</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>7331</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on the issue of drugs in schools. I have noticed with interest Senator Tierney's contribution to the drugs debate. Today he criticised the terminology of `soft' drugs and `recreational' drugs. While these terms are flawed, I do not think the solution is to portray all drugs as equally bad and dangerous. Marijuana is not heroin, is not ecstasy, is not speed, is not LSD. Yes, marijuana can cause schizophrenia, it would seem, but let us not exaggerate the risks. Hyping up the dangers is no match for the attraction that illicit drugs exert through popular culture.</para></talk.start><para>Brian McConnell of Families and Friends for Drug Law Reform has warned that schoolchildren need the facts about drugs without exaggeration, embellishment or hype. As we know, the Prime Minister advocates zero tolerance of illicit drugs in schools. What will this mean in terms of the $18 million National Drug Education Strategy? Can any school based harm minimisation initiatives coexist with this aim?</para><para>Hardly any of the $18 million has been spent so far. A draft paper has been produced, 
 but that is about it. The government has said fighting drugs in schools is a priority, yet it has spent less than a seventh of the amount allocated for the strategy for 1998-99. In response to the strategy, Mr McConnell cited the UK instance of a 10-year-old boy bringing marijuana to his school's `show and tell'. Should this boy have been expelled from school? Prime Minister Howard has urged schools to expel any student using illegal drugs. Perhaps the marijuana came from the boy's parents. This incident neatly illustrates the point that, rather than being readily identifiable deviants, cannabis users often come from all walks of life. They are parents, employees, executives, teachers, stockbrokers, newsreaders, our favourite musicians and even politicians. Widespread usage is exactly why we cannot get through to children on a `just say no' message alone.</para><para>We are far more comfortable with the idea that alcoholics are often respected members of society holding down good jobs and bringing up children. It does not mean we condone the addiction. Alcohol is implicated in family violence and, with tobacco, accounts for far more deaths and disease than illicit drugs. Yet, legal drugs are not addressed in the National Drug Education Strategy. We risk being thought of as hypocrites if we lecture children on the dangers of illegal drugs but do not address legal drugs. Drug use is everywhere in popular culture. We expect to whack emotional problems on the head with a new pill, whether it is viagra or a new range of drugs to treat social disorders. There is an expectation that we will find a pill for every problem.</para><para>Recent findings by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that more than 40,000 children under 14 are on antidepressants. Some of these are as young as four. I would love to know what causes children this young to be depressed and what we might be able to do about it. In no way do I want to criticise medical solutions to child depression or attention deficit disorder and so on, but we do need to be vigilant in monitoring trends in diagnosis and usage and to always look for preventative measures. Depression is endemic, with the World Health Organisation expecting 
 it will eventually overtake heart disease as the world's biggest killer.</para><para>We need a debate on how we can help young people develop the resilience they need to negotiate an increasingly tough, complex world. A recent Queensland study of children in detention showed that most have a history of hard drinking and illicit drug use by the age of 15 and inject amphetamines and heroin at 40 times the rate of others their age. They begin using tobacco at the age of 10, alcohol and cannabis at 11, drank in excess of 10 standard drinks at a session and had a 50 per cent chance of having used sedatives or amphetamines. Forty per cent of those surveyed identified as Aboriginal and 90 per cent were male.</para><para>A recent mental health week campaign featured a range of celebrities exercising their mental health by reading, fishing and playing sport. It was very well intended, but I doubt that anyone seeing those billboards would have come away with a different perspective on their own mental health. In a society with widening gaps between the haves and the have-nots, it seems strange to me that ordinary people are expected to take a message from comparing themselves with celebrities.</para><para>My office recently came in contact with a high school student who had some strong ideas on drug education that I think are worth repeating here. She is not on a youth roundtable or any other organisation that filters the opinions of young people to make them fit for politicians' consumption. She is an ordinary student at a school that is well regarded in the community, but there cannabis is rife, with children as young as year 7 desperate to start smoking. Joints are sometimes laced with heroin and speed, something I doubt even school leavers five or 10 years ago had to contend with. Kids deal drugs at this school. Drug education sessions, she said, were a joke because the students usually knew more than the teachers.</para><para>Most students did not know there was the school counsellor, but in any case counselling was stigmatised. This young woman wished students could visit a counsellor off the premises to ensure privacy. There were also concerns that anything said to a counsellor 
 would be passed on to teachers or parents. Professor David Penington's report argues against a mandatory reporting approach such as exists in New South Wales because such a requirement undermines the work of school counsellors. Professor Penington was criticised by Senator Tierney today for being permissive. This girl and her friends want to know the real risks of schizophrenia from marijuana use. And she talked of a crisis in self-esteem among kids at the school. She wants to be taught skills to negotiate the world instead of feeling like a passive consumer of education. There is a self-esteem movement of sorts in American schools, and I have been approached by constituents who argue that self-esteem education should be in schools. My only caution is that such education cannot be expected to fill the vacuum created by rising youth unemployment, the cost of further education, the expectation that young people should be dependent on their parents financially until the age of 25 and the general narrowing of life opportunities.</para><para>This girl also wanted to know what to do in a drug related crisis. She said, `We don't want to be told it's wrong; we want to know how to deal with it.' She described being in a group of friends, one of whom had an adverse reaction to an illegal drug. As her lips turned blue, the rest of the group kept a lid on their panic, hoping she would come to. Luckily, she did, but what would happen if things had turned out differently? Clearly, a just say no approach on its own is not up to these challenges. Obviously we need to reassess punitive attitudes when they get in the way of young people seeking help. This is the principle that is emphasised by Professor Penington's research. We can wring our hands all we like at the idea of 15-year-olds taking drugs, but what are we going to do about it? The National Drug Education Strategy unfortunately seems unrealistic with its aim of no illicit drugs in schools. Mr McConnell from Family and Friends for Drug Law Reform notes: </para><para>Our most secure institutions, gaols, do not stop inmates from obtaining or using drugs. It is therefore unrealistic for less secure institutions such as schools to be able to do it. 
</para><para>What do we do about those kids who instead of saying no just say yes? Risk taking is a part of adolescence. It is unfortunate that the palette of substances available these days is so much more varied. Inevitably, some children will experiment with drugs. For some it will just be a phase, and for others it will be just the start of their problems. I think we must also acknowledge that children growing up in abusive homes will often turn to drugs to mask their suffering. Schools can be the lifeline for children in such circumstances. We must not turn them into yet another agent of punishment. Professor Penington has warned that expulsion increases the risk of children moving to harder drugs and addiction. The overriding aim of any strategy, he says, is to keep children at school. In April, the Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, told the National Press Club:</para><para>What sort of message do they get if you just say throw them out so they're denied education? If you're talking about users, I'd much rather know who they are and help them rather than piling further pressures on their shoulders and ridicule and just throwing them back to their parents who in most cases won't have known their child was taking drugs or won't be able to handle it because they themselves don't know enough about the issue.</para><para>We need to listen to young people's stories about drugs and accept that even very young people may have their own stories. Perhaps we need to defer judgment as we listen to those stories and perhaps we need to come up with more questions than statements.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Living Standards</title><page.no>7333</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7333</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A matter of significant concern to all of us who care deeply about the direction in which Australia is heading is the growing disparity in living conditions between those who live in rural and regional areas of Australia and those who live in our cities. The Howard government has achieved much in its first and second terms to get the macro settings right for all Australians irrespective of where they live. I refer briefly to the reduction of the budget deficit, historically low inflation and interest rates, employment coming down at least in the cities, industrial relations reforms and restructuring and, as we 
 are about to see, a new tax system that should be of great benefit to regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>These achievements are very important in making Australia economically viable both for job and wealth creation and for prosperity for the people. However, it is apparent to me and indeed many others that there are substantial differences in living standards in some parts of Australian society, that there are some Australians who have less opportunity to better themselves than others. Unfortunately, over successive decades rural and regional Australia has found itself increasingly disenfranchised from the overall prosperity of our nation.</para><para>As someone born and bred in the country, the concerns of regional Australia have always been a focus of my attention. During the last parliamentary recess, I conducted the first of a number of regional visits in my home state of New South Wales. It was a fact-finding mission, if you like, designed to better understand the day-to-day difficulties which people living outside the metropolitan areas face. Over a period of two weeks I met with local community groups in Cowra, Young, Eden, Bega, Cooma, the Southern Highlands, Armidale, Tamworth, Maitland, Newcastle and on the Central Coast. In Eden and Cooma I was joined by my friend and colleague Senator Bill Heffernan.</para><para>I met with representatives from a number of primary industries—poultry, pork, dairy and lamb—as well as stone fruit and vegetable producers and croppers. I met with employers and employees in small and medium sized businesses, largely those involved in manufacturing and food processing. I met with local councillors of all political persuasions, all of them—like their city counterparts—struggling to provide the best possible service to their constituents, but—unlike their city counterparts—struggling to overcome the relative tyranny of distance when providing services for a dwindling and sparsely settled population. What struck me most of all was that I had been reintroduced to a breed of Australian quite different from the city folk, a breed made more resilient due to ongoing hardship. They were filled with self-determination.</para><para>What also struck me—and struck me hard—is that successive governments at both a state and federal level have let regional Australia down by failing to develop a coherent strategy to identify the opportunities for regional growth. The need for such a strategy is great. The social and economic indicators of regional Australia are profoundly atypical from the national average. I mention higher than average levels of unemployment, lower than average weekly income, higher than average rates of increasing drug abuse and higher than average rates of adult suicide, with youth suicide, perhaps the most tragic statistic of all, up to 13 times the national average. Indeed, the day I arrived in Eden some of the people I was meeting with were forced to leave early to go to the funeral of a young mother who had killed herself following the loss of her job at the Eden tuna cannery.</para><para>Access to health, education and community services is also far more limited in non-metropolitan areas, with up to a two-month waiting list for a consultation with a GP. Just to give the Senate some idea of what this really means, when I was in Armidale I was advised that the one doctor permitted to prescribe methadone to patients participating in the methadone program was retiring in six weeks time—and that doctor was in Tamworth. No replacement has been found, which means that patients will be forced to go to Grafton for the nearest doctor able to prescribe their treatment. These are people obviously in a very fragile state who are trying to stabilise a drug habit. Since each treatment lasts only eight weeks, patients will be required to make a seven- to eight-hour round journey every two months just to remain on the methadone program. Considering the rate of drug abuse is high in regional Australia and that drug related crime in regional Australia has reached unprecedented levels, such poor access to health services will only exacerbate the problem.</para><para>Finally, in political terms 33 of the 37 poorest federal electorates in Australia are rural. However, despite the obvious social and economic difficulties that the groups I met faced, not one of them would ever have 
 accepted a hand-out. That really was not what they wanted. What they did want, however, was a hand up. There have been innumerable studies carried out on the problems in regional Australia and many constructive proposals have been made to address the problems. The problems are well known but comprehensive solutions are more elusive. Whilst the marvellous economic record of the Howard government has benefits for all, the trickle down effect is slow to reach many rural areas.</para><para>The government has sought to address the loss of services in the bush with good programs, such as Networking the Nation, and also rural transaction centres and rural traineeships for doctors. One of the complaints I encountered when meeting local communities was the perception that competition policy had unfairly impacted on small communities, causing the loss of jobs and leaving small towns with a limited choice of essential services. In Cooma, Woolworths bought out its only competitor, with price rises and scaled down hours of operation the unfortunate, if inevitable, result. Whilst it must be said that just about every ill that faces rural Australia is blamed unfairly and selectively on competition policy, it is probably right that the benefits of competition do impact unevenly and that some rural communities are thus adversely affected.</para><para>Restructuring the farm cannot be done overnight. As was so succinctly pointed out to me in Cowra, a lingerie factory can change the colour of its dye in one run. To change a strain of crops and livestock takes at least one season and quite often several. Furthermore, in Tamworth it was pointed out that changing from cattle to sheep required changes to more than just the type of livestock: in order to maintain the new stock, differently configured yards have to be built, making initial start-up costs quite extensive.</para><para>Often typified as whingeing cockies, the bush is worth saving. For anyone in doubt, an interesting fact to ponder is that only seven per cent of Australians actually live and produce from the land and this mere seven per cent in fact feeds the remaining 93 per cent of our population. What was so abundantly clear from my visits is that rural and 
 regional Australia has the capacity to regenerate itself as long as the conditions are right. Revitalising rural Australia requires at least five major coordinates.</para><para>I have referred to the macro settings. I have referred to the need to return facilities to the bush and I have also referred to the need to make sure that the benefits of competition are distributed equitably. Far too often we have not taken account of the socioeconomic impact of competition in restructuring packages that make an industry much more efficient. It also requires superior telecommunication facilities and a good skills base for our youth. Then what is required, which is the really the most difficult part, is a coordinated regional development policy. The role of government is not to impose top-down solutions but to resource communities to find their own solutions, to identify what the community is good at and what resources it has to deploy into growing viable businesses and to create new jobs.</para><para>Obviously, government has a role to provide adequate transport, energy and access to water. All these things of course are vital to regional Australia. Clearly, one size does not fit all regions. Very different circumstances apply in different areas of New South Wales and throughout Australia. However, as a senator for New South Wales, I am totally committed to understanding the concerns of my country constituents so that their needs and concerns can be better reflected in the policy process.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aborigines: Health and Welfare</title><page.no>7335</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>7335</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to comment on a very disturbing report that was released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That report was entitled <inline font-style="italic">Health and welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples</inline> . It was released by both the ABS and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The contents of that report have been labelled by a number of Aboriginal leaders, health workers, welfare workers and politicians as a national shame.</para></talk.start><para>I will briefly go through some of the statistics that this report highlighted which, as the 
 nation's leaders, we need to take into account in our policy deliberations. Aborigines represent only 2.1 per cent of Australia's population. Their median age is only 20 years, whereas that of the rest of the population is 34 years. This difference between median ages is no doubt due to the fact that their life expectancy is much less than that of the rest of the Australian community.</para><para>In terms of post-secondary education, the figures are 31 per cent of non-indigenous Australians and only 11 per cent of Aborigines. In terms of adult male unemployment, nine per cent of adult male Australians are unemployed, yet 27 per cent of adult male Aborigines are unemployed. In terms of home ownership or purchasing a home, 71 per cent of non-indigenous Australians are in that category, whereas only 31 per cent of Aborigines are. These problems have been highlighted by this report and, as I said, as the nation's leaders, it is up to us to try to find some solutions.</para><para>During the winter break I accompanied the shadow minister for education, Michael Lee, to a meeting with the Board of Governors of the University of Notre Dame in Broome in Western Australia. We were exposed to a different way of how we in the Labor Party—I am sure this view is shared by the government—could deal with this difficulty by starting at the beginning with that great equaliser education. At the University of Notre Dame we met committed people. They had come from all over Australia and from the United States to try to come to terms with these problems. Local communities, educators and concerned people from around the country had come together to try to offer solutions to alleviate this suffering and to try to assist people to triumph over it.</para><para>We have all heard the phrase `to fix the problem not to blame'. I think a number of people in our country have tried to blame Aborigines for the state they are in. It is very comforting, particularly in adverse times, to find a scapegoat and to blame him or her for our difficulties or problems. In Broome we have a good example in the local communities of the cultural problems which are, as I am sure a number of people know, very 
 different from what we know as non-indigenous Australians, but these people are trying to overcome them.</para><para>During my visit I found out that it is very difficult for indigenous people to uproot and to leave their communities and relocate to any sort of learning institution. It is particularly difficult for young adult male blacks to do that. The University of Notre Dame is attempting to deal with the fact that these people have entrenched connections with their family, their land and their local community. Those roots are so strong that, if they did uproot themselves, it would lead to intolerable social alienation.</para><para>At Notre Dame I witnessed a flexible and tailored education system that allowed the local Aboriginal communities from the north-west to participate in schemes that allowed them to upgrade themselves so that they could make sure that they were no longer dependent on others, on us, and which gave them pride in raising themselves—as, no doubt, time will allow them to demonstrate. This will not be done in the short term. Changing attitudes is not like changing shirts. It will take time, patience and tolerance from us to assist the communities to lift themselves. I believe that we can do that.</para><para>Michael and I saw how these people were prepared to get involved in the education system and how they had the courage to participate. If the majority of Australians show compassion and goodwill to these people, I believe that, in one way or another, the Aboriginal people will triumph over the suffering that was demonstrated so clearly, so intolerably and so tragically in the report that was released by the ABS yesterday.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.59 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>7336</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>7336</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Treaties—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral—</inline></para><para>		 National interest analysis—Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United

</para><para>(b) Transmission planning engineers of the NTA determined potential locations for the Lilydale translator using topographical maps, and identified Browns Hill as the only site that could adequately serve Lilydale, Lilydale North, and Underwood. NTA officers then conducted a field survey of the Browns Hill site to ensure adequate signal could be received for retransmission, and to determine the optimal location on the hill for the propagation of the transmitted services.</para><para>(3) (a) The site, and the access route to the site, were surveyed for leasing and construction purposes in December 1994.

This prevented the Commonwealth from finalising a lease over the proposed site and the access route. Pending the resolution of ownership issue, the NTA suspended its planning activities and did not begin any construction of the facilities.</para><para>(6) With the sale of the National Transmission Network on 30 April 1999, the national broadcasters have, for the first time, become responsible for their own transmission arrangements, and are being funded accordingly. It is now the responsibility of the ABC and the SBS to complete the negotiations for access to the site and arrange for the installation of the television services at Lilydale. The Government will provide funding to the ABC and the SBS for the Lilydale services.</para><para>Officers from the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts met with the ABC and the SBS on 7 July 1999 to discuss the steps now to be taken. The national broadcasters are treating the provision of these services as a high priority, and will obtain the necessary technical and costing information to enable the planning and implementation to commence.
