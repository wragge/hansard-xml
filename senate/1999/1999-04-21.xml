 meet legitimate community concerns about the publication of illegal and offensive material online, that is commensurate with the regulation of conventional media, while ensuring that regulation does not place onerous or unjustifiable burdens on industry and inhibit the development of the online economy.</para><para>The main elements of the proposed framework are that:</para><para>.	 a complaints mechanism will be established under which any person can complain to the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) about offensive material online;</para><para>.	 material that will trigger action by the ABA will be defined, on the basis of current National Classification Board guidelines for film, as material Refused Classification and rated X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures;</para><para>.	 the ABA will be given powers to issue notices to service providers aimed at preventing access to prohibited material which is subject to a complaint if it is hosted in Australia or, if the material is sourced overseas, to take reasonable steps to prevent access if technically feasible;</para><para>.	 indemnities will be provided for service providers to protect them from litigation by customers affected by ABA notices;</para><para>.	 a graduated scale of sanctions against service providers breaching ABA notices or the legislation will apply;</para><para>.	 the framework will not apply to private or restricted distribution communications such as Intranets or communications not in a stored form; however, current provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in relation to offensive or harassing use of a telecommunications service will apply in this context;</para><para>.	 a community advisory body will be established to monitor material, operate a `hotline' to receive complaints about illegal material and pass this information to the ABA and police authorities, and advise the public about options such as filtering software that are available to address concerns about online content;</para><para>.	 the Commonwealth will be responsible for regulating the activities of Internet service providers (ISPs) and Internet content hosts (ICHs) and the Attorney-General will encourage the development of uniform State and Territory offence provisions complementing the Commonwealth legislation (including section 85ZE of the Crimes Act) that create offences for the publication and transmission of prohibited material by users and content creators.</para><para>The use of online services is growing rapidly in Australia. There are now over 650 online service 
 providers providing access to the Internet and other online services. The ABS estimates that more that 3.6 million Australians have accessed the Internet at some time. It is clear that the information accessed through this medium is increasingly influential in the community.</para><para>The online industry consists of a number of participants. ISPs, who are a type of carriage service provider under the Telecommunications Act 1997, essentially offer access to the Internet and for some this is their only role. Other online service providers offer a range of additional services to clients such as e-mail, file transfer services, network "news" groups and telephony. They may also offer clients world wide web services in which clients' web sites are hosted on the service providers computer systems and are accessible to other users through the Internet and caching services in which sites overseas are mirrored on their service to facilitate speed of access in Australia. ICHs host content for third parties which is available through the Internet but do not provide Internet connectivity to their customers. ISPs and ICHs are generally not aware of the content of the material which is either accessed through, or hosted on, their services unless it is brought to their attention. Often, but not always, ISP and ICH services are provided by the same person.</para><para>At the end-user level, there are users who access information on the Internet through a service provider and content providers who publish content such as world wide web pages to be accessed by other Internet users, often by putting web pages onto and ICH's hosting computer systems. In a stored form, end-users should be responsible for this content.</para><para>Concern has been expressed both within the community and at government level about the nature of material that may be accessed by means of online services, specifically in relation to the perceived ease of access to material that is either illegal, pornographic or unsuitable for children.</para><para>Some State and Territory jurisdictions (Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory) have already enacted offence provisions in relation to content transmitted, accessed or published by means of an online service. The Commonwealth is concerned at the possible regulatory fragmentation of differing State/Territory legislation and the possible adverse effect on the development of the online industry. A further difficulty with some current State/Territory legislation is that it places a degree of prima facie responsibility on service providers for the content transmitted through their service in that the onus is on service providers to prove relevant statutory defences to a Court in relation to alleged offences with the subsequent costs and uncertainty this would create. 
</para><para>The bill is intended as part of a multifaceted approach to ensure a uniform national approach to online content regulation with the objectives of:</para><para>.	 providing a means for addressing certain complaints about Internet content;</para><para>.	 restricting access to certain Internet content that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult; and</para><para>.	 protecting children from exposure to Internet content that is unsuitable for children.</para><para>The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA) to provide for the regulation of ISPs and ICHs. Schedule 2 to the bill makes a consequential amendment to the Crimes Act 1914. It will introduce a regulatory framework for ISPs and ICHs and forms part of a two tiered approach to online content regulation in which it is anticipated that the States and Territories will enact complementary legislation creating offences for the publication and transmission of objectionable material by end-users.</para><para>In relation to proposed uniform State and Territory offence provisions, it is the intention that service providers not be liable for content hosted on, or accessed by means of, a service provider's system where the service provider is not responsible for the creation of the content, or has not committed a "positive act" in relation to that content. The proposed State and Territory legislation will supersede online services specific legislation currently in place in Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</para><para>For the Commonwealth's part in the national regulatory framework, the bill will ensure that ISPs and ICHs are not held liable for content of which they are not aware. However, a complaints mechanism will be established in which any person can complain to the ABA about offensive material online and the ABA will be given powers to issue notices to ISPs and ICHs aimed at preventing access to prohibited material which is subject to a complaint if it is hosted in Australia or, if the content is sourced overseas, to take reasonable steps to prevent access if technically feasible.</para><para>Prohibited content, that will trigger action by the ABA, is defined in the bill on the basis of current National Classification Board guidelines for film, as material Refused Classification and rated X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures.</para><para>The bill provides for a classification procedure for Internet content that is separate to that applying to conventional media in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. This is on the basis that the Classification act may not encompass all forms of Internet content. The Classification Board will however be required to classify Internet content subject to complaint in a 
 way that corresponds to the way in which a film would be classified under the Classification act, that is, in relation to the classification criteria that apply in relation to RC, X and R classifications.</para><para>Internet content is defined as information that is stored and that is accessible to the public. Restricted access systems such as Intranets are excluded. Ephemeral content, such as newsgroups, chat rooms and real time services such as streaming video and audio, is also excluded, except to the extent that they are stored or archived, given that it would not be possible to classify "live" material. However, this content will continue to be subject to s.85ZE of the Crimes act that provides for an offence for the knowing or reckless use of a carriage service in a manner which would cause offence to a reasonable adult in all the circumstances. The bill amends the Crimes act to put its application in this regard beyond doubt.</para><para>There is no specific exclusion of e-mail in a stored form. This reflects the difficulty of defining one-to-one e-mail separately from e-mail with wider distribution. However, for practical purposes one-to-one e-mail is highly unlikely to come to the attention of the ABA in practice because of the private and usually password protected nature of the communication. In the unlikely event of a compliant about a private e-mail, the only action the ABA could take would be to order it taken down.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Complaints</inline></para><para>The cornerstone of the regulatory framework is the complaints mechanism in Part 4 of the bill. This will allow the ABA to take timely action to investigate complaints from the public and notify ISPs to prevent access to prohibited content. The bill provides that complaints can be made by Australian residents about prohibited content carried or hosted by ISPs and ICHs and breaches of industry codes, industry standards and online provider rules directly to the ABA.</para><para>A process for direct complaints to the ABA recognises that material subject to a complaint will not generally be originated by the ISP or ICH and that it would be unreasonable to expect them to adjudicate complaints about material for which they are not responsible or make judgements about whether particular material is prohibited. It will provide certainty for the industry in that their responsibilities in relation to complaints will be limited to complying with ABA notices to prevent access to content.</para><para>Complaints will not be able to be made about something that occurs before 1 January 2000. This is intended to afford ISPs and ICHs an opportunity to put arrangements in place to enable them to avoid contravening the regulatory regime proposed 
 in the bill and to enable the ABA to ensure that it is in a position to deal with complaints.</para><para>Persons making complaints in good faith or giving information to the ABA in connection with an investigation of a complaint will be immune from civil proceedings (such as proceedings for breach of contract in relation to the disclosure of a password or proceedings for defamation).</para><para>The bill requires the ABA to investigate all complaints unless it is satisfied that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith or has reason to believe that the complaint was made for the purpose of frustrating or undermining the effective administration of the proposed regulatory framework. However, in cases of extreme concern, for example paedophiles circulating illegal material online or the enticement or exploitation of children for illegal purposes through the use of online services, it is possible that a police investigation may be concurrent with a complaint to the ABA about particular material. The public nature of the ABA complaints and investigation process proposed in the bill could prejudice a police investigation in these circumstances. As a safeguard, therefore, the bill gives the ABA a discretion to defer action where a member of the Federal, State or Territory police satisfies the ABA that an investigation should be deferred for a specified period.</para><para>The ABA will be able to initiate investigations on its own initiative. It is not intended that this discretion will be used by the ABA to monitor content actively. It will instead provide a mechanism to allow the ABA to investigate matters where, for example, information about particular Internet content or the conduct of an ISP or ICH is drawn to its attention by a source other than a complaint from the public. For example, an additional function of the ABA under the bill will be to liaise with regulatory and other relevant bodies overseas, such as police authorities and `hotline' complaints services like the UK Internet Watch Foundation about co-operative arrangements for the Internet industry. Arrangements could include information sharing arrangements and the ABA will therefore need to be able to act on any such information received. This discretion will also improve the ABA's ability to deal with avoidance situations.</para><para>If in the course of an investigation, the ABA is satisfied that Internet content hosted in Australia is prohibited content, the ABA will be required to give the relevant Internet content host a written notice directing the host not to host the prohibited content. This notice is called a final take-down notice and is intended to have ongoing effect. The ABA's decision will be based on a classification of the Classification Board.</para><para>If the ABA is satisfied that, if the Internet content were to be classified by the Classification Board, 
 there is a substantial likelihood that the Internet content would be classified RC or X, the ABA will be required to give the relevant Internet content host an interim take-down notice directing the host not to host the Internet content until the ABA notifies the host of the Classification Board's classification of the Internet content and request the Classification Board to classify the Internet content.</para><para>Interim take-down notices have been limited to RC and X-rated content rather than R-rated content (without adult verification) because of the generally less serious nature of R-rated material. If interim take-down notices were to apply to R-rated material, this would be likely to increase greatly the ABA's administrative costs under the existing classification scheme in which the Classification Board charges fees on a cost recovery basis. It would also increase industry's compliance costs. However, the ABA must seek a classification from the Classification Board for R-rated material.</para><para>The ABA will be able to revoke notices if, for example, the relevant content is reclassified.</para><para>As an anti-avoidance measure, the bill provides that the ABA will be able to make take-down notices directing ISPs and ICHs to prevent access to content that is substantially similar to content specified in a previous interim or final take-down notice where the ABA is satisfied that this similar content is or would be prohibited. This addresses the scenario in which there is avoidance of a notice to an ISP or ICH to take-down prohibited content through modification of the content so that the description of the content in the notice is no longer enforceable. The ease with which online content can be modified (or moved or disguised) compared to conventional content makes this scenario a serious possible impediment to effective enforcement of the regulatory framework. It would also add to regulatory costs because, where the ABA identified content modified so as to avoid the effect of a take-down notice, it would then need to initiate the process required to institute a new take-down notice in relation to the modified content, including seeking a new classification from the Classification Board. The use of the term `substantially similar' is intended to convey the idea that the content must be similar in substance to content about which the Classification Board's notice expressed concerns. For example, if a picture hosted on a web site were classified because a particular part or aspect of the picture was offensive, then the ABA's focus in using this provision would be on whether that concern about the picture had been addressed.</para><para>In relation to investigation of complaints about Internet content hosted overseas determined to be prohibited content or potential prohibited content, the ABA will be required to notify Australian police authorities if the ABA considers the content is of a sufficiently serious nature. The ABA will be 
 able to notify overseas regulatory and other bodies directly, such as hot line services, if it is authorised to do so under arrangements with Australian police.</para><para>If an industry code or industry standard deals with procedures which Internet service providers will follow in dealing with overseas hosted Internet content notified by the ABA, the ABA must also notify the content to Internet service providers. As a transitional default provision, the bill provides that if there is no code or standard dealing with procedures in relation to notified overseas hosted content, the ABA must give each Internet service provider known to the ABA a written notice directing the provider to take all reasonable steps to prevent end-users from accessing the content. In determining whether particular steps are reasonable for this purpose, the ABA will be required to have regard of to the regulatory policy of the bill set out in clause 4, particularly that regulation should be in a manner that enables public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on ISPs and ICHs. The government does not propose to mandate any particular technological solutions to filtering overseas sourced material.</para><para>ISPs and ICHs will be protected from civil proceedings (for example breach of contract or defamation) in relation to actions taken to comply with ABA notices.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Co-regulation</inline></para><para>Within this overarching complaints mechanism to deal directly with prohibited content, the bill takes a co-regulatory approach in which three interdependent levels of regulation apply. The government considers that this approach will best utilise industry expertise in the development of workable and practical codes of practice, with which compliance is more likely, while ensuring there is a legal framework to deal with any irresponsible industry behaviour. Therefore, the first level of regulation is self-regulatory in which the industry will have the opportunity to develop its own procedures in codes of practice that are responsive to community concerns and assist members of the community to manage their, and their children's use, of the Internet. At the second level, the ABA will be able to intervene by directing compliance with industry codes or, if necessary, determining standards in relation to matters that would be dealt with by codes where codes of practice are not developed by the industry or are deficient or fail. At the third level, generic service provider rules will apply to the whole industry and will underpin compliance and enforcement of the regulatory framework, including the complaints mechanism.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Codes of Practice</inline></para><para>In relation to industry codes of practice, ISPs and ICHs will each be expected to develop a single 
 code dealing with matters specified in clause 56 of the bill such as procedures directed towards the achievement of the objective of ensuring that online accounts are not provided to children without the consent of a parent or responsible adult, procedures to be followed in order to assist parents and responsible adults to supervise and control children's access to Internet content and the procedures to be followed in order to inform producers of Internet content about their legal responsibilities in relation to that content. The Codes specifically exclude matters that are covered codes of practice developed under other relevant legislation, such as the Telecommunications act. However, there is no impediment to these other matters being dealt with in a single document, as long as the document makes clear which "module" deals with the requirements of specified legislation and the regulatory body which has registered that module.</para><para>ISPs will also be expected to develop a code setting procedures to be followed in dealing with overseas hosted Internet content notified to them by the ABA, for example, procedures to be followed by a particular class of Internet service providers for the filtering, by technical means, of such content. This code must also set out the means by which the ABA will been taken to have notified ISPs, given that since the notified overseas content will be accessible through all ISPs in Australia, it may be necessary to have a well-understood procedure for notification at a single point, for example, a secure web site.</para><para>In this respect, it is important to emphasis that the bill does not mandate any particular technological solutions to filtering notified overseas sourced material. Rather, it gives ISPs the opportunity to develop their own procedures to follow to prevent access to sites which the ABA considers would be regarded as highly objectionable or illegal (RC or X) under Australian classification standards. These procedures would take account of technical limitations and cost considerations. However, if the industry is unable or unwilling to develop such procedures itself, or if the procedures are deficient, the ABA will have the ability to make a mandatory industry standard. The minister will also have the ability to direct the ABA to determine an industry standard if an ABA request to a relevant industry body or association to make an industry code is not complied with.</para><para>Codes will be registered by the ABA if it is satisfied that the code provides appropriate community safeguards, there has been adequate industry and public consultation and a body designated by the minister has been consulted in the development of the code. This latter body will be a community advisory body to be established, which will also monitor material, operate a `hotline' to receive 
 complaints about illegal material and pass this information to the ABA and police authorities, and advise the public about options such as filtering software that are available to address concerns about online content.</para><para>The bill provides for a formal trigger for the development of an industry code through the power of the ABA to request a body or association representing a section of the industry to develop a code that would apply to participants of the section dealing with one or more specified matters. The ABA will not be permitted to make such a request unless it is satisfied that the development of the code is necessary or convenient to provide appropriate community safeguards and it is unlikely that an industry code would be developed within a reasonable period without such a request.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">ABA standards</inline></para><para>The bill intends that the next level of regulation, ABA standards, will come into play where an industry code is not in place, is deficient or has partially or wholly failed or the ABA has requested an industry body to develop a code and it has failed to do so. Standards must relate to the same criteria as specified in the bill for codes of practice. The intention is that an industry section has had an appropriate opportunity to develop its own procedures in this regard through the development of a code before regulatory intervention by the ABA. Standards will be disallowable instruments and the minister will be able to give the ABA directions as to the exercise of its standard making powers.</para><para>Before determining a standard must seek public comment on a draft of the standard and consult with the community body to be established by the minister. The ABA is to maintain a public register of both codes and standards to provide industry and the public with ready information about codes and standards in force.</para><para>While the bill will commence upon Royal Assent, as a transitional measure, the bill recognises that development of industry codes of practice (or ABA standards if a code is not developed by the industry) require lead time. While some industry groups are well advanced in code development, these codes will need substantial modification to meet the requirements of the bill. This is particularly the case in relation to the requirement that a code is developed for procedures to be followed for notified overseas hosted content. It is therefore proposed to treat codes for procedures for overseas hosted content separately.</para><para>The bill requires the ABA to make reasonable efforts to ensure that either an industry code is registered by 1 January 2000 or, if a code is not registered, an ABA standard is in place by 31 March 2000. The later date for possible determination of an ABA standard is intended to reflect the 
 co-regulatory intent of the bill in which industry is given to opportunity to develop its own procedures before any regulatory intervention by the ABA.</para><para>In relation to notified overseas-hosted content, the bill provides that a separate industry code is to be developed, but that until such a code is registered, ISPs will be required in the legislation to take all reasonable steps to prevent access to it. The broad nature of this requirement pending registration of a code and the possible consequent uncertainty of interpretation is intended to encourage industry to develop detailed procedures in a code for overseas hosted content quickly.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Online service provider rules</inline></para><para>At the final level of regulation in the framework, the bill sets out online service provider rules applying to all ISPs and ICHs. These require:</para><para>an ICH to comply with any interim take-down notice, final take-down notice or special take-down notice that applies to the host as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, after the notice was given to the host;</para><para>an ICH to comply with an undertaking given to, and accepted by, the ABA in relation to content subject to an interim notice that the ICH has ceased to host or prevented access to on an ongoing basis prior to a classification by the Classification Board;</para><para>an ISP to comply with any standard access-prevention notice in relation to overseas hosted content or any special access-prevention notice in relation to notified material that has been modified to avoid the effect of a notice that applies to the provider as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, after the notice was given to the provider;</para><para>a participant in a particular section of the Internet industry that has contravened, or is contravening, a relevant registered industry code to comply with any ABA direction to comply with the code;</para><para>participants in a particular section of the Internet industry to comply with any ABA standard; and</para><para>compliance by ISPs and ICHs with any online service provider rules determined by the ABA.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Enforcement and sanctions</inline></para><para>The bill includes a graduated range of enforcement mechanisms and sanctions that are intended to allow flexibility in dealing with breaches depending on the seriousness of the circumstances.</para><para>Codes of practice developed by the industry can be expected to include compliance mechanisms, such as withdrawal of industry association rights or privileges, and compliance incentives, such as the right to display compliance symbols, administered by the relevant oversighting industry body. Such 
 mechanisms will need to be approved by the ABA through the code registration process.</para><para>At the second level, in relation to breaches of codes, standards and rules, the ABA will be able to make formal warnings to indicate its concerns before taking other action. This might be appropriate where a beach for example was inadvertent or there were other extenuating circumstances.</para><para>At the next level, the ABA will be able to take intermediate action, for example, directing an ISP or ICH to comply with a code of practice. Failure to comply with this or failure to comply with a take-down notice arising from an ABA investigation could lead to more serious sanctions. Contravention of online service provider rules (which require ISPs and ICHs to comply with ABA notices and directions) will be a criminal offence and a continuing offence for each day the contravention continues. Penalties are $5,500 for an individual and $27,500 for a corporation.</para><para>In cases of serious, flagrant or recurring breaches of online service provider rules, the ABA will be able to apply to the Federal Court for an order that an ISP cease providing a service or an ICH cease hosting content. This is intended as an extreme last resort measure which it could be expected would be rarely, if ever, required.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">State and Territory legislation</inline></para><para>As noted above, proposed Internet specific State and Territory legislation will apply to ISPs and ICHs only to the extent that they act as content creators. Clause 87 of the bill gives effect to this principle so that State and Territory legislation or a rule of common law or equity will have no effect to the extent to which it subjects an ICH or ISP to civil or criminal liability in respect of hosting or carrying content in a case where the host or provider was not aware of the nature of the Internet content or requires an ICH or ISP to make inquiries about, or keep records of, Internet content hosted by the host or carried by the provider. The minister will also have a power to exempt a State or Territory law from the operation of this provision and to declare that a specified State or Territory law has no effect to the extent to which the law has an effect on an ISP or ICH. This is intended to allow the fine tuning of the limitation of ISP and ICH liability under State and Territory laws.</para><para>However, the bill also ensures, that other than in respect of this limitation in relation to ICHs and ISPs, State and Territory laws, such as laws of general application like crimes and censorship legislation, operate concurrently with the bill. The amendment of the Commonwealth Crimes Act in Schedule 2 of the bill also make it clear that it is not intended to limit or exclude the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Conclusion</inline></para><para>The government acknowledges that the unique characteristics and rapidly changing nature of the 
 Internet present specific difficulties for regulation of Internet content. It recognises that there are technical difficulties with blocking all illegal and offensive material that is hosted overseas but considers that where it is technically feasible and cost effective to block material this should be done. It is not acceptable to make no attempt at all on the basis that it may be difficult. Nor is it acceptable that community standards applicable to conventional media do not apply to the Internetâwhat is illegal or controlled offline should also be illegal or controlled online.</para><para>Recognising these difficulties, the government's approach does not rely on regulation alone. The government, along with the community advisory body and its hotline service, will be encouraging parents and educators to become better aware of means and tools to manage the use of online services by minors. It will also encourage the development of content labelling by Australian content creators and development of labelling standards and encourage service providers to offer a choice for consumers to subscribe to services that allow access to a cache of permitted material only or services that are filtered by the service provider on a best efforts basis. The government will also actively pursue collaborative arrangements internationally in relation to online content codes of practice and online labelling of content. The ABA and the community advisory body will also be encouraged to develop information sharing and other collaborative arrangements with equivalent bodies overseas.</para><para>As part of this multifaceted approach, the bill will ensure that there is regulatory means to assist with the control of Internet content that is illegal or harmful to children. It does not attempt to place primary onus on ISPs and ICHs who are not responsible for content, gives them certainty in relation to action to be taken when made aware of prohibited content and encourages the industry to develop its own procedures responsive to the community.</para><para>The government is confident that the bill, and its overall approach to assist individuals to manage their, and their children's use of the Internet strikes the right balance between ensuring industry development is not stifled by overzealous laws or inconsistent or unpredictable regimes or which result in Australia's economic marginalisation, while also responding to the needs and interests of the community.</para><para>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (COMPUTER PROGRAMS) BILL 1999</para><para>This bill makes a number of changes to the Copyright Act 1968 which are of great importance 
 to the development of the information economy in Australia. The changes will promote open systems, or "interoperability" of computer programs and products, and facilitate error-correction and more effective security of computer systems.</para><para>The information economy arises from the revolutionary new opportunities for storage, transmission and accessing information made possible by digital technology. The digitising of information is entirely dependent on processing by computers. Computers consist of the software or computer programs for the various digital processes and the computer hardware by which people can manipulate the programs. Even in that very generalised description, the vital role of computer programs in the whole of the new information economy can be easily perceived.</para><para>With the enormous proliferation of computers and computer technology and the networks connecting them, notably the Internet, there is an obvious need for computers and the programs which drive them to communicate, connect or "interoperate" with each other. When making a new program to interoperate with existing programs, a software developer needs certain informationâcalled "interface specifications"ârelating to these existing programs. Often the makers of widely-used programs have made the interface information available in the interests of interoperability. However, sometimes they have not.</para><para>Computer programs are a form of intellectual property protected by copyright. Since 1984, the Copyright Act has explicitly protected computer programs as literary works, whether they be in human-readable language, called "source code", or in machine-readable language, called "object code", which is the usual form in which they are sold or supplied to users. However, unlike most, if not all, other literary works, computer programs in machine-readable form cannot be rendered in human-readable form without making a copy. The making of a copy of a copyright work without the copyright owner's permission is an infringement of copyright.</para><para>If one wants to write a literary work to complement an existing work, for instance, a learned commentary on a popular novel, one is free to read the novel in order to write that commentary, without infringing the rights of the owner of copyright in the novel. However, one cannot learn how a computer program in machine-readable form works without access to a version in human-readable form, or source code. To render the machine code into the equivalent of source code, it is necessary to employ a process called "decompilation", which involves the production of a copy of the program.</para><para>By refusing to make available information about a computer program's interfaces with other programs with which it interoperates, the owner of copyright 
 in a successful program can control the market in products that are interoperable with the program. Only if the maker of a new product were permitted to find out the interface information by decompilation can that maker achieve interoperability of the new program with the existing program.</para><para>The law of the leading software producing country in the world, the United States, allows makers of new programs to use decompilation to find out the interface information of existing programs for achieving interoperability. The countries of the European Union, and other European countries, also allow this to be done. However, Australian law does not make such provision.</para><para>The present situation, therefore, is that Australian law is more restrictive of the activities of new software developers than the law of the leading industrialised countries where most of the world's software is being produced. Australia's software producers are recognised as innovative by world standards. Because our industry is not of a scale to compete across the board with such dominant industries as that of the United States, its comparative advantage lies in the ability to cater for niche markets. In order to do this, it must be able to ensure that its successful niche products interoperate with other existing products, including those produced by the big scale producers.</para><para>Against that background, I come now to the main reform in the bill. If Australian industry is to be allowed to compete on level terms with producers of similar products in the USA and Europe, Australian software copyright law must be brought more into line with the law in those countries. Accordingly, as an exception to the copyright reproduction right, where interface information about other programs is not readily available to a software producer, the producer will now be able to decompile another program to the extent necessary to get the required interface information for making an interoperable product.</para><para>The government recognises that commercially successful computer programs can involve very extensive expenditure on research and development, and accepts that appropriate protection via the copyright law should be afforded this investment. Accordingly, the change to allow decompilation in the circumstances I have described will ensure that only interface information may be discovered, and that this information may be used only for the purpose of making an interoperable product.</para><para>This limited sanctioning of decompilation will not weaken the existing proscription of software piracy. The most saleable pirate product is one that is practically indistinguishable from, and functions identically to, the genuine article. To make such a pirate product, one would not decompile the original, but would simply copy it straight onto a disk. 
</para><para>In approving these amendments, the government had the benefit of very comprehensive consideration and research going back a number of years and extensive consultations with the software industry. The amendments are based on recommendations contained in a very thorough report by the Copyright Law Review Committee of this government. Because Australia has extensive international obligations in regard to copyright through membership of the World Trade Organisation and other international treaties, careful consideration has also been given to ensuring that the amendments are compatible with those obligations.</para><para>The bill will also make two other amendments to software copyright law that are very necessary and important for the sound and secure development of the information economy. One of these amendments will allow the use of the decompilation process for the correction of errors in a program where an error-free copy of the program is not reasonably available at a commercial price. Where, because of the Year 2000 date problem, a copy of a program will not function beyond the end of this year, although it was intended to by the producer, decompilation will be able to be undertaken to correct the problem if an error-free version is not reasonably available, as already indicated. This is another element of the government's decisive action to facilitate the combating of the Y2K problem.</para><para>The other amendment will permit decompilation, where necessary, to test the security of a computer program or of a network of which it is part, against unauthorised access to the program or network and against sabotageâfor example, by viruses. The disruption caused by the Melissa virus infecting e-mail systems in Australia and other countries recently is a timely warning of this danger. With our growing dependence on computer networks, the need is correspondingly greater for effective security against unauthorised penetration and sabotageâand all the damage and invasion of privacy that they can cause. Again, the permitted decompilation could only be undertaken if the required information for security testing was not already available, and only to the extent necessary to obtain the information. In the case of both error-correction and security testing, the information gained from permitted decompilation may be used only for the purposes for which the decompilation was undertaken.</para><para>Madam President, any exceptions to the basic copyright right to control reproduction of a copyright work must be justifiable, must not harm the economic interests of the copyright owner and must be compatible with our international obligations. I have shown that the three very specific cases in which decompilation will be allowed are of fundamental importance to the well-being of the software industry and users of software. The exceptions will 
 in no way make the practice of piracy any easier in Australia, for the simple reason that the changes will not relax in any way the civil or criminal liability of those who engage in piracy. The government believes that, by bringing Australian law essentially into line with the law in the USA and European countries, not to mention other countries in the world, the amendments comply with our international obligations in regard to copyright protection.</para><para>These are the main amendments contained in the bill. The other amendments implement more technical changes to the protection of computer programs that were recommended in the report of the Copyright Law Review Committee to which I have referred. One amendment confirms that, where the conditions of purchase of a computer program do not specifically provide, the technical generation of a copy of the program in the course of running it for normal use will not infringe copyright in the program. Likewise, the generation of such a temporary copy while running the program in the course of studying its operation will not infringe copyright. The existing provisions of the act permitting the making of a reserveâor back-upâcopy against possible destruction of a program have been modified, to make them accord with current practice in the backing-up of computers and computer systems.</para><para>In further recognition of the critical importance of addressing the Y2K problem, when announcing approval of the amendments on 23 February last the government indicated that the amendment to allow decompilation of computer programs to correct errors would, when enacted, operate as from the date of the announcement. The relevant provision of the bill provides accordingly.</para><para>One other important provision in the bill will nullify any agreement that purports to exclude the right to run a program in order to study it, the right to make back-up copies or the right to decompile a program for interoperability, for error-correction and for security testing. However, a back-up copy will not be able to be made if it would involve circumventing a "lock" on a computer program incorporated by the producer to prevent such copies being made.</para><para>Madam President, computer software is the cornerstone of the new communications systems. It is also essential to just about every other element of modern infrastructure, production and services. It is important that the intellectual property in computer programs be adequately protected. With one of the lowest rates of software piracy in the world, Australia has demonstrated its commitment to doing so. However, protection must not be at the cost of reasonable access akin to what users of other copyright materials enjoy. The main amendments in this bill will allow access to source-code 
 equivalent in circumstances in which software engineers in many other software-producing countries already enjoy it. The changes will contribute to competitive development of new software and hardware products, intensifying action against the Y2K bug and increasing the security of systems against viruses and hackingâall indisputably desirable objectives. The amendments will give not one crumb of comfort to software pirates.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</para><para>On 6 April 1999 the Prime Minister announced the government's decision to provide temporary safe haven to 4,000 persons displaced from the Kosovo region of the Republic of Yugoslavia. This was in response to a global appeal by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for countries beyond the immediate region to make an exception and provide emergency shelter to Kosovo Albanians forcibly displaced from Kosovo. The appeal was made to ease the immediate crisis of having over half a million Kosovars forced into neighbouring states. Honourable Senators would agree that the events in Kosovo are a terrible human tragedy.</para><para>The Commonwealth and State governments and various organisations throughout Australia have moved swiftly to put safe haven arrangements in place. These arrangements include the positioning of a task force of immigration officers, medical personnel, interpreters, and an information technology expert in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Members of the task force are providing valuable assistance to UNHCR and other agencies working in the area. In Australia, defence establishments have been prepared to receive displaced persons and a range of Federal and State agencies are co-operating to provide for the needs of safe haven recipients.</para><para>I should also mention that there has been a tremendous response from both individuals and businesses throughout Australia offering assistance.</para><para>The UNHCR subsequently called for a pause of the immediate uplift of persons for temporary protection to countries a considerable distance from Kosovo, while UNHCR re-examined the options available for temporary protection closer to the region.</para><para>Australia remains committed to its promise and is ready to implement the uplift at short notice if required. With this bill the government is putting in place the legal framework to respond immediate 
 ly, if and when UNHCR re-activates its request to assist in a temporary protection capacity.</para><para>This bill is an integral part of the larger scale co-operative effort between federal government agencies; between the federal government and state/territory governments; and between all of levels of government and NGOs, to put in place the infrastructure and assistance to help Kosovo Albanians who are to be provided with emergency temporary relief. Together with changes made to the Migration Regulations on 15 April 1999, it will provide the statutory framework for the effective management and return of persons to whom temporary safe haven is provided.</para><para>This short term humanitarian measure will assist in alleviating the massive suffering and human tragedy that has developed in Kosovo. This is in addition to our commitment to work with UNHCR to assist through permanent resettlement those people who may not be able to return to Kosovo. The emergency temporary protection we are offering with the safe haven is another example of Australia's proven commitment to upholding its international reputation in contributing in the spirit of international burden sharing.</para><para>The bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to ensure that persons to whom temporary safe haven is provided are unable to apply for any other form of visa, including protection visas, while in Australia. Any applications made by such persons for other types of visas from 6 April 1999 will be rendered invalid. This will ensure that the government can meet its commitment to provide temporary safe haven and also effectively maintain the integrity of Australia's migration and humanitarian programs. Temporary safe haven is not to be used as a means of obtaining permanent residence in Australia.</para><para>However, the bill will provide the minister with a non-compellable power to allow a particular non-citizen who holds a temporary safe haven visa, or who has not left Australia since ceasing to hold such a visa, to make a valid visa application for another type of visa. This will only be exercised where the minister believes it is in the public interest to do so in exceptional circumstances on a case by case basis. This power may only be exercised by the minister personally.</para><para>As temporary safe haven is to be provided to persons at short notice and in situations where extensive character checking is not possible, it is necessary to have effective powers to withdraw temporary safe haven which has been provided to any person who represents a danger to the Australian community, or Australia's security or whose presence in Australia would be harmful to Australia's international relations. This power is exercisable only by the minister personally, and allows the minister to refuse to grant, or to cancel a visa without prior notice. Where the minister uses 
 this power, the minister must table a statement about its use in both houses of the Parliament.</para><para>Any decision to refuse to grant or to cancel a temporary safe haven visa under this special power will automatically apply to members of the immediate family of that person.</para><para>I reiterate that it remains the government's intention to provide a temporary safe haven in Australia for 4000 Kosovo Albanians. The arrangements that have been made to date demonstrate our commitment to join with other members of the international community to assist in this humanitarian crisis by providing emergency temporary relief. Passage of the bill without delay is essential to enable Australia to grant this relief, while also maintaining the effective management and control of Australia's immigration and entry requirements.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned till the first day of the winter sittings 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>3967</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>3967</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That government business notice of motion no. 5 standing in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care (Senator Tambling) for today, relating to the consideration of legislation, be postponed till a later hour.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Government Business</title><page.no>3967</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That consideration of business on Wednesday, 21 April 1999, continue from 6.50 p.m. till 7.20 p.m.

Yesterday I was referring to remarks made by Senator Ferguson designed to damage the credibility and the status of the reports produced by the various committees, in particular the main select committee. That is a process of Senate abuse, if you like, which has been carried on by a number of government senators.</para></talk.start><para>Every committee in which I have ever been involved has had some difficulties in arriving at the final report because that is the nature of the report process. However, Senator Fergu 
 son well knows that the private meeting of the Senate committee to consider the draft report did agree on what basis the report should be balanced up and how it should be treated. It was left to the chair and deputy chairâcomprising six out of the seven members of the committeeâto finally resolve the matter, with the specific injunction that government senators should balance up the report in areas where they felt there was insufficient evidence to support their viewpoint.</para><para>At that meeting, we also made it clearâand I particularly made it clearâthat government senators, Labor senators and the Democrat senator would rely on their supplementary reports to establish their position. The main report would summarise as much of the evidence as possible.</para><para>Whether it was legitimate or not I do not know, but it was Senator Ferguson who choseâknowing that the date for the report was 19 Aprilânot to be in Canberra. He chose not to be available for the last fews days on which the Senate committee report was to be resolved. As deputy chair, I would not have made that choice, but he did make that choice. It is entirely wrong for the deputy chair of that committee to condemn the process for political purposes when he himself had the ability to supervise the process.</para><para>In proceeding to the substance of the bills before us, I want to focus on the government senators' report because it is the government's packageâthe government's New Zealand package, the government's New Zealand optionâthat is being put to us. The first conclusion of government senators was that:</para><para>The Inquiry process produced no information that was not already in the public domain or had not been considered by the Government when putting the tax reform plans together and debated during the election campaign.</para><para>I have to say that this is the most extraordinary, arrogant thing I have ever heard. I am startled that some of the Liberal senators who are of high quality could assume, and put their names to a statement, that they have perfect knowledgeâthat they could discount the views of 1,437 submissions, all the media and everybody else. This just seems amazing, particularly as I know, both from private 
 conversation and on the record, that there were many facts about which they were interested and excited to hearâsome of which supported their own views. Senator Conroy will recall the excitement with which the government treated new modelling that supported their views. They did not know that this modelling existed before, but they embraced it warmly when it helped them.</para><para>The government say that the process produced no information that was not already in the public domain, but I remind you that there is a very serious issue here concerning culpability and law. I draw an example which you may find strange, but which is apposite. In France, ministers and former ministers are being prosecuted because they knew that, if you dealt with blood in a manner that was inappropriate, you put at risk the lives and health of the people who received contaminated blood.</para><para>I draw this to your attention: remember that the government say they know everything. This is what they knew. At page x of the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee dated March 1999, in the executive summaryâthe Treasurer and everybody else knows thisâthe committee heard conservative estimates that:</para><para>. . . at least 65 more people would die each year in Australia as a result of the increase in urban air pollution and traffic accidents if the GST package goes ahead as proposed. These would be predominantly young children and the elderly.</para><para>If you are assuming perfect knowledge, you are telling the courts that, when you are prosecuted for somebody's death or ill-health, you knew something about it already. Ministers are being prosecuted in France because they knew that, if they dealt with blood inappropriately, they were putting lives at risk. And you know that you have been told by the Senate committeeâby the AMA, a body of repute and credibilityâthat you will cause deaths if you pursue this matter. Therefore, you might find yourselves liable in law. I draw this to your attention when you say that you have perfect knowledge and nothing new has been observed.</para><para>The second conclusion of government senators reads:</para><para>The Inquiries by the Senate were poorly focused and mis-used by Labor and Democrat Senators who manipulated the Inquiries in an attempt to re-argue their political positions which were defeated in the last election. The Democrats ignored and misrepresented evidence which did not support their position with respect to food and GST.</para><para>This is very one-eyed. Of course the Democrat senator and the Labor Party pursued their particular viewpoints. You do not think that the coalition did? You think that they are angels who sat back objectively and independentlyâwho sat on high and did not support their position in their argument? This again reflects an attitude to the process of committee work and Senate appraisal of legislation that is extraordinary given the known quality of the coalition senators involvedâwho do know better.</para><para>The third conclusion of government senators was this:</para><para>Many witnesses and submissions relied on false assertions and anecdotes . . .</para><para>Are you saying that all those who supported the government position did that or are you saying that it was only the ones who opposed it? Are you saying that all the submissions from the bishops and the churches relied on false assertions and anecdotes `many of which were irresponsibly perpetuated by the Labor senators rather than primary source material, such as the legislation and explanatory memoranda, which have been public since December 1998'? The conclusion continues:</para><para>Government Senators therefore do not place any credit on the claims and conclusions of the Labor Senators which are willingly based on misleading and inaccurate evidence.</para><para>Let me give you an example. Labor senators say that the first-year effect of inflation is between three and four per cent. The modellers, the economists and everybody else agreed, but because the Labor senators say it, is it going to be wrong?</para><para>We then move on to item 4, `The Government's tax package entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed.' This is the idea that the package is perfectâ`Peter's perfect package'. It is just extraordinaryâwhen you originally intro 
 duced 16 bills, the detail of which was not before the people at the last election, and to that you added a further 17 bills, and there are more to comeâthat you can claim that it entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed.</para><para>The government says in item 4, `it is efficientâa single rate GST'. In fact, we know that indirect taxes number at least six and maybe seven. By the government's own laws, there are exempt, GST free, full GST, excise tax, wine equalisation tax and car taxes. There is no single rate; there are varied rates. And it says it `means minimum distortion to allocation of resources and prices and economic welfare increases by the greatest amount'. The jury is out on that. Essentially, the final conclusion of the very eminent people before us, including those by whom the government has put great credit, was that the economic effect will be moderately positive to negligible. I know that is a good outcome but that does not imply that it entirely meets the criteria by which tax reform should be assessed on an efficiency basis.</para><para>It continues, `it is simpleâleast compliance effort by business and ATO and no wasteful tax re-classification.' Eighty thousand businesses are affected by making health and education GST free and some other items that they sell will be fully taxed. Are you telling me that there are going to be no definitional arguments in that area? Are you seriously expecting me to believe that given the history of the definitional arguments over wholesale sales tax? It is the nature of sales tax law, whether or not it is GST law, that there will always be definitional arguments. Whether or not food is left out, I guaranteeâI am prepared to put a year's salary on itâthat there will be definitional cases going to the courts on your proposals, never mind the amendments.</para><para>Item 4 also says `it is equitable.' Well, this is an argument about fairness. In one of the last speeches yesterday, the point was made that compensation is necessary because it is unfair. It is a basic point. You do not need to compensate people unless there is unfairness apparent in the process. The government has used the word `compensation'. Therefore, the question is whether there is sufficient com 
 pensation. Listen to this conclusion from the government in item 5 which says:</para><para>There was no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse-off as a result of the Government's tax reform package.</para><para>Were they there? Did they listen to the evidence? That is just the most extraordinary denial of the truths that were put before them. So let us turn to their supporters, to those people who believe in a GST and believe that food should be taxed. The former leader of the Liberal Party, the leader prior to John Howard's present teamânot far back, quite recentâDr John Hewson said, and I quote the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  of Friday, 16 April 1999:</para><para>. . . the Government should return to Fightback, as far as its compensation package is concerned. If there are lessons to be learntâand there areâthen the Government should learn them.</para><para>While economists will continue to debate the technical minutiae of the compensation package, the Government really should now cut the Goebbels chant, `There are no losers!', admit that there will be, and revamp the compensation package to ensure that there won't be. Further, in doing so, the Government should ensure that the benefits of compensation are preserved into the future.</para><para>That is not Labor senators speaking, it is not Democrat senators, it is not Senator Harradine; it is Dr John Hewson, the advocate of right-wing economic rationalism, saying that the evidence has proved that the government's compensation package is insufficient. Why deny it? Why go out into the world making fools of yourselves when the churches, charitable organisations, business organisations and your own supporters say that the compensation package is inadequate? You just end up looking like mugs. That is the problem with the coalition defence of their package. They are obliged by the rhetoric particularly of the Treasurer but also of the Prime Minister to hold the line regardless of the credibility of their argument.</para><para>That is why Dr Hewson uses the most damning condemnation that can be used in the 20th century, that you are behaving like Nazi propagandists. Dr Hewson says you are using the Goebbels chant. I might add that it extends to Goering hysteria because, for some 
 reason, the Treasurer believes that, if the package is amended to make it fairer, inflation will go up, the surplus will collapse, the deficit will ride over us and the Mongol hordes will pour over the borders of Australia. We are doomed! We are going to die because we are going to give a few bob more to the poor and to the disadvantaged! It is absolutely extraordinary.</para><para>If the Senate inquiry has told anybody anything, it is that the poor and the disadvantaged will be undercompensated. They do not argue about the average, the mean; there are millions of people who will be undercompensated or will be losers. I can guarantee to you, from what I know of him, that Senator Harradine will not let you pass this package without attending to that problem because he is a moral man. So do not look to him to pass your package as it stands because he will not; neither will we. I carry on with the quote from Dr Hewson:</para><para>The principal losers will be the aged and other low-income earners, including those who pay little or no income tax or receive little or no welfare benefitsâthose whom Warren identifies as the working poor, and those who are asset- rich but income-poor.</para><para>What are the Democrats saying to you? What are the people you are trying to demean in your responses saying to you? They are saying to you, `If you don't pay income tax you don't get an income tax cut, and if you're not in the social security system you don't get a social security benefit, so you fall between the two of them.' This has been confirmed by Dr Hewson, whom the previous Prime Minister used to refer to as `Professor' in a derogatory fashion. But this chap is pretty clever, he is pretty well informed, he is well educated and he understands the evidence. The evidence is that your compensation package stinks, and it needs to be improved. He said:</para><para>But the revamp should be more than just a political exercise. One of the features of Fightback of which I am most proud is that in designing the compensation package we didn't just seek to compensate for the CPI effects of the tax package, but rather to actually skew the benefits to those who are particular disadvantaged in our society (those who, to some extent, have become victims of the "system"), by deliberately and generously overcompensating them. 
</para><para>John Hewson went to the people and said he would compensate those peopleâbetter than you would, so he saysâbut he also made a critical mistake which you have not. He took the whole packageâall the details, warts and allâto the people, and the people rejected it because they did not like the composite package. What have you done? You have fudged and denied and gone about with mistruths and misrepresentations, and the result is that the Senate has the job of fixing this package.</para><para>Professor Neil Warren is an Associate Professor of Economics at the Australian Taxation Studies Program at the University of New South Wales. He wants food taxed, he wants the GST, and he is an author of the Fightback packageâso he is on your side. In the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> of 13 April 1999 he said:</para><para>First, the current compensation package needs to be significantly improvedâ</para><para>he is not talking about fiddling at the edges; he is talking about making real changeâ</para><para>with greater assistance to low-income households. Second, there must be a rethink on how best to compensate the low-income working poor and self-funded retirees.</para><para>And finally, the current compensation "lock-in" mechanism designed to ensure that the compensation package is maintained into the future will not workâeven the Treasury now admits this is the caseâand must be rethought.</para><para>Let us go back to page 347, item 5, of the select committee's main report. I will read again what the government said:</para><para>There was no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse off as a result of the government's tax reform package.</para><para>You have lost that debate. You can go out and pillory the Senate as much as you like, you can tell lies about its obstructionism, you can tell lies about how the Senate process works and how the committees work, you can damn the senators, but you have lost that argumentâthe people do not believe you. We do not believe you, and we will not vote for your package for as long as your compensation package stands as it is. Item 6 of the report states:</para><para>The reasoned evidenceâ 
</para><para>says the governmentâ</para><para>to the Inquiries overwhelmingly supported food remaining in the GST base on efficiency, simplicity and equity grounds. The Democrats refused to acknowledge that when informed witnesses addressed issues of equity and fairness they supported the use of direct compensation rather than narrowing the broad-based design of the GST.</para><para>While I cannot repeat the endless statements on the record when we dealt with those two competing issues, let me make it clear to the Senate and to the people of Australia that when it comes to issues of fairness versus complexity we are on the side of fairness. Sorry, folksâwe are on the side of the poor and the disadvantaged.</para><para>This report talks about reasoned evidence. So the bishops are unreasonableâthey do not have reasoned evidence; ACOSS do not have reasoned evidence; the charitable organisations do not have reasoned evidence; and those who do not want the essentials of life taxed do not have reasoned evidence. Oh no, says the government, the only people we are going to listen to are the disciples of mammon. We are not going to listen to the bishops and the churchesânoâbut we will go and bend our knees every Sunday. But does anyone think that the churchmen at the end of their services sidle up to the coalition senators and members of the House of Representatives and say, `Good on you folks. You've got the right package. We're right behind you, but we're not going to tell the people that?' The bishops and the churches are telling you it stinks, and they have put reasoned evidence before us. Those on the other side are simply saying, `Discount that, because simplicity matters more.'</para><para>Let us talk about the simplicity argument. The government says that, at the minimum, the cost of imposing a GST on business is $1.9 billion. Let me repeat that: $1.9 billion at the minimum. Others think it could reach as high as $2.7 billionâfrom $1.9 billion to $2.7 billionâto introduce the GST as the government proposes. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, ASCPA, says that the cost of making food GST free will be $100 millionâfive per cent. The point is: how do you say that this entire package is ruined when the total compliance cost is $100 
 million for making food GST free, but somehow the $1.9 billion doesn't matter at all? It just does not add up. So when the bishops and the churches and the charitable organisations say to us, `Do not tax food,' when the people of Australia say to us, `Do not tax food,' and those on the side of taxing food say, `The total compliance cost is $100 million,' I am afraid that I am on the side of the churches and the charitable organisations and the $100 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âYou're on the side of hypocrisy!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I draw your  attention to the state of the house. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>  To continue my remarks, the way in which the government has attacked the Democrats is extraordinary because the Democrats have accepted that there need to be changes to our tax system. We are suggesting amendments to make it fairer. We are suggesting amendments to avoid very real problems which have been exposed in the Senate's inquiry. We are suggesting that it is not Peter's perfect package and that the government should acknowledge the difficulties where they arise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats have said that they are prepared to support a fair tax system. We say that this tax proposal as it stands is not fair. We say it will make the poor and the disadvantaged worse off. We say that its economic benefits are skewed. During the early days of the committee the economic effects of the GST were considered in detail. We did find that the indirect tax base is shrinking as a proportion of gross domestic product and that PAYE taxpayers are paying an unfair burden due to the exponential growth of tax sheltered income. Because of this, there is a strong case for relief for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers to offset the effects of bracket creep since 1993. But there is not a strong case for 80 per cent of the benefits to go to 20 per cent of the taxpayers at the upper end.</para><para>While the ANTS package is likely in the longer term to have a small but positive impact on the economy, the GST itself is unlikely to have a significant positive effect on employment. Any jobs improvement from the package is likely to come from the elimi 
 nation of poverty traps and other related measures. Again and again on the public record I, on behalf of the Democrats, have congratulated the government for attacking the problem of poverty traps, but it needs to go a lot further. We found that zero rating sufficient foods in the economy for up to 90 per cent of all food will increase the number of jobs created in the short term by 8,000 to 12,000 but will not affect the long-term macro-economic benefits of the tax package.</para><para>We have drawn a number of lines in the sand. Those lines in the sand relate principally to making the compensation package far fairer, to making most foods GST free and to delivering the economic benefits of the diesel excise proposals without attaching to it the dreadful environmental harm which will attach to it if it is extended into the cities.</para><para>Treasury has argued that all households had similar price effects, showing that pensioners, disability pensioners, self-employed and couples without children face much higher price effects than single employed people, for example. The NATSEM report firmly debunked this view. Unfortunately, the NATSEM report did not calculate price effects for households by income.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âWe did ask them to.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âWe did ask them to. This is a major failing because the GST effect on the bottom quintile is half as much again as it is on the population as a whole. For those who are not technically minded, this means that essentially the modellers were unable to assess appropriately at what level and how the losers lock in in this situation. The Labor Party have listed two million losers. We have identified 1.1 million people who are not caught by either the income tax system or the social security system. We believe up to 4.9 million people are potential losers or will benefit marginally in this situation. All of that means that the government has to redo its numbers. You can retain the intent of your package if you attend to compensation, if you attend to broadening the number of goods made GST free, if you attend to the bad side effects from your diesel fuel policy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Distinguished economist Professor Neville says that differences in consumption patterns vary depending on the circumstances of the person. Had the NATSEM modelling taken income specific spending into account, a much larger number of losers at the lowest level would have been identified. Unfortunately, what has happened is that the argument is now about how many and whether and all those sorts of things. I have deliberately put a great deal of emphasis on the words of Dr Hewson and of Professor Warren, because that line of argument is a nonsenseâthat is a diversion. It is accepted by business organisations, by charitable organisations, by the Democrats and by the community at large that the compensation package has to be improved. So stop talking about marginal changes; let us pull out a few billion to attend to thatâand you have that money.</para><para>The food issue is something we will concentrate on during the committee debate, but really we have four options before us. The New Zealand option is the government's option. The New Zealand option says we will make food taxed. I have been to New Zealand recently and I have spoken to the people who attend to the needs of those at the bottom end of society in New Zealand. The result of the New Zealand changes overall has been bad for the poor and the disadvantaged in their society. We do not need to follow the New Zealand model. The other models with regard to food have broadly been described as the Dutch model, which is the all out model; the British model, which is food out, except for restaurants and takeaways; and the Irish model, which more narrowly defines food primarily as fresh foods and commonly consumed groceries.</para><para>Frankly, as Senator Lees said yesterday, it is Peter Costello's call. If he wants to go with the Australian Food and Grocery Council to all out, we are there. We will be quite happy with that. We will accept any of those definitions that we have put forward, or variations of those definitions. I want to remind the Senate that, on the food issue, Professor Cnossen said there are 105 countries in this worldâand I think that is about half of all of the countriesâthat have a GST or VAT 
 system. The vast majority of them do not tax food or they concessionally tax food. Even those countries which Professor Cnossen has advised as to how they should treat the GST system in their country have continued down that route.</para><para>Those are often countries that have authoritarian governments, which do not have the restraints that we have in our system. Yet on behalf of their people, over the 40 years in which GSTs have been applied, they have chosen to follow the principle of not taxing the essentials of lifeâin particular, food. Somehow this government says that we should follow the New Zealand option because that is much better on the grounds of simplicity. We should tax food because if we do not it is going to cost 40,000 retailers $100 million. What an extraordinary view. This government was quite happy for the superannuation industry to incur $100 million worth of costs in trying to manage a new tax, yet it says that $100 million dollars worth of food compliance costs are too much. It is ludicrous. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>3976</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have been deeply involved in the minutiae of the tax package in attempting to understand it with as much completeness as I can.

The government is to be congratulated on addressing this very important issue in our society. The ACCI and others called the tax summit in 1985, and there has been consideration given by various 
 governments to it, but at least this government has attempted to bite the bullet.

I do congratulate the government for the way it has sold the package and on how opinion makers appear to have grasped the package as if it were a lifebuoy thrown over in turbulent economic seas. Even those who are going to be shafted by this particular packageâfor example, the farmersâseem to have accepted it. During a committee hearing in one state, it was the first time in my long experience in this parliament that I heard any group at all say, `Please tax my products.' That is precisely what is occurring in respect of the producers of food in this country.</para><para>Not unexpectedly, we have had an enormous response to the package. Some 1,300 actual submissions were made to the ANTS committee of the Senate. They were very useful indeed. I felt that the committee system did work. I know the Treasurer had another view about the matter, but the committee system enabled people to come before the committee and to express their views for or againstâor to suggest certain amendments. I found that very useful indeed.</para><para> I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the secretary of the committee and the committee staff for the extremely professional way that they approached their task. I feel they are not often given credit where credit is due. This was somewhat of a different type of committee from the ones I have been used to in this place in that peopleâand I am talking about the government and the oppositionâappeared to have a fixed point of view that they did not deviate from, and that was a bit of a problem. Nevertheless, I found the committee inquiry useful.</para><para> I also found very useful the thousands and thousands of letters and phone calls that I received from people throughout Australia. I have to apologise that I have not been able to answer them all or even a majority of them. Let us face it: unfortunately in a position like mine, which is an undesirable situation, you 
 do get a huge volume of mail. One day in December last year 2,300 actual pieces of mail came to meâand that is not counting the email. Whoever invented email ought to be strung up! So I do apologise for not answering them all. I take this opportunity of thanking my very dedicated staff for the way they have handled all of these matters.</para><para>Tax has a social as well as an economic dimension. It has social and economic consequences. It does raise questions of what is best or better, what is good or bad, what is right or wrong. There are moral as well as economic consequences; and there are moral choices to be made by the government. These must be made by the government. Books have been written about the purpose of government, but the purpose of government is simply the administration of the common good preferably in a free, equal and life-affirming society.</para><para> The object of a free society is not laissez faire; the object, surely, of a free society is the genuine flourishing of the individual human beings living within that society. To achieve that, democracy and the market must be disciplined by a vibrant moral culture which is grounded upon a shared public conviction as to what is `moral truth'. The cynics will say, `What is truth?' If the government allowed that situation to exist, then of course you would have a laissez faire situation where the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and you had the survival of the fittest. I believe none of us would adhere to that cynical view of unrestrained economic rationalism or heavy-handed dictatorial government.</para><para>Tax is a very much needed tool for governments to administer the common good. Surely, in the consideration of this very vital subject of taxation, we should all have a shared public conviction of what is moral truth and what are the principles which should guide such an important consideration. Could I suggest that among those principles are the need to build a nation and to protect its people and the need to create an economic and social order in which the citizens can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and material 
 wellbeing in conditions of equal opportunity and economic security.</para><para>Tax should not stifle human initiative. It should reward people for work, it should remove poverty traps, it should be fair and simple and be based on the capacity to pay and it should have high compliance and low evasion. One of the things that is in the minds of people when you go around the country is: how come one of the richest people, probably the richest person in this country, does not pay tax? That may or may not be so, but that is what you get all the time. So the tax should be based on the capacity to pay. It should be progressive, not regressive; that is, falling on those least able to afford it. It should, of course, uphold the principle of distributive justice. In other words, we should uphold the dignity of each individual human person, because the test of a civilised society is in how it treats its most vulnerable.</para><para>I come to the final point of what a government should do in respect of tax in our society. The fundamental group unit of society is the family, and its taxation measures should be family friendly. Why is the government proposing to have a GST? The GST is required, according to the government, because of the dwindling tax base. Why do we have a dwindling tax base? Because people are not having childrenâthat is why. We are getting to be an ageing population; we are going to have an enormous problem.</para><para>But the burden of that problem is now being placed, through a GST, on families, who are not responsible for the original problem. If Australia needs new taxes to expand the revenue base to pay for pensions and health services for an ageing population, does it make sense to impose a GST on the necessities of life involved in raising children? Does this not mean fewer taxpayers and a smaller tax base in the future? We only have to look at what is happening in Europe. European birth rates have dropped well below replacement rates as the tax cost of children has gone up with increased value added taxes. Should we be making it harder for Australian families to have and raise children? The cost of raising children is assumed to be a form of consumption taxâremember we are talking 
 about a consumption tax. But investment in children is surely a social and economic necessity if the economic system is to continue. We will get the response, `But there is compensation in the package.' May I respectfully suggest that that is not enough and that much of that is doing what ought to have been done previously.</para><para>The Labor Party cannot take any solace at all from its continued erosion of the family in the tax system. If it is going to win power it will need to have a look at both the electoral advantage and the economic advantage in Australia and do something about the family. Otherwise that fundamental group unit of society will be left high and dry.</para><para>Much has been said about food. I put to the Senate that there is far more than food involved, and I know other honourable senators realise that. There are other necessities of life. If I recall correctly, we heard during the committee inquiry that for the lowest quintile of family groups food represents an outlay of some 24 per cent of household income, whereas the other necessities of lifeâclothing, rent, transport and the likeârepresent 38 or 39 per cent. There might be people who are able to go without clothing in this nation; you certainly cannot in my state.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>âThere was a dump of snow on Mount Wellington this morning. In all seriousness, these are necessities of life, and I believe that the compensation for them that has been suggested by Treasury is not adequate. I will not go into the modelling or the misassumptions that underlie some of the proposals in the tax package.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are suggested compensation packages for pensioners and people on low incomes, and I am quite convinced that those compensation measures are inadequate. Some people have suggested, `Why don't you go along the way of NATSEM's option 7 with tobacco and housing in?' If people are into this business of compensation, that is certainly well worth looking at and modelling but, as Mr Carmody has said, you do have to lock the compensation in in some way. As far as pensions are concerned, you have to lock them in to the 
 male total average weekly earningsâ25 per cent plus, in that case, six per cent.</para><para>Whilst we are talking about compensation, let us talk about the other issue: the rate of the GST. The rate of the GST, it is said by the government, will not change unless all the states agree. As Mr Keating saidâSenator Lees referred to it the other dayâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>âThat's rightâ`Don't get between a premier and a bucket of money.' So I do not know whether that is a satisfactory measure at all. If this is going to go through, you have to lock it in in some very severe way so that the 10 per cent will not grow.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am a believer in the principle of subsidiary functionâthat power should reside with the smallest group capable of efficiently performing the functions with the power required. That is a very important principle, and I therefore believe in state governments, local governments and the like. I am a bit worried, philosophically, about money just flowing to the states without them having the responsibility to do anything about it. I understand the problem about regressivity of so much of the state taxes. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>I am greatly concerned about the fact that certain charities are going to be affected substantially by this measure. These have been mentioned in the debate, so I will not remention them here. At the last meeting of our committee, I did ask the Treasury official who the losers were. I have a response. The response did not satisfy me, and maybe it never will. It is very difficult to determine who are the losersâsome you can. But bear in mind that the government has been saying that there are no losers. There are in fact losers, and they must be compensated. The government must consider the ways and means of compensating those losers.</para><para>One came to mind only yesterday when a friend of mine faxed me, and that is a PhD student living off the smell of an oily ragâwell, living off a scholarship. I believe PhD students should live off the smell of an oily rag. It helps their intellectual capability and 
 they perform better. But never having done any of that, I would not know. That is one, and self-funded retirees are another. So quite a large number of people will be in that losers group. How do we compensate them? Treasury says that it is very difficult to do so because they do not have a relationship with government. Mind you, a lot of them do not want a relationship with the government, to be quite frank. I have actually known people who were eligible for the pension and have not claimed it. There are quite a number of those. There are people who are not in the taxation system and they are not in the social security system. The government has plenty of ideas. Maybe it should come up with a tax credit fund or some such plan that would be able to fund the extra taxes which these people will be required to pay without any compensation.</para><para>There are other matters that I wanted to briefly mention, but I will just limit them to a couple. I think it is important for me to raise them. One is the question of the international competitiveness of the tax package. It is suggested that international competitiveness would be advantaged by the package as a whole. If the GST does produce claims for compensationâwage claims, for exampleâand wage outcomes, then it may have a negative result.</para><para>I will ask certain things of the minister representing the Treasurer. How does the GST lower the equivalent marginal tax rate if income equals consumption plus savings? Does it matter for economic incentives whether money is taxed going into the purse or pocket or out of the purse or pocket? Is the GST equivalent to an income tax surcharge on income less savings? If a person spends 90 per cent of their income, does a 10 per cent tax on spending amount to a nine per cent income tax surcharge? Can the Senate be provided with tables showing equivalent marginal tax rates after adding back net indirect tax rates to the proposed income tax scales? What about the payment of compensation via social security? Does that involve economic inefficiency in churning money around? </para><para>Some of these questions were briefly referred to during the committee hearings. I raised a number of questionsâand continue to raise themâabout the Ralph committee and how the Senate does not have before it all of the proposals that were mentioned in the document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system</inline>. Are they logically consistent? Indirect tax reform is supposed to bring investment into Australia, but will the direct tax measures drive both domestic and foreign investment out of Australia? I was very interested to read an article by Steve Lewis and Fiona Buffini on page 4 of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>:</para><para>The business community has mounted a strong push to ease the tax impost on offshore earnings of domesticâand multinationalâcompanies in a bid to boost Australia's international competitiveness.</para><para>Already there is some considerable concern being expressed in that case by the Business Coalition for Tax Reform.</para><para>The indirect tax reforms are meant to reduce the cost of producing in this country. This is supposed to attract foreign investment and expand our capital stock, our employment and our exports. But many of the measures being considered by the Ralph committee have been roundly criticised by both tax professionals and representatives of groups of foreign investors as creating disincentives for foreign companies to invest here or even for Australian companies to retain head offices here. In addition, there are serious concerns about the relative competitiveness of Australian managed funds against incoming US mutual funds, about disincentives to save through life insurance and about the impact on small business and farms, might I mention, of taxing trusts like companies. Family farms and small businesses may experience serious cash flow drains. Others have also pointed out that the loss of accelerated depreciation being considered by the Ralph committee would have adverse impacts on exporters such as miners and farmers and tend to negate or offset the benefits of GST refunds on exports.</para><para>I did not see any modelling of this, and I asked a number of questions on these particular matters during the committee inquiry stage of the Senate process. No modelling has 
 addressed these matters. We do not have it before us here. Is it fair to ask us to judge all of these things without having the second leg of the package to consider? I just raise that. Maybe the government will be able to advise us on these matters. In this sense the Senate does not have before it all those issues.</para><para>The windfall losses of groups of people have been referred to in other speeches, including those who will have to pay increased insurance premiums because of the transitional costs of the package on insurance. There is also the question of how credit unions, Aussie Home Loans and others will be affected. That has all been referred to in other speeches.</para><para>Finally, I want to come to the question of whether the GST legislation is constitutionally valid. Is there one subject of taxation as required by section 55 of the Constitution? The High Court decision in the Mutual Pools case seems to indicate that the Commonwealth may not be able to make up a subject of taxation entirely as it pleases, that it cannot tax land and intellectual property, for example, under the one imposition act. These are matters that I think one should raise in a speech on the second reading. I have some advice on this and I just raise it for the government's consideration. I do not think that the enormous anti-avoidance powers that have been given by the GST bill to the Commissioner of Taxation would be regarded in the long run as constitutional.</para><para>It would be great if we could have consensus on such an important public policy issue. It would have made it more credible. However, that is not the case. I would have liked to have gone into the question of the mandate, how the Senate is part of the government in the broad sense and how our responsibility is the administration of the common good.</para><para>I am concerned, most importantly, about the effects on jobs in my own state of Tasmania. That has been stated quite clearly by the government's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy, who stated that there would be substantial job losses. I would like to hear responses by the government. I thank the Senate for allowing me to continue over time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3981</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe bills being debated in the Senate, <inline ref="r703">A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998</inline>  and related bills, establish a new tax system for Australia. This is the most comprehensive reform of taxation in the history of this country. The bills set out a new tax system for the new century. The legislation sweeps away an outdated, inefficient tax system that does not serve the needs of the modern nation. The new tax system rewrites Commonwealth-state financial relations. The new tax system which we have proposed will lighten the burden of income tax for families and average wage earners.</para></talk.start><para>The government's proposal was released before the last election and we put the plan to the Australian people. The taxation plan, <inline font-style="italic">Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system</inline>, was the central focus of the election campaign. It was debated on a daily basis in all the media. After that prolonged debate, after the consideration of the government's proposals to reform the taxation system in the country, the people of Australia endorsed it at the last election. We asked for a mandate and we received that mandate. The government's tax plans, which are now before the Senate, encapsulate these changes to deliver to our great country a more productive and more competitive tax system. It will help our exports, deliver more jobs and work to improve the standard of living in this country. We believe that, after this very prolonged debate which has ensued since the government's plans were first released in the middle of last year, we have received overwhelming support. We have received the mandate that we sought from the people and which I mentioned.</para><para>Business groups have been very supportive. Businesses have already noted that they will enjoy lower costs and be able to grow and give more Australians jobs. For example, the Business Coalition for Tax Reform said:</para><para>We believe that measures in `A New Tax System' form an integrated approach to tax reform that will improve our international competitiveness, encourage investment and job creation, encourage savings and improve fairness. 
</para><para>The farming sector has been particularly supportive of our tax reform plan. The National Farmers Federation stated that, for farms modelled, the benefits range from an average increase of $1,825 up to $49,000 per annum. The increase in disposable income was typically in the range of one per cent to two per cent per annum.</para><para>We went to the people; we received a mandate. Farmers support this measure; and people in rural Australia, we believe, support the measures we put forward. Business groups large and small support the tax package. But also all state premiers and territory chief ministers endorsed on 9 April 1999 the intergovernmental agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. This is the largest single transformation of Commonwealth-state financial relations since at least the Second World War. It improves the financial position of the states by providing them with access to a robust and growing tax base. This is needed to secure the funding for important community services like roads, hospitals and schools.</para><para>There has been some debate in this chamber about the reaction of state premiers to the tax reform package. The state premiers, not surprisingly, as some have noted, want a growing source of income. But we should ask ourselves why they want that growing source of income. Of course, they want that growing source because state governments provide important community services like roads, hospitals and schools. This is why the state governments want to put intergovernmental financial relations on a sounder basis.</para><para>Let me make it clear. This path-breaking reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations is only possible because of our tax reform plan. If we are going to help the schools and welfare services in the states, and if we are going to help the states to carry out their important health functions, people who support that will vote for these bills. Let me quote Premier Kennett of Victoria, who said:</para><para>I think the Premiers Conference is a seminal day in Australia's history. It is now up to the Senate to recognise its responsibilities and to discharge them in the same way. 
</para><para>As Premier Beattie said: `The Howard government got a mandate for the GST in the last election.' This is a historic opportunity for Australia. The government had the courage to put a comprehensive tax reform plan to the people before the last election and, unfortunately, we have seen that the Labor Party has adopted its usual `no' approach to any major reform program. This is in contrast to the very different attitude that the coalition took when we were in opposition. Of course, the former ministers of the Keating government now run away as fast as they can from the reforms that were carried out by the Keating government, but the fact of the matter is that these reforms were supported by the coalition parties when we were in opposition.</para><para>The Labor Party has basically turned its back on reform of the tax system and has mounted what is seen to be an outrageous scare campaign. The Labor Party refuses to accept that Australia voted for tax reform, for major tax cuts and benefits for Australian families, and for generous compensation for low income Australians. It is interesting to note the difference between the attitude of the federal Labor Party and the approach that Labor premiers and their state branches are taking. As I said, you have only to look at the comments by Mr Bacon, the Premier of Tasmania, by Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, and by Mr Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, to see that the federal Labor Party is quite isolated in its completely negative attitude to tax reform.</para><para>Of course, we have had people like Mr Bob Hogg, a former federal secretary of the Labor Party and a former state secretary of the Victorian division, who has called on the Labor Party to pass these bills. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the federal Labor Party, even within its own ranks, is becoming increasingly isolated as the wider community continues to appreciate the significant benefits of the government's tax reform program.</para><para>The introduction of our tax reform program will be a very significant change to the taxation system in this country. Wholesale sales tax will be abolished. This is the system which the Labor Party thinks is a good sys 
 tem, but in its views it is completely isolated. The federal Labor Party is the only institution in this country which believes that the wholesale sales tax system is a good system.</para><para>In consultation with the states, we are abolishing nine types of taxesâwhich again will help make sure that we have an efficient tax system. Let me list some of the taxes that will be abolished by state governments: financial institutions duty; the debits tax; the stamp duty on marketable securities; conveyancing duties on business property; stamp duties on credit arrangements, instalment purchase arrangements and rental hiring arrangements; stamp duties on leases; stamp duties on mortgages, bonds, debentures and other loan securities; stamp duties on cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes; and, of course, the so-called bed taxes.</para><para>The abolition of the wholesale sales tax and other taxes is vital to reduce the cost of doing business. At present, half the money raised from the wholesale sales tax comes from taxing goods purchased by business. It imposes a hidden tax on exports and import-competing industries. The introduction of the GST will change this. As businesses are entitled to full import tax credits, the hidden burden will be removed. In fact, business costs will fall by more than $10 billion, as a result of the GST and the abolition of current inefficient and unfair taxes.</para><para>The GST will also lead to a $4.5 billion fall in the cost of exporting. Lifting this burden will increase the competitiveness of Australia's export industry. The bill provides for GST-free activities which include exports of goods and services, international air and sea travel, and domestic air travel purchased by non-residents, taxes and charges at all levels of governmentâexcluding local government rates and water and sewerage rates and charges. The price of GST services will fall, because tax will be removed from the purchase of those supplying them. The GST will be broadly based, providing simplicity for business and consumers.</para><para>The government has not neglected important community services. In its plan the government proposed that virtually all health, education and child-care services, charitable 
 activities and religious services should be GST free. The recommendations of the Voss committee further extended the GST-free areas proposed in the government's tax policy. They recommended GST-free treatment for a wide range of medical and allied health services. They provide for comprehensive GST-free treatment for residential and community care for the aged and the disabled, provided that care is at a sufficiently high standard. They provide for GST-free treatment for a wide range of aids and appliances specifically designed for people with illness or disabilities. They provide for GST-free treatment for all secondary and tertiary courses, including vocational courses, provided students are eligible for income support. They provide generous rules for charities. All of these recommendations were adopted in the legislation which is now before the Senate.</para><para>One major issue is constantly ignored by the Labor Party as they attack the government's reform program. We are providing major tax cuts to the Australian people. The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the GST and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest. The personal income tax bill gives effect to the cuts in rates of income tax and provides extra assistance to families by increasing the family assistance tax-free thresholds. The tax-free threshold increases to $6,000 and the lowest rate decreases from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. This helps all taxpayers but is of particular benefit to low income earners.</para><para>Under the old system incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 were subject to rates of 34 per cent and 43 per cent. The new system applies a lower rate of 30 per cent to all those on incomes between $20,000 and $50,000. I stress that this will mean that around 81 per cent of taxpayers will have a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less compared with 30 per cent of taxpayers at present.</para><para>Lower and middle income taxpayers in particular will keep more of their wages. This incentive encourages Australians to seek promotion, extra training and overtime. More effort will now mean more reward for 
 individuals as well as a more productive Australian economy. The top rate remains unchanged at 47 per cent for those with annual incomes of more than $75,000. The $75,000 threshold will be equal to around 1.7 times average earnings, and this will ensure that average earners do not drift into paying the top marginal rate, which would have otherwise occurred early in the next century.</para><para>I mentioned the significant gains for rural and regional Australia. The reform package also acknowledges the high cost of transport, particularly for rural and regional Australia. The new diesel fuel credit scheme will effectively reduce diesel excise for all off-roadâincluding marineâusers from around 37c per litre to zero. For the larger transport users, including rail, the reduction will be from around 37c per litre to 18c per litre. This is on top of savings of 7c per litre for business users of petrol and diesel through their access to a refund of the GST paid on fuel. Alternative fuels will remain excise free on the introduction of the GST tax. The reforms to diesel fuel are now to be opposed by the Democrats, although we are yet to see their amendments. They have been promised as soon as practicable, and we look forward to seeing them. As the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out in the House, this opposition by the Democrats will overtly penalise those who live in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>No bills before the Senate have been subjected to greater inquiry than these bills. No bills that have ever come before the Senate, as far as I am aware, have received such intensive Senate scrutiny. If you add together the number of months that Senate committees have met, we can probably reach at least 52 weeks and possibly more. Every possible aspect of these bills which are before the Senate have been subject to intensive inquiry. Hundreds of submissions have been received. We believe that everyone who had a question to raise certainly was able to use those vehicles.</para><para>We believe that there is no credible evidence to demonstrate, on reasonable assumptions, that any modelled household type would be worse off as a result of the government's tax reform package. The recent 
 evidence to the inquiries overwhelmingly supported food remaining in the GST base, on efficiency, simplicity and equity grounds. The Democrats have unfortunately refused to acknowledge that, when informed witnesses addressed issues of equity and fairness, they supported the use of direct compensation rather than narrowing the broad-based design of the goods and services tax. Yesterday the Democrats provided some further signs of their proposals to amend the bills before the Senate. We believe that the measures announced by Senator Lees yesterday would not only greatly increase the complexity of the taxation system but also favour the higher income earners. We believe the measures ignore the evidence that was presented to the committee.</para><para>Let me take the example of baking products. Baking products, with the exception of bread or fruit bread, will not be taxed. But what if, as the Baking Industry Association itself says, the baker runs cheese or other products on the bread? What is bread? Is a cheese and bacon roll bread? Is a bagel bread? Is a fruit bun bread? These are just some of the examples. There is a plethora of examples which could be used to demonstrate the complexity that the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats will lead to in the tax system. After this very prolonged period of inquiry, we believe that the overwhelming weight of evidence supports the government's position. We believe that that is yet another reason why these bills should be passed, and be passed forthwith, by the Senate.</para><para>Let me turn briefly to the personal tax cuts and increased family assistance. From the outset, one of the government's guiding principles for tax reform was that there must be no overall increase in the tax burden. We have delivered on that. The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the goods and services tax and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest. The personal income tax bill gives effect to the cuts in rates of income tax and provides extra assistance to families by increasing the family tax assistance tax-free thresholds. We believe, therefore, that in 
 so many ways the system that we propose across the broad range of Australian society provides huge benefits for the nation, for its people, for its families and for the people who run business. Indeed, as I said, across the broad sweep of the nation, we believe that the system that we propose is one which deserves the support of the Senate.</para><para>A number of amendments have been moved by non-government senators. It will not surprise senators that we will be opposing the amendments which have been moved. Senator Cook's amendment in particular attempts to defeat the second reading of the bill. Of course, if that particular amendment is passed, that will end the debate forthwith. This again shows the incredibly negative attitude of the Labor Party to tax reform. The Labor Party is now attempting to stop proper debate on these bills.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âDefeat themâno GST.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>âThe Labor Party not only is ignoring the mandate that the government received at the last election, not only ignoring the weight of evidence that was put to the Senate committee, but also is now, through the amendment proposed by Senator Cook, attempting to defeat the second reading of these bills.

To repeat myself, this will mean, if that amendment is carried, that there will be no further debate on these bills.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Cook sits here in the chamber and smiles and nods in agreement. Senator Cook, the truth of the matter is, I think, if you move down this route, that the Labor Party will properly stand condemned. We had an election on these bills. We won the election. We are now going through the proper parliamentary procedures in putting our proposals to the parliament. It is fascinating that the Labor Party seeks to stop debate that other non-government parties may wish to have on these very important bills and to prevent the government delivering on its election promise. Make no mistake: it is an attempt to prevent the government delivering on the promise that we went to the Australian people on and that we were elected on.</para><para>I am foreshadowing a number of government amendments to the GST bills that we will be moving in the committee stage. The amendments will incorporate suggestions made to the government during the wide-ranging and very constructive consultations we have undertaken since the bills were introduced. These changes do not alter our GST proposals but merely refine the legislation to ensure that the government's policy is carried through in the most practical, efficient and cost-effective way possible.</para><para>With the assistance of a number of professional and industry bodies and through input from community organisations we have continued to look for ways of making the design and operation of the GST even better. I am pleased to report that this has resulted in a number of innovative changes which will continue to support our claim that our GST is world's best practice.</para><para>There are around 30 issues on which amendments are proposed. These amendments are in the nature of finetuning of the bill. However, half a dozen or so of these changes are of particular note. They include the changes we are making to the GST treatment of insurance and to the general anti-avoidance provision, to extending the benefit of the grouping provisions to small business structures and to corporate treasuries, to making it clear that the separate sale of farmland and improvements will be GST free and to making a number of changes that will make administration easier for charities.</para><para>The model we are adopting in Australia for the goods and services tax treatment of general insurance is an elegant solution to a set of circumstances other countries are still struggling with, and it gets the right result. This approach provides complete treatment for both the insured and the insurer. It means that input tax credits will be available for payouts when the GST is paid on premiums and, conversely, that no credits are available if no GST is paid on premiums. Payouts under insurance policies will have no GST consequences for unregistered persons.</para><para>The government is also responding to concerns raised about the general anti-avoidance provision. That is, I think, one of the issues 
 that Senator Harradine raised in his remarks. We will amend the provision to make its scope and operation clearer, to ensure that it does not apply to anything done or any arrangement entered into before 2 December 1998, to make it clear that it will not apply to the exercise of an option provided for under the legislation and so that it applies where the tax benefit obtained is the principal effect of the arrangement and not simply a principal effect.</para><para>The GST grouping provisions that apply for the benefit of companies will be extended to trusts and partnerships. This will ensure that small family businesses which conduct their businesses through several entities, including trusts and partnerships, will be able to share in the compliance cost benefits of grouping in the same way as a group of companies.</para><para>There are also a number of amendments in this package which will make dealing with the GST easier for charities. Under the GST, entities can choose to account on a cash basis if their annual turnover is $500,000 or less. Businesses will generally account for GST on the same basis as they currently account for income tax. However, charitable institutions and gift-deductible bodies do not need to account for income tax and often account for their activities only on a cash basis. Under amendments I will move in the committee stages, charitable institutions, gift-deductible bodies and trustees of charitable funds will be able to choose to account on a cash basis regardless of their turnover.</para><para>The government's expressed intention was that no net revenue would be raised from applying the GST to gambling. This would be achieved by reducing state and territory taxes by a similar amount to the GST. However, in the case of raffles conducted by charities, no state or territory taxes will be levied. To ensure our policy is achieved in the simplest possible fashion, such raffles and bingo run by charities will be GST free.</para><para>Amendments will also make it clear that the sale of the family farm and improvements as a going concern will be GST free. However, farms are often sold piecemeal, that is, the stock and machinery are sold separately in clearing sales and then the land and buildings 
 are sold afterwards. Selling the farm land in these circumstances may not constitute the sale of a going concern. The amendments will ensure that the separate sale of farm land, including improvements, will be GST free.</para><para>In addition, to remove any practical difficulties for business under the government's proposal to reduce the 32 per cent wholesale sales tax to 22 per cent, I will also be moving amendments to specify a change to the date of effect of this measure. The reduction of the 32 per cent rate will come into effect 21 days after the date on which the GST bill receives royal assent. This is in response to concerns from businesses that they need sufficient notice to implement the necessary changes, such as altering prices.</para><para>The amendments we are proposing reflect the consultations which we have had with groups. We believe that they are an appropriate response to issues which have been raised with us. Senator Harradine has raised quite a number of questions in the debate. I will make sure that a response is given to those questions.</para><para>The committee stage of the debate is a time to outline the general positions and general principles that various parties in the Senate are adopting. The government's position is quite clear: we believe that we need major reform of the tax system. The Labor Party position is equally clear; it is utterly opposed to reform. The Labor Party went to the election with a very poorly thought-out and poorly developed tax policy and was appropriately defeated. They wasted their first period in opposition and I think they were judged correctly by the public.</para><para>I believe the Democrats have come to this debate recognising that the tax system is broken. The Labor Party does not accept that. The Labor Party thinks that Australia has a great tax system.

Just briefly, it is about the emphasis on applauding the efforts by, in effect, the Keating Labor government to maintain or emphasise a low inflationary economy in Australia. There are many issues in relation to that, including the fact that the accord did not keep up with the profit levels of many corporations. In relation to unemployment, I think the issue is that often inflation was put above unemployment. So from the point of view of the Greens (WA), we would not like that to be seen as a particular issue that we applauded, because it needs to be so qualified that it becomes meaningless. Therefore, I would be happy to support the rest of the Labor Party's second reading amendment, but first I would like to have it amended by the deletion of part (b).</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>3988</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI just say that this seems to me to be an unhelpful process. I can understand the opposition making certain points about the matter, but it seems to me to be quite unhelpful to the way things are ultimately to proceed. I expressed my view about matters during my second reading contribution, and no doubt everybody else did as well. I am concerned about the rushing of this measure. I think tax matters should be considered very carefully, and other honourable senators will say, `They have been.' Even those who will be principally affected by the Ralph committee's examination of the measures that were contained in the package itself are calling for time. They say that the reforms are too vital to rush. I think these reforms being proposed here are too vital to rush, and I do not believe that the proposals that have been put forward by the opposition will assist in that.</para></talk.start><para>If the government is insisting that the matters be considered by the Senate, I am not in a position to oppose its right to insist on that.

 to be the case at the moment.

I know that the Labor Party has paid a great deal of serious attention to the ANTS package through the various committee processes over the months that have passed, as indeed have Senator Margetts and Senator Harradine. It seems to us that the government has every right to argue that its legislation should be considered, and the appropriate time for the decision as to whether to reject it is during the third reading debate when the amendments will either be satisfactory to the Senate and the government or they will not. So the problem with Senator Margetts's amendment is that it does not deal with the fundamental issue. So I foreshadow, as you would expect, that the Democrats intend to argue that the bills do go to committee stage and are properly considered at amendment. Therefore, to us, Senator Margetts's amendment is almost irrelevant for that reason. So I put that point of view, and we will see how it proceeds from there.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>3988</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI note and respect the remarks made by those senators who by leave have intervened in the debate again. I would like to very briefly make some points on what has been put. Firstly, we will not be accepting the amendment to our amendment from Senator Margetts of the Greens (WA). We think it is appropriate to state the record on this. I am disappointed that the Greens (WA) feel that that is not the case, but I do trust that if their amendment is not successful they will feel able to vote for the substantive motion. But that is a matter to be arrived at very shortly.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine has raised a point. I respect the remarks he has made. From the Labor Party point of view, it is a matter of fundamental principle that Australia should have tax reform but it should not have a GST.

It has taken some time for the full implications of the charges that have been made to sink in. This afternoon I wish to deal with extraordinary favours done for the former Prime Minister Paul Keating by the Commonwealth Bankâ`the people's bank'. The favours done by the bank to Keating were massive, secret, crucial to a successful sale of his piggery, absolutely unprecedented, entirely improper, unavailable to any other Australian, against the interests of shareholders in the bank and corrupt.</para></talk.start><para>The Commonwealth Bank's favours to former Prime Minister Keating are by far the greatest scandal in Australian federal history. 
 When Paul Keating began the sale of his piggery in 1994, the government he led was still the majority shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank. As Prime Minister, Keating was in effect the chairman of the board of the bank's dominant shareholder. Every member of the credit committee of the Commonwealth Bank's board at the time had been appointed by a director of the bank appointed by the government of which Keating had either been Treasurer or Prime Minister.</para><para>Documents and facts now published lead to one inescapable conclusion: that the CBA did Keating favours which enabled him to sell his interests in his piggery and pocket millions of dollars, even though the piggery remained millions of dollars in debt. The bank, as much as the Indonesians who purchased his piggery, made Keating into a multimillionaire. The bank's favours were also designed to hide forever the deals which made a fortune for Keating.</para><para>Apart from what was a remarkably soft treatment of an out-of-order piggery account, as well as failure to insist on a guarantee from Keating, here are some of the extraordinary facts which have now emerged. Having found a potential Indonesian purchaser for his half share, Keating faced the problem that the piggery was greatly burdened with debt. In short, he faced the age-old problem that it is hard to get a good price for a business if it is overburdened with debt. And overburdened the piggery was. I seek leave to table a 1995 report by KPMG, which in paragraph 7 declared that, contrary to Keating's claim that the piggery was a first rate asset, the Euphron group of companies could only continue to trade with the support of the group's shareholders and banks.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">DENMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Denman</name></talker><para>âWe are refusing leave at this stage because I am taking advice, but we may be prepared to give you leave later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave not granted.</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âThat is very interesting and we will come onto that later.

It enabled the sale process with the first great favour. The bank wrote off nearly $5 million of the piggery's debt. <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> recently reported that the Commonwealth Bank made provision to write off $4.5 million of the piggery's debts. This provisioning occurred in August 1992. As banking specialist John McLennan noted on the <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> program, `When it got to that point, or even beforehand, the bank would have pursued every form of additional security to prop itself up that it could. So to turn a blind eye to the potential rich source of security from Mr Keating, in my opinion, is a very unusual situation.' I now seek leave to table a bank document which shows that in May 1994 the Commonwealth Bank indeed did write off $4.9 million of piggery group debt.</para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âIsn't this interesting? $4.9 million of debtâhere is the proofâand we are waiting for leave to table the document. We want the facts out, and the document is there. A fascinating feature of this document which I am not allowed to table at the moment is that the write-off is recorded by hand on what is otherwise a word processed document. This suggests that knowledge of the write-off was intended to be kept secret by only those with a need to know. The effect of the write-off was, of course, to improve the financial position of the piggery by almost $5 million.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âHow much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>â$5 million, Senator Calvert. Because a write-off is a write-off, banks have rules and procedures governing such matters. Fundamentally, banks only write off debts when they have exhausted all avenues by which they could ever recover those debts. In this case, however, the bank wrote off the debt without any recourse to its security. No effort was made to recover anything from the multimillion dollar purchase price paid by the Indonesians.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Generally, it would be expected that write-offs of this amount would go to the credit committee of the bank's board. In this particular case, where the write-off was enormously beneficial to the Prime Minister of the 
 government of the dayâthe bank's dominant shareholderâthere is not the slightest doubt that it should have been referred not just to the credit committee but to the bank's full board. Equally, there is not the slightest doubt that it was not referred to the bank's full board because exposure to the full and proper processes would have doomed it, assuming that its relevance to Keating's sale had been properly acknowledged. It is, however, unimaginable that the write-off would not have been cleared at the highest levels of the bank.</para><para>Write-offs are normally the end point of a process of recovering when all avenues, including all legal avenues, have  been exhausted. Write-offs are not normally in the gift of banks to make special customers rich or to curry favour with major shareholders. Not normally, that is. This extraordinary write-off was a favour, a gift, a present, to the Prime Minister worth millions of dollarsâindeed, almost $5 million.</para><para>The Commonwealth Bank's second great favour or gift or present to Paul Keating was equally extraordinary. Keating and his partner wanted to maximise their take-out of the final settlement of the sale of their shares and Keating's option to the Indonesians. So at final settlement over the Anzac weekend in 1996, the bank came to the party againâthis time with a gift worth about $4 million which enabled a successful sale. The gift was in the form of a six-year no-interest loan which the bank extended to the Indonesian purchasers at final settlement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âHow do you get those loans?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âI would like to know too, Senator Calvert. I think Senator Boswell would like to know; he has a few constituents who have got problems with the bank. The loan does not include any balloon payment at the end of the period to recover the forgone interest. On the same night the bank gifted this $4 million, Keating took away over $2 million as his final settlementâall this only weeks after he lost the prime ministership. Think about it hard. The ramifications of this are extraordinary and, one has to believe, entirely unprecedented.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Somehow Keating gets his bank to sweeten his sale by giving his purchaser six years of no interest on an old Keating debt. Could anyone else in Australia have gotten such a good six-year no-interest loan? Bankers say they have never heard of anything like this. I invite any other Australianâanyoneâwho has been able to get such a good deal from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to come forward and tell us how. For the rest of us, out-of-order loans attract penalties and no gifts, certainly no gifts of interest-free loans.</para><para>For the thousands of Australians who have been sold up by the Commonwealth Bank, the bank's treatment of Keating must rank as one of the sickest jokes imaginable. I must say that it is almost necessary to suspend disbelief that these things could happen in Australia, but happen they did. Together, the first and second great bank favours were a gift to Keating's piggery worth $9 million.

I think your ruling is very perspicacious, because Senator Bolkus is trying to protect Mr Keating. But what is unarguable is the proposition that it was of great benefit to Keating for the bank to write off its claims for $11 million from Constantinidis. By settling for half a million dollars, the bank's action induced Constantinidis to agree not to pursue his legal action against Paul Keating. It also induced Constantinidis to agree to an extraordinary and onerous confidentiality clause in his agreement with the bank, the purpose of which was to cover up all details of the piggery and its dealings with the bank. I say `extraordinary' because the Commonwealth Bank made the write-off of Al Constantinidis's personal debts conditional on his silence on matters to do with the piggery and Paul Keating.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Together, the Commonwealth Bank's $5 million write-off, the $4 million no-interest loan and the $11 million cover-up short-changed Australian taxpayers and bank shareholders to the tune of $20 millionâall of which benefited Paul Keating. That is a $20 million benefit which, as I said at the outset, was massive, secret and crucial to a successful sale of this piggery.

In particular, there has been some suggestion that Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett is one of the 
 few politicians who understand youth issues. Mr Kennett and his conservative colleagues see the so-called generation X and generation Y in terms of vote buying rather than a policy issue. It is this approach that I believe highlights the absolute lack of sincerity that is expressed by Premier Kennett.</para></talk.start><para>It is relevant to note that Mr Kennett came to politics via the advertising industry, which, by its nature, is renowned for treating sectional and identifiable groups in society as demographic targets to be manipulated. That is why Premier Kennett has been the master of the launch, the master of the political stunt and the master of the rhetoric. It is also a direct reflection of why so many young people, and people generally, become even more cynical of politics and politicians in an age when they are seeking leadership and looking for some form of philosophical inspiration in their political leaders, rather than the shallow effort to be seen in the approach that Premier Kennett and others bring to Australian politics.</para><para>Mr Kennett thinks that if you can get in on the hip stations and go the FM radio route in discussing the trend issues of the day, then you're addressing youth issues. A presence in the popular media is not enough. It is certainly important to be able to reach young people through the mediums that they listen to, respect and enjoy, but it is another to provide and build a policy platform of substance beneath that rhetoric.</para><para>A perception exists on the conservative side of politics that quality policy development can be somehow substituted with talkback radio commentary and high profile launches and public events. The fact is that neither the federal government nor conservative state governments have produced quality policies and ideas that are pertinent to Australia's youth.</para><para>Indeed, the coalition's Youth Round Table is an exercise which illustrates how the policy agenda that is absolutely germane to young people is being marginalised and devalued. Thus, we find Minister Kemp talking up his consultation process with the 50 round table members, yet he has publicly stated that the government's policy direction will not be 
 influenced by any recommendations arising out of the Youth Round Table. In fact, what we see is the establishment of a publicly funded focus group for the benefit of the federal government, without any opportunity for formal recognition of the endeavours of the incredibly talented and, I think, focused young people who came together as part of that group.</para><para>This concerns me greatly because we have previously witnessed the minister bypassing AYPAC, which was the peak youth representative body, primarily because their analysis and input to government was seen as too critical by the minister. Since then, we have seen a peak consultative youth group marginalised in the extreme by this government. Why? Because they actually served the purpose of collating information about young people in this country and collating information about the impact of the policy changes experienced by the coalition over the last three years.</para><para>Whilst we sit back and wait to see whether the round table experiment will work, I am also highly critical of the merits of establishing the youth representative body unless you act on the recommendations that evolve from that process. Why? Because it is about credibility and about saying to young people, `We value your input; we value, in political terms, what you have to say about issues and how you feel about the way things are and the way things should be in the future.' If this government is not prepared to embrace the recommendations emanating from youth representative bodies, then it should dispense with its tokenism and rhetoric and admit that youth issues hold no place in its policy platform.</para><para>Contrast the coalition's marginalisation of youth policy initiatives with Labor's endorsement of the National Youth Congress report, <inline font-style="italic">Building the nation</inline>, which was launched here last month. The Youth Congressâwhich is an initiative arising out of the National Youth Initiative, supported by many community groups, including Rotaryâformulated a series of recommendations on issues such as the environment, unemployment, crime, homelessness, suicide prevention, education, drugs, 
 multiculturalism and race relations. The Youth Congress also issued a challenge:</para><para>We challenge the government to have the courage to include us, the youth of Australia, in developing our nation and people. We recommend that the government embraces the recommendations presented in this report, to listen and act upon them with the passion and vigour with which we have developed them.</para><para>For three days, 300 young people from around the country met here in Canberra. I had the privilege of participating in several aspects of that particular gathering, including a two-hour workshop looking at the issue of drugs. I know that the young people involved were not there because they saw themselves as token contributors to an exercise. They were there because they believed, one, they could make a difference and, two, the work they were doing was absolutely critical to Australia's future. And they are right.</para><para>The challenges that they brought forth include youth suicide and the drugs issue. Recently Kim Beazley released Labor's illicit drugs discussion paper which canvassed a broad range of policy initiatives that are both realistic and achievable. Events like the Youth Congress are very important to the process that Labor is going through at the moment in  policy development. We need to know what young people are thinking and feeling about these issues. Our paper explicitly acknowledges that many young people are prone to experimenting with the boundaries of what they are permitted to do in the context of community standards and the law. We therefore place great emphasis on educational programs that help young people make sensible choices and temper risk-taking activities. It is about empowering young people with the knowledge and the ability to make decisions for themselves, not assuming for a minute that for some reason related to how long we have spent on this earth older people are in a position to dictate the terms and conditions of survival and existence to other generations.</para><para>Labor also understands that youth suicide and youth crime are frequently born of alienation and dissatisfaction with the structures and policies of society. I come back to my earlier point: it is about how we as political leaders construct our policies and how they 
 reflect the needs of the people that we represent. You cannot treat youth issues in an isolated policy vacuum; conservative governments have failed dismally to create workable policies because that is exactly what they do. To hive off the whole concept of youth policy in one small section of a portfolio area is marginalising youth in the extreme. You cannot approach youth issues without specifically addressing social welfare, health, education, sport and recreation, and then embark on the most hypocritical path to cut funding to all of those areas and then throw money at some form of committee or board structure initiative that is theoretically going to address this issue in one fell swoop.</para><para>We have seen this too often across a large number of areas here in the ACT with the Liberal leader, Kate Carnell. In response to a community issue or problem that arises, we see yet another board or committee established with a flurry of media attention. Then that issue is put to bed in political terms. There are no solutions developed. Because of the incredible activities on behalf of most conservative governments to disempower and remove the voice of community activistsâbe they youth, women or people with disabilitiesâwe find that the power balance of how these groups express themselves and contribute to the political debate is affected to their detriment.</para><para>The damage caused to the social fabric of Australia by the coalition has severely impacted on young people. Imagine this: imagine being a young person today in the midst of the debate about higher education funding. Imagine every day being confronted by the fact that the leader of the country is arguing to cut funding. The subliminal messageâand indeed the overt messageâto young people is that we do not value them. This is what the government say every time they run education into the ground. Why? Because education is the key to opportunity for young people, not just here in Australia but everywhere in the world. The countries that are getting it right at the moment are the ones that have been brave enough and bold enoughâand I say those words sarcasticallyâto invest in education. </para><para>Is it not disappointing that in 1999 the coalition has the status of being the only Western democratic government to have reduced education funding on a net basis in the last three years? It is the only one. On the brink of the new millennium where knowledge is going to become the commodity of the future, the thing that draws economic value into nations like Australia is being divested by this government, not invested in. That is a great indictment. Perhaps in historical terms we will look back on this period of coalition government and see the structural damage that has been done by Mr Howard and the coalition government. It seems to me that this government is intent on making victims out of young people. It seems that, through all its policies, with all the focus it has on its launchism and its building of initiatives that are shallow in the extreme, we find a government that is dismantling the social fabric that is there to support young people.</para><para>Recent studies have showed that the government has been quite effective in doing this. I would like to refer to Rod Cameron's ANOP study which demonstrates that this government's approach is actually having an impact on the values, thoughts and feelings of young people in this country. Why? Because to struggle in this country now is no longer to struggle to get ahead. To struggle in this country now is just to survive. The measure of success for young people is coping. The opportunities for young people to take on challenges and to further themselves through their own endeavours are diminishing because of lack of education, lack of opportunity and marginalisation of those most in need.</para><para>This study demonstrates that indeed people are looking into themselves. They are becoming introverted in such a way that their survival is contingent upon their activity only, and the notion of social fabric and community support is diminishing in our society.</para><para>In short, the coalition's approach to young people is based on keeping them out of the big political picture. It is about a framework of policies that reflects not the shape of things to come; that reflects not where the leaders of the future will actually be in terms of environ 
 mental, social and, indeed, economic values. They are taking this country to a place where we have been before, and this is not a place that the young people of today feel comfortable with. But whilst ever they are marginalised and forced, where struggling becomes the symbol of just coping and not actually getting ahead, we find the options become limited.</para><para>In closing I would like to turn to a more positive note, and there are many positives in youth affairs. The level of initiative, enterprise, dynamism and intellect amongst our young people is actually the key to our future. We need look no further than the intellectually based industries like information technology, biotechnology and environmental technology to find where our economic future lies.</para><para>We know that the brains behind so many technology firms are not even with the 18- to 25-year-old age group, but with the 15- to 25-year-olds. It is this generation that understands where technological development is going and the value shift from material commodity to intellect, and I look forward to the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Keating, Mr Paul: Piggery</title><page.no>4005</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4005</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLike my colleague, Senator O'Chee, I wish to address some of the recent disclosures about the conduct of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating.

It is rare in tax fraud investigations to see the evidence of intent so clearly spelt out.

It is a printed document. It is not a handwritten document like the previous one. But the Labor Party will continue to cover this up, just like the former Prime Minister did. Not even Constantinidis knew of this payment to his partner, the then Prime Minister. Quite obviously, this raises the question of falsification of accounts, a very serious matter. But of even more importance, Al Constantinidis confirmed that the intent to evade tax by the scheme outlined by Keating's lawyer was coupled with an actual transaction as outlined in the scheme.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it is beyond question that the Indonesian purchaser agreed to pay Paul Keating $US6 million for his half share of the piggery. No problem. Mr Keating himself told Kerry O'Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last year that he only got a minority of that money. He said that the rest of the money went on fees, payments to the banks, et cetera. From the point of view of capital gains tax it is immaterial, of course, how the recipient of the gain arranges for it to be spent, whether it is on bank debts, running costs or whatever. The gains include capital gains by way of the sale of options.</para><para>The really important thing is that Paul Keating obviously recognises this point when he asserts how much his partner, Al Constantinidis, got for the sale of the piggery. Mr Keating said that Constantinidis got over $9 million, irrespective of whether some of it went on repayments to the bank. On the other hand, Mr Keating says that he himself got only a minority. Come on, Mr Keating! Pull the other one. Fair dinkum. For him to blame Constantinidis and say that Constantinidis got $9 million and that he himself only got a minority, I find very hard to believe.</para><para>Does anybody really expect us to believe that Mr Keating's half share partner got more out of the Indonesian purchasers than he got himself? Of course they don't. This is particularly so, of course, when it is recalled that the purchasers were Mr Keating's purchasers, introduced to Mr Keating by Warren Anderson's colleague, John Benson. So they weren't Mr Constantinidis's purchasers; they 
 were ones introduced by Mr Keating himself. The deal was done by Mr Keating and his associates with the Indonesians. Al Constantinidis had nothing do with the workings on the deal with the purchasers. For Al Constantinidis to have got more than Keating from these purchasers is totally unbelievable.</para><para>In saying that Al Constantinidis got over $9 million it would appear that Mr Keating is also counting as Al's moneys those which were to be channelled through Al to Keating himself. If Mr Keating applied the same logic to what he personally got to what Al Constantinidis got, then he would be owning up to the following: that in 1994 the Indonesians agreed to pay him $US6 million for his half share and, according to Constantinidis, a further $A1 million for his option in 1996, this totalling approximately $US8 million, or well over $A10 million. Paul Keating could only have admitted to this if it squared with what he had told the Australian Taxation Office in the two subsequent years.</para><para>It is no longer good enough for Mr Keating to refer journalists to his accountants, who he claimed will vouch that his `tax affairs are completely A-okay'. As noted above, when under pressure last year, the same Mr Keating said he only got a minority, that is, less than $3 million. This was some increase on the fictional purchase price that has been spoken about of $US600,000, referred to in the information provided by Chris Coudounaris himself to advisers to the Indonesian purchasers, which was part of the scheme dreamt up to evade tax. However, the fact remains that there is a huge gulf between Mr Keating's admission of only a minority, that is, less than $3 million, and the Indonesians' agreement to pay him in Australian dollars well over $10 million. I think it is quite evident that, even with the limited resources that <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> have, they have established that he received at least $4 million.</para><para>So it is time for the former Prime Minister to own up to the allegations of criminal evasion of taxation that he perpetrated on the Australian taxpayer while he was Prime Minister of this country. As mentioned by Senator O'Chee, I too intend to draw these observations to the attention of the Attorney-General.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Party of Australia</title><title>Corporate Tax Reform</title><title>Rural Industries</title><page.no>4007</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4007</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is a government that prides itself on its free trade credentials. The Deputy Prime Minister, in his folksy style, has spent a lot of time travelling from China to Chile, from Gambia to Guinea, from Monaco to Mozambique and from Portugal to Paraguay pushing the interests of Australian industries. Mr Fischer has managed to quite effectively implement a lot of initiatives developed by the previous Labor government and for those efforts he deserves some recognition. But Mr Fischer and his government have absolutely focused on the big end of town. This is the modern National Party of Australia. They have been drawn to the Liberal focus, a focus that is now almost exclusively on meeting the demands of corporate Australia. The latest examples are the recommendations contained in the Ralph report on corporate tax reform.</para></talk.start><para>Senators may have seen an article in Monday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> written by its rural writer, Kathy Bolt. Kathy Bolt reported that the National Farmers Federation, an organisation that also has a reputation for focusing on the big end of the town at the expense of farm families, has formed the view that the Ralph corporate tax package does not look good for Australia's 115,000 farmers. The NFF tax expert Bob Douglas is quoted as saying:</para><para>We are finding more bad news every day as we talk to officials.</para><para>So the NFF conclusion is that the tax package takes away from small business and gives to big business. The article also quotes NFF Executive Director, Wendy Craik, as saying:</para><para>Many of the options included in the [Ralph] discussion paper would make agriculture less internationally competitive, would discriminate against farmers and significantly increase the complexity of the tax system.</para><para>So Australia's farmers will be the losers out of the government's corporate tax reforms, just as the whole of regional Australia will be big losers from the GSTâif it ever gets through the Senate. The only issue is: how big will their losses be?</para><para>The Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson, did in fact put his hand up in opposition to the government's plans to remove accelerated depreciation. But he only put it up once and only when no-one was watching. The National Party will again wait for crumbs from the cabinet table on corporate tax reform, just as it has on every key issue since the 1996 federal election. The hierarchy of the National Party has abandoned the interests of regional and rural Australia. The party has lost one constituency but it has not been able to replace it with another. The Nationals no longer effectively represent the bush, nor do they effectively represent corporate Australia. This is becoming increasingly obvious at the ballot box. One only has to look at the rise of One Nation, and one only has to look back as far as the recent New South Wales state election and the success of the Country Summit Alliance.</para><para>I note that, following the thrashing handed out to the Nationals in New South Wales, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Anderson, was reported as attacking his own candidates. In a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 3 April, Mr Anderson was quoted as saying:</para><para>There were some very effective campaigns by individuals, coinciding with some not so good campaigning by us.</para><para>A very frank concession that the Nationals were badly beaten on what was once their very own home turf. So the shift of the National Party's focus to the interests of big business has also been highlighted by a lack of interest in smaller intensive rural industries. In fact, on occasions this lack of interest has developed into outright antagonism towards key regional employers such as pork and chicken producers. The government now ignores the pork industry peak body, the Pork Council of Australia, because it dared to stand up for its members. It was not prepared to accept a third-rate policy response to a first-rate problem that was sending people to the wallâand nor should it.</para><para>On one occasion, the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, showed representatives of the Australian Chicken Growers Association the door be 
 cause he did not like what they had to say about the failure of his government to properly and effectively advance their interests. He threw them out of his office. The government was, however, forced to take a closer look at that industry, and the combined resources of the Senateâgovernment senators includedâand the industry finally forced a proper policy response. The government was also forced to help pork producers, albeit reluctantly.</para><para>Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, it is now time for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Vaile, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, to help Australia's honey producers, and the first step should be to focus on opening up exports into New Zealand. The honey industry is not a big industry, nor is the New Zealand market for our product a big market, but they are both important. You would recall that in February I raised some concerns about the manner in which Australia had negotiatedâor, more accurately, failed to negotiateâaccess for our honey into the New Zealand markets. Former Senator Collins and I have pursued this issue through estimates processes for some time.</para><para>I recently received an answer to a question on notice that detailed what had been a very tortuous and, to date, unsuccessful process. A proposal for the export of Australian honey to New Zealand was first provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to the New Zealand Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheriesâwhich I will describe as the MAFâon 24 July 1991. In response, New Zealand authorities raised concerns about European foulbrood disease but not chalkbrood disease as the latter was already present in New Zealand. The AQIS proposal of 24 July had, in fact, already addressed the problem of foulbrood by the inclusion of a scientifically based heat treatment regime. The New Zealand authorities formally responded to the AQIS proposal on 20 July the following year.</para><para>The MAF draft import conditions essentially endorsed the AQIS proposal, including the parameters for heat treatment. According to a letter that accompanied the MAF proposal, it was endorsed by the Chief Veterinary Officer of New Zealand. That letter did refer to the 
 provision of one month to allow for comment from the New Zealand beekeeping industry on the contents of the draft proposal. In October 1992, the MAF advised that it had received technical information in conflict with the draft import conditions for Australian honey. The MAF further elaborated on those concerns and sought detailed documentation on the epidemiology of foulbrood. The MAF wanted more detail on the proposed heat treatment, as well as documentation on the American foulbrood and its presence in both Australia and New Zealand. There was no request for refinement of the heat treatment regime.</para><para>AQIS provided the information requested by MAF on 11 December 1992. Since then, AQIS has made several inquiries of MAF in relation to finalisation of an import protocol, but MAF has not provided a positive response. In August 1993, MAF proposed to undertake a full quantitative analysis of the risks associated with the importation of Australian honey. That work was, in fact, finalised in January 1994, but it concluded that a number of technical issues remained unresolved. Then, in December 1995, MAF did finally provide a draft decision on the proposal to import Australian honey. The draft decision concluded that Australian honey would be permitted into New Zealand only from areas known to be free of European foulbrood. There was an application from Western Australia, Madam Acting Deputy Presidentâyour state; a state free of foulbroodâat the end of last year. MAF responded with yet more technical queries on 12 February this year and again on 23 February. Meanwhile, New Zealand honey continues to come into Australia, as it has done for nearly a decade. It is time that the government applied some resources to resolve this issue.</para><para>There is a range of reasons why the National Party is in decline, if I follow on from what I have been saying. I have referred to a number of those earlier today, but perhaps to reveal an insight into the problems the National Party faces one has to look at the interview given by the soon to depart Senator Bill O'Chee on ABC radio. Senator O'Chee was interviewed on the program <inline font-style="italic">The World 
 Today</inline> on 29 March. He was asked what the Nationals could do to overcome the real beating the party copped in rural New South Wales and whether he thought the party could recover. He said that the Nationals could recover because they were the only party that could deliver to regional Australia, whereas Independents like Tony Windsor could deliver nothing. He then said, `That is why we will be as indispensable in the future as we have been in the past.' What smug arrogance! It seems to me that at the point where a politician decides that he or she is indispensable, they are exactly the opposite. To see yourself as indispensable is, in fact, to take the electorate for granted. It is the beginning of the end. And the end for Senator O'Chee is 30 June of this year. Senator Calvert referred to him earlier as `my former colleague', so I guess that is perhaps seeing the end sooner than it really is.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Anzac Day</title><title>Sheean, Mr Ted</title><page.no>4009</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4009</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs we as a nation and as a parliament debate the taxation reform package, the need for fiscal responsibility, industrial reform and other important issues, it is important to take time out to reflect on why we enjoy such unparalleled freedom and wealth.

That willingness to sacrifice and to make oneself available for the defence of one's nation lives on, as was shown so tragically in Malaysia in recent days with the death of two of Australia's finest. As we mourn two of Australia's finest and their families mourn a husband and father, those of us who seek to be of service through public life are confronted with the totality of the commitment made by so many of our service men and women.

In an era when certain commentators feel compelled to peddle a distorted black armband version of Australian history, there is a need to remind Australians of our proud history.

We were waiting at the back of the Hercules for the luggage to be unloaded when Senator Ray said to then Senator McMullan, `We'd better get a wriggle on, mate.' Senator McMullan said, `Well, the dinner doesn't start until 8 o'clock.' Senator Ray replied, `That's all very well, but we need plenty of time to have a pizza first.'</para><para>What is basic food?

 then I want the ingredientsâthe fresh food ingredientsâand I want you to sell them to me separately.

Senator Lees said that the industry in the UK was the cause of many of the problems in Europe. I would have thought it was the victim. What is food? Bread is a basic essential of life.

This is not about deciding what Australians ought to eat or what they ought not eat. If Senator Ray wants to have five pizzas a day, well good luck to him. He should not be penalised through the tax system for doing that. He should simply pay his money up front, as everyone else will be expected to do, and not

It is the case that the 13 years of Labor rule are generally regarded as wasted opportunities in Australia, but there were some rare exceptions.

They exist in every state and territory within the targeted industry sectors of manufacturing, information and communications, mining and energy, agriculture and rural based manufacturing, the environment and medical science and technology. The total research investment for this round of funding is $1,866 million over a seven-year period of which the Commonwealth will contribute $397 million.

We have been getting used to it over the last few days since Senator Hill has been overseas, but what a pathetic performance by Senator Alston. He has fudged and weaved and obfuscated but he cannot avoid the fact that he cannot explain to the Senate or to the Australian people the government's policy on two crucial issues in the GST packageâthat is, the adverse effect on people in our community on low incomes and the erosion of pensioners' compensation. He simply does not know. That has been his form all weekâa disgraceful week. Thank God it is Wednesday. At least we have only one question time to go from Senator Alston.</para><para>I suspect that at the beginning of the week Senator Alston said to the powers that be in the Prime Minister's office and the Treasurer's office, `Look, I haven't got a clue about the goods and services tax. What should I do in Senate question time?' and someone said to him, `Oh well, Treasurer Costello wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on Monday. That'll provide all the answers that you'll need.' So Senator Alston has come into the chamber with this particular article and 
 with what he thought would be the relevant parts highlighted and he has used quotations from that particular article all week in an attempt to answer important, simple questions directed to him in relation to this fundamental issue of public policy in this country, and he has failed.</para><para>We have had a situation where Senator Alston today could not answer an important question from Senator Cook. He floundered in attempting to answer a question from Senator Murphy instead of addressing that important issue, which was the apparent forfeiting by pensioners of the next two scheduled automatic indexation adjustments of their pensions. Again, what could Senator Alston do? Nothing but resort to reading out selected highlighted parts of Treasurer Costello's article in Monday's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. Senator Murphy and Senator Cook are still waiting for answers to the questions they directed to Senator Alston today.</para><para>Then, as a bit of a confidence builder for Senator Alston, what did he decide to do on the next question that was directed to him? It was about the Queensland National Party. He cannot tee off at the opposition and he has got no idea how to defend the goods and services tax. So what does he do? He tees off on the Queensland National Party. The only punch he landed in question time today was on the Queensland National Partyâand he humiliated them. He absolutely humiliated the Queensland National Party. Really, I think that is what it is all about with Senator Alston. He has no idea about the key issues of public policy, but he is perfectly willing to put the slipper into those colleaguesâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThey are an easy mark, though.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âThey are an easy mark, it is true.

 Alston has shaped up and come in here this weekâhe knew it was his big chance with Senator Hill away in New York. He has always wanted to be leader, and he wanted to show his colleagues how good he is and that he could really fill the shoes of Senator Hill. Let us be honest: they are not big shoes to fill, but he has failed the test.

It is quite obvious that, when somebody has not got the wit or the brains to actually put forward an argument, they have to be involved in personal attack. What the Labor Party are doing is failing to face up to the fact that they failed in government to reform the taxation system. All they did was to rely on the wholesale sales tax system, and the taxation policy that they took to the last election is now in shambles. They were going to have capital gains tax on capital gains items purchased before 1985; they got rid of that days after the election. They were going to have a tax on four-wheel drives; they got rid of that days after the election. All that is left of their tax policy is to take wholesale sales tax off orange juice and put it on caviar. That is all that is left of their policy: a shell. They have no ideas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Gary Johns, a former Keating minister, said in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 25 Novemberâand I am sure he would say it again:</para><para>Labor promised then not to raise taxes and to provide income tax cuts.</para><para>This is before the 1993 election.

In fact, they failed to give the l-a-w tax cuts that they said they were going to give. So to stand up here today and say, like Senator Faulkner did, that Senator Alston did not have the answers is absolutely outrageous. As Peter Costello said in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  on Monday:</para><para>This is the first time a government has provided real assistance to low-income earners to cover the effect of indirect tax changes.</para><para>If the Labor Party were prepared to own up to that, and if they were so concerned about low income families and people on pensions, they would look to the future and say, `We need a taxation system that is sustainable into the future. We need a taxation system that relies on an expanding sector of the economy, not a contracting sector of the economy as we now have with taxes based on goods.' As services expand, we end up with a larger pool of money and the premiersâLabor premiers includedâhave admitted that; Labor, at the federal level, is totally out of step.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, they all have an opportunity on the other side.

But they have not got a vision. They cannot see beyond their policy bellybutton; in fact they do not have a policy to put forward. The only policy they have on tax, as I said, is to take wholesale 
 sales tax off orange juice and put it on caviar. It is absolutely outrageous.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The ALP has forgotten its former leader's supportâand should we mention him, after the speeches we heard at lunchtime today? But the former Labor Prime Minister recognised the need for taxation reform; the current Leader of the Opposition cannot bring himself to support taxation reform. In particular, the former Labor Prime Minister supported a consumption tax. Paul Keating highlighted the three main advantages of a consumption tax, and I will repeat them. First, it would allow a more rational indirect tax system than the wholesale sales tax system. But what do the ALP do? They stick to the wholesale sales tax system. That is their policy. Second, it would allow greater tax revenues to be generated for the benefit of individuals' tax rate reduction, and it would generate tax from those who evade or avoid income tax. Third, it would provide a useful net dividend for distribution to the rest of the community. But they have turned away from that. They have failed to acknowledge that there is a need for taxation reform in this country and would hold Australia back. They do not care about the future of our social security system, the future of our health system, or the future of the states and their need to provide services to the community.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>âWorking families.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âThat is right.

Maybe we have not been fair to him, because what we have to do historically is look back at the people who have held the position of leading the coalition in this chamber. I can go back 18 years. We go back and look at Sir John Carrick, a very tough character, a very bright character and also, I have to say, which is rare for me, a very decent character. He led the Liberal 
 Party here for many years. He was succeeded by Senator Chaney, who had all those avuncular and urbane skills that we came to at least respect, if not love. Finally we had Senator Hill, who often I think tries to answer questions. Senator Hill, for all the faults that he might have, especially at estimates committees and at question time, does actually try to understand and grasp what the question is and actually respond to the question, with the odd diversion and the odd bit of abuse.</para></talk.start><para>But what do we have with Senator Alston? He approaches it in an entirely different manner. His view of question time is that he is here for an hour being kept out of his office and his job is just to totally avoid answering a question. The first technique he adopts is what I would call the `village idiot' approach. He pretends he does not understand the question and he just gives an entirely different answer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âI hope you are not reflecting upon the senator.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âI said `approach'. I certainly did not refer to him in those terms and never would. I said that this is his technique of answering questions. The second approach is: if you can find a brief, just read it out. He needs about two staff members to bring all his briefs down these days, because over the years he has become rather notorious for never reading them before he comes in. So his normal technique is to sit where he is now and have the staff hand over a page, which he parrots out.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With Senator Alston having been promoted to leading this week, we have now got what we call the nine-foot syndrome. He cannot actually be given a brief, so he has actually got to find them for himself. This is a very difficult task for an indolent minister if you have never looked at the pack before in your life. That is the situation we have been in. Hence he plucked figures out of the air yesterday about 81 per cent being better off and no-one being worse off, implying that 19 per cent of people are in a dead-set neutral position. The mathematical possibility of that is 10 with many hundreds and thousands of noughts added to it in terms of odds if you actually ever tried to create that. So that is the 
 situation we are in. A bit of abuse around the chamber is standard operating procedure for Senator Alston when he is trying to bluff his way out of a difficult question, pull a few figures out of the air, quote from Peter Costello's article and pick up your pay cheque at the end of the week.</para><para>This sort of intellectual torpor is absolute humiliation to the Liberal Party of Australia. That is what it isâan absolute humiliation for the Liberal Party. You can see his own supporters cringing at this lack of ability to represent them out front. But what you cannot see on their faces yet, I have to concede, is who is planning to replace him one day. I am sure they are there but, even with my experience in these things, I cannot quite read it.</para><para>But if ever you want to see something worth criticising it is Senator Alston's absolute cynicism in answering the question on Mrs De-Anne Kelly. If you actually disaggregate the answer, what do you find? Basically what he is saying is that Mrs Kelly holds those views because she is in a rural electorate and that is okay. What Senator Alston is basically saying is that it is okay for the coalition to be two-faced; it is okay for Mrs De-Anne Kelly to go up and campaign in the electorate of Dawson on non-coalition policy in order for her to win a seat. That is what he is arguing, that it is okay to work both sides of the street. He often goes on and talks about the plurality in the Liberal Party, yet what do we get the moment someone in the coalition disagrees? Let me quote Mr Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom. Describing Mrs Kelly, he said:</para><para>She operates in a treacherous manner. She operates without respect for teamwork required to operate a successful coalition.</para><para>So in this modern-day Liberal-National Party, if you disagree, you are accused of being treacherous. Finally, when Senator Alston finds a newspaper reporter, Mr Seccombe, with whom he disagrees, he does not just say, `I disagree with the article,' but dismisses it as trivia and then questions why the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  employs that person.

They talked about the difficulties that they faced under the current sales tax regime and the great need for tax reform to unravel the appalling red tape which now grips those small businesses as they try to understand the tax reform system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>However, as much as possible, the evidence that came from unions who were rounded up to give evidence to our committee not surprisingly took a quite contrary view. In fact, the evidence from the Australian Education Union in Tasmania was particularly revealing. When I asked the witness whether they were aware that the 5,000 members of that union would have substantial tax cuts under tax reform, they said no. When I asked whether they were taking that into account in opposing tax reform, they said no. In fact, Ms Hull said:</para><para>We are taking that into account . . . PAYE tax people at present are already bearing a substantial brunt in relation to their tax contribution.</para><para>We agree, and that is why we are trying to change the taxation system to make it fairer for families and fairer for small business. That is why we want to legislate to give tax cuts to families.</para><para>It is quite interesting to hear members of the opposition criticising the government's 
 attempt to change the taxation system when in fact, after the 1993 election, the opposition when in government implemented its most disgraceful taxation changes of all. After promising no GST and after having been elected on that platform, in the 1993 budget Labor increased the rates of wholesale sales tax across the board. In wholesale sales tax revenue in 1992-93, they raised $9.2 billion. But, by the time they left office, they were collecting $12,955 millionâan increase of more than 40 per cent on their previous taxation revenue.</para><para>Where was the compensation then for low income families? Where were the Senate committees then, with their trade union submissions? Most importantly, where were the Democrats? Australians want tax cuts and they want tax reform.

That is the point I want to address today in taking note of the responses to questions to Senator Alstonâin particular, to the question I asked him. We have not got any answers. That is clear now, after Monday when he could not respond to Senator Cook but referred to the article by Treasurer Costello in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  and said, `There are all of the answers.' I have to say to the minister that, if they are the answers, the Treasurer says in response to a question he poses himself:</para></talk.start><para>So let's get the facts straight about what the Government is proposing.</para><para>The Government will be increasing pensions and other social security payments by 4 per cent from the day the GST commences.

</para><para>I asked a question of the minister today with regard to the clawback provisions of the amendments to the Social Security Actâthat is, 2Â½ per cent of the four per cent that you give them up front is taken back.</para><para>We then go to the government's position that is outlined in the ANTS document on page 56. It says this quite clearly about increasing pensions and benefits:</para><para>.	 a 4.0 per cent increase in the maximum rate of all income support payments provided to social security and veterans' pensioners, other social security recipients and students in receipt of Commonwealth income support, including additional payments and allowances such as Child Disability Allowance and Mobility Allowance;</para><para>.	 a 2.5 per cent increase in the income test free areas . . . </para><para>He says further down:</para><para>This represents an estimated real increase of $5.80 per fortnight in the maximum single rate pension and $4.80 per fortnight for each of a married couple in July 2000.</para><para>But the fact is that that is not the case and will not be the case. The government itself has set down in this document and in all of its statements that there will be a real price increase of 1.9 per cent.</para><para>But we know that the Treasury has acknowledged that it could be at least as high as 3.3 per cent, and others have claimed that the price increases could be as high as six per cent.

 documentation, in any statement by the Treasurer to which Minister Alston refers, is that you are going to take 2Â½ per cent of it back. You are not going to allow any further indexation increases until 2Â½ per cent of the four per cent you say they get is reachedâand it would appear that they get that up-front and forever. You have never told them that they lose 2Â½ per cent of it and they end up with 1Â½ per cent, which is less than the CPI increase that you have acknowledged yourself. So it is no wonder that the people, particularly the pensioners, of this country are so concerned about what this government is proposing. Not only does Senator Alston not know this but it is also the case for most of his colleaguesâthey also do not know this. That is why the minister went back to the box to seek advice from his advisers on the question I put to him today, which is a clear example of the person we now have as Acting Leader of the Government having no capacity to answer any questions at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>4032</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is one thing to take note about answers given about low incomes and erosion of pensions, if indeed that can be proven. It is quite another thing to make a gratuitous and unwarranted attack on a minister that we have seen this afternoon from three Labor senators, in particular Senator Ray, who I would have thought has been here long enough to know that that sort of gratuitous attack achieves absolutely nothing and certainly does not distinguish him in any way whatsoever. Why on earth would anyone believe that the public actually want to hear that kind of attack? What does it prove? It is not constructive, it does not achieve anything and, what is more, it distracts from a perfectly legitimate debate about the GST and about the tax package and about matters that are of vital concern to AustraliansâAustralians who want to know about the government's tax package and do not want to hear this sort of nonsense that has gone here this afternoon in the debate on the motion to take note of answers.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MURPHY</name><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name></talker><para>âWhat about the four per cent? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âI am glad you have raised that, Senator Murphy, because you really do not get to the point very adequately when you talk about the fact that there is no compensation.

When the income tax act was introduced in 1914, not everyone was better off. When the capital gains tax was introduced in 1985, the whole object was to make some people worse off.

When Labor increased all of the wholesale sales tax rates in 1993, the object was to make people worse off. And when you increased petrol excise it made people worse off.

I shall certainly try to do that. What is obvious if you really look at this package seriously is that most low income people, most of the people at the lower socioeconomic end of our economy, will be considerably better off with this package. In fact, it is worth recounting that with $13 billion worth of personal income tax cuts, $2 billion in enhanced family benefits and a doubling of the tax-free threshold for the family tax initiative people are going to be very much better off.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a very good deal for pensionersâquite contrary to what has been put here this afternoon. In fact, the Treasurer has very adequately pointed out that after the pension and other social security, indexation will be paid, so benefits will be 1.5 per cent higher than the full consumer price indexâwith no discounting. That is about as clear as you can make it. No matter how you want to twist it, no matter how you want to try to say it means something else, it does not.

It is far wider than the booklet which is the subject of this motion, because it strikes right at the heart of consumer rights in Australia at a time when, right round the world, consumers of all sorts of products are wanting to know more about the nature of those products and in particular about such things as their social and environmental acceptability. Indeed, President Kennedy in the United States spoke very strongly during his presidency, way back in the early 1960s, of the consumer's right to know, and this was one of the first matters taken up by the United Nations in debating the right of consumers to be informed.</para></talk.start><para>Ralph Nader, the great consumer advocate from the United States, stated when in this country that information is the currency of democracy. So what has happened to that currency in this case? Alan Gray and Anne 
 Hall, who are associated with the small <inline font-style="italic">Earth Garden</inline> magazineâwhich informs consumers right around Australia and other people about organic gardening and environmentally friendly ways to spend money and to develop your house and your farm and so onâgot together and produced a labour of love, this little booklet, which I have given to all senators, called <inline font-style="italic">Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</inline>. It is a very simple guide for those people who wish to be able to use wood but not at the expense of the wild forests and the wildlife which are part of Australia's heritage. On the back of the book it says:</para><para>Australia's native forests can't go on providing our building timbers without the threat of massive extinctions. The good news is that there are simple, attractive, ecologically-sound timber alternatives to native forests. This book shows you how and where to buy plantation-grown timber products, or superb recycled timbers, and how to feel good about your renovation, new home, or timber project.</para><para>You don't need to make your home a museum of rare timbers.</para><para>Australian companies have the products and the knowledge to make your home forest-friendly.</para><para>This book has said to the consumer, `Reject timber coming out of our wild forests,' in East Gippsland, in New South Wales, in the great forests of south-west Western Australia and in the world heritage value forests which are unprotected and the rainforests of Tasmania.</para><para>Most Australians would want to have this if they were buying timbers, because all the opinion polls show that most Australians are strongly opposed to the logging industry as it eats into these native forests and destroys the habitat of many endangered species and, indeed, many components of the wildlife that Australians know and love. I need go no further than to say that time and again in the Regional Forest Agreement assessments of the wellbeing of many important species logging was cited as the threat which put such species as the world's largest freshwater crayfish, <inline font-style="italic">Astacopsis gouldi</inline>, from Tasmania on the endangered list because it is helping drive that species towards extinction, both through the destruction of the food source habitat and through the logging roads reaching into 
 previously safe havens for this magnificent creature.</para><para>So there it isâa booklet to allow people who do not want to be part of that process but who want to use timber to get it from the alternative, which is the plantation resource industry in Australia. By the way, that industry employs more people than the native forest logging industry in this country. As the jobs fall off in the native forest logging industry, although they are cutting down more wild forests, the plantation industry is the downstream processor which is the job creator of the future in this country.</para><para>NAFI, the National Association of Forest Industries, representing the big woodchip corporations, moved in. It threatened legal action; it threatened an injunction. It said that if the book was not taken off the shelves, including the shelves of BBC Hardwareâa giant retail outlet in Australia which has taken this book to its heart and has taken out three pages of advertisements in the booklet as its endorsement of the thrust of itâit would take legal action. In the event, NAFI has done nothing of the sort. But what we have is a controversy, not about the book itself in the main but about the right of Australians to be freely informed. What we have from the loggers' representatives, including a reprehensible attack on this book by the now moving on NAFI head, Dr Robert Bain, is an effort to stop the information in this booklet going to consumers because the loggers want a woodchip forest; they want to make money out of our wild forests. They are leaning onâby inference if not by as yet undiscovered direct measuresâBBC Hardware and potential other outlets, including the Wilderness Society, whose shops around this country still stock this book where, due to their courage, it is selling like hot cakes.</para><para>What the National Association of Forest Industries and Robert Bain in his reprehensible campaign tried to do was say, `This book lies.' He has withdrawn that statement. He said it earlier, but he does not say it any more. I suggest he does not say it because he knows himself that he will be under threat of legal action if he continues that. So he goes on to say that it is misleading and such and 
 such. But when you get down to the points he is making, there is nothing in this book which he says is wrong which he can defend in his argument. It is a matter of opinion being debated here, not a matter of fact, as he says. He has a right to hold the opinions he has. Nobody has taken legal action against that. But the opinion of the authors of this book, and the right of consumers to take that opinion, is under legal attack and threat from the might, wealth and muscle, through threat and coercion, of the logging industry against the interests of the average Australian.</para><para>This is not the first time. This is the logging industry that set up the Forest Protection Society and poured millions of dollars into a front group, with the pretence that communities had got together to defend the right to destroy forests around this country. This is the industry which has threatened my colleague Peg Putt in Tasmania with legal action because she made a public statement that it did not like in defence of forests. This is the industry that had a spokesperson who told me that everything I say is put before a bank of QCsâa threat from North, the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere, to try to make me frightened to take part in campaigning. This is the industry that time and again threatens legal action, slaps on writs, and essentially tries to bludgeon its environmentally driven and environmentally responsible opponents into silence.</para><para>It will not work. I believe this action has blown up in the face of NAFI. I do not know whether that is why Robert Bain is moving on to the AMA, but I can say this: the Australian Medical Association should beware. If Robert Bain orchestrates through lawyers an effort to legally, and I believe fraudulently, try to silence opinion opposed to his in the woodchip industry, what are we going to see coming from the AMA under his direction? An effort to ban books on home birth, on euthanasia, on alternative health measures or on acupuncture because the AMA might not like alternative health measures?</para><para>This is an important matter. I know that future speakers are going to get up and say that this book does not meet their thinking. My challenge to the other speakers in this 
 chamber who take a different point of view and to NAFI is this: where is your book? The right action to take if you do not like this book is to bring out your own. It is not to try, through false, coercive and totally unwarranted legal bludgeoning, to deprive Australians of their right to know and to have a valid opinion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>4041</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tas</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFree speech is a treasured part of our freedom as a society. So when there is a matter about freedom of speech, I take some great interest. As with any other right within our community, there is a countervailing obligationâthat is, if you want to exercise free speech, you have to tell the truth. So let us consider this matter which talks about censoring free speech. But, first, let me advise that in 1996 I displayed a poster produced by the Forest Protection Society in my Parliament House office. Guess what? A Mr Blakers, a name well known to Senator Brown because a Margaret Blakers in fact works for him, wrote me a letter threatening legal action that if I did not remove the poster they would sue me.

But of course that was not good enough. Why? Because the poster was such a devastating revelation of the untruths being told by the Wilderness Society that they wanted only one thing and that was the removal of the poster. Anything I offered to do to remedy the alleged breach 
 of copyright was not good enough and therefore the poster had to come down.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Brown now has the expression on his face of the dog that hit the electric fence. Senator Brown, the people around you have been engaging in legal bludgeoning in exactly the same way that you are accusing the National Association of Forest Industries of doing. But let us deal with this book. On the very back cover it says:</para><para>This book is published with the support of the Wilderness Society and BBC Hardware.</para><para>We were told by Senator Brown that this book had been taken into the heart of BBC Hardware. Let us listen to what BBC Hardware has to say. A BBC Hardware spokesperson on 8 April 1999 said that the company had not authorised use of its name in the publication by the Wilderness Society. A complete untruthâcompletely deceptive, dishonest. It is a cruel hoax on the consumer, whom Senator Brown alleges he is somehow defending. In fact, it is unconscionable conduct by those who produced this book.</para><para>We then have, also in relation to this book, the assertion that a major sawmiller had broken ranks with the National Association of Forest Industries. They quoted one Mr Kim Booth, the former failed Green candidate in the last state elections. And guess why he is against native forest harvesting. He tells us that he is the largest distributor of Oregon timber in Tasmania. He imports timbers from across the world to sell in Tasmania. Of course he does not want our local forest products to be used. He wants to use those nasty imports, Senator Brown, that you continually rail against. When it comes to importing timbers or using Australian timbers, I stand on the side of Australian timber. It has also been alleged in this book that our forests are disappearing. The foreword says:</para><para>As Australia's native forests continue to disappear at an alarming rate . . .</para><para>What are the facts? According to ABARE, Australia's forest cover has been growing since around 1980. For the last decade Australia's forest cover has been growing and that has been scientifically shown by ABARE, an independent organisation. But when you are running an extreme green campaign you 
 never let the truth or the facts get in the way of a good story. Unfortunately for the Wilderness Society, on this occasion truth has come out and as a result a lot of people are now saying that they will not be associated with this booklet. Another example from the booklet is in the acknowledgments that appear on the front page. It says:</para><para>The following companies have also generously assisted with time and information:</para><para>Guess what the acknowledgments before that include. Margaret Blakers, a name I have mentioned beforeâan adviser to Senator Brownâand Senator Bob Brown himself. Undoubtedly he did assist with the untruths that are contained in this document. There are a number of companies such as French Pine from Tasmania which are deliberately listed in the acknowledgments. But what does French Pine from our home state of Tasmania have to say about this? Kevin French, managing director, said on 14 April 1999:</para><para>I wish to advise that at no time leading up to the publication of the above did myself or any other company personnel have any contact with the authors of this publication. We have not and definitely would not give support for a booklet of this nature.</para><para>And yet they quote French Pine as supporting these outrageous allegations in this document. Senator Brown has had the audacity to come in here and claim that he is somehow championing the cause of the consumer. He has championed the causes of misinformation, deceptive advertising and the misleading of consumers. He is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a senator.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4042</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have had seven minutes from Senator Abetz. We heard a constant tirade of abuse at Senator Brown and everybody else involved on the Green side of the debate. The one thing we did not hear was the defence of NAFI. Why not? Because their action was indefensible. In this debate on a matter of public importance we are talking about an issue which should be and is critical to debate in Australia. We are discussing another attackânot an unprecedented one but another attackâby this particular industry group and by Dr Bain in a debate which is of particular concern to Australians.</para></talk.start><para>They have attacked this industry group, this company and this book because NAFI did not like what its opponents were saying in the debate. They did so because they had the financial resources to do so. They are the two unavoidable facts in this debate. This is not the first time. Senator Brown has mentioned other occasions on which people have been threatened with legal action. In 1991 I, as Minister for Administrative Services, wanted to restrain the use of old forest timber in government constructions and I also wanted to restrain the import of rainforest timber. I was met with a similar sort of reaction from NAFI and Dr Bain. I got a letter from a solicitor threatening me with defamation proceedings. This is the way this person has conducted public affairs when it comes to this issue. In this instance Dr Bain has gone over the top and I think he has embarrassed industry because of it.</para><para>What actually was said that led to this reaction from Dr Bain? What were the actual comments in the booklet that caused such a reaction? There were five objections to comments in the book that were raised by NAFI's solicitor. One was a satirical comment by Mr Marr, who wrote:</para><para>Are you the sort of customer who strides through the doors of your local hardware store and demands, `Give me a 15-metre beam . . . and make sure it's covered with the blood of at least one endangered species'?</para><para>It was not a critical comment that was made in any other sense but the satire. NAFI then takes exception to the assertion that:</para><para>. . . half our forests have disappeared. Australia has the worst record for plant and mammal species extinction in the world.</para><para>Whether it is right or wrong, that was sourced to a document published by the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales in 1991. Does NAFI want to go back to that source and tell them that they should withdraw as well? The third comment, on page 10, was:</para><para>Less than 18 per cent of the average timber logging of an old-growth coupe in East Gippsland ends up in the sawmill.</para><para>Where was that from? It was misreported, but it was from the <inline font-style="italic">Statement of Uses, Resources and Values</inline>  put out by the Victorian state 
 government in 1993. Let Dr Bain threaten Jeff Kennett as well.</para><para>These are comments that are part of a normal political debate. As I said earlier, the action of NAFI was not just undemocratic but an abuse of power. We have here an industry organisation that is prepared to spend a lot of money to advocate its cause, but it was also prepared to spend more money to try to stop its opponents.</para><para>Whatever you think of the arguments in this debate, I think all of us would reckon that particularly community organisations should not be under this sort of threat when they involve themselves in this debate. What is at the core here? I think the proprietor of Timber Wholesale and Timber World, Kim Booth, put it properly when he said:</para><para>They've got no right to dictate to the public what they want to read.</para><para>That is the essence of the debate here and that is the point that Senator Abetz could not address and could not rebut. We are talking in this area of a long and ongoing debate in Australian politics. But it is not just that issue of logging; it is also that fundamental issue of consumer information that Senator Brown referred to earlier on.</para><para>This is not just the issue of democracy; it also reflects what I think is wrong with political debate on logging. What we should be getting here is encouragement of a relationship between industry and those in the community who are concerned about some logging practices and who are concerned about environmental and ecological outcomes. There needs to be more of this cooperative relationship between industry and retailers in a way that helps inform consumers. That is exactly what is going on across the world. Eco-labelling, consumer information and those sorts of initiatives are running worldwide. NAFI attempts to basically try and derail this particular initiative also poses problems because it does run contrary to what is happening in parts of Europe and North America and in other parts of the world.</para><para>As I said, NAFI's action is a dangerous precedent for freedom of speech in this country. It is an attack on freedom of speech and it is one that I am pleased to see there 
 has been a broad community reaction to. In response to those comments in the booklet, NAFI lawyers wrote to BBC Hardware saying that the booklet contained misleading and deceptive statements, and warned that they would seek a Federal Court injunction if it was not withdrawn.</para><para>The Victorian Association of Forest Industries, which claims to have led the reaction, is warning that the timber industry could actively campaign against the national hardware chain. VAFI head Graeme Gooding wrote to BBC, saying:</para><para>While you may gain some sales from `green' builders or consumers influenced by the misinformation in this book, you could lose as much in any backlash, if the people you are harming choose to campaign against BBC.</para><para>So we have the threat of an active campaign against a national hardware chainâa threat which Mr Gooding says would lead to financial loss.</para><para>It is no wonder that even Professor Alan Fels of the ACCC is investigating whether NAFI breached the Trade Practices Act in demanding that the BBC Hardware chain withdraw the book from sale or face legal action. I have not agreed with Professor Fels for quite some time, but I think his comments last week, when he dismissed NAFI's claim that the book contained deceptive and misleading comments, were pretty well to the point. He said it was pretty clear, as far as he could see, that the statements in the book were not actionable. He also said that any action to stop sales of the book based on alleged TPA practices would get a `frosty reception' in the Federal Court. I will tell you where else it would get a frosty reaction: it would get a very frosty reaction in the High Court as well. The High Court, over recent years, has entrenched in our constitutional structure freedom of political debate.</para><para>The law is one thing, but I am really concerned with the fundamentals of this debate. There has been an overreaction which does threaten free speech. The reaction of civil libertarians was to be expected, but the reaction of a broad spectrum of people is something that this Senate should note as well. NAFI's threats in this particular instance 
 got a reaction from Terry Lane, for instance, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline>. He, I think quite pertinently, says:</para><para>If the Trade Practices Act is used to stop evangelical greenies preaching their creed and fishing for converts, then it will be used against those who argue the ethical and environmental cases against eggs from battery chooks, pork from battery pigs, freeways through the forests, the eating of meat or the smoking of cigarettes.</para><para>The point he makes is that it will become illegal to advocate whatever your cause might be. If it is not illegal, then it will become a lot more difficult.</para><para>We should not underestimate the importance of financial resources in these sorts of battles. On the one hand, you consistently haveânot just in this industry but across the spectrumâindustries with resources to pursue their cases in court and elsewhere, and through lobbying exercises. On the other handâI will not say more often than not, but I think universallyâyou have community organisations and individuals who are prepared to stand up and fight for environmental and community based concerns. What we do have here is an abuse of power, stifling democratic debate. As I said, it is based on this use of resources to bring about the outcome.</para><para>We have had some interesting developments in this debate over the last couple of days. Again, it is worth noting that the National Party of Western Australia has taken a position which is quite different from the National Party in the federal parliament. Only yesterday, when the State Director of the Western Australian National Party, Jamie Kronborg, launched this particular book, <inline font-style="italic">Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</inline>, in the state of Western Australia, he said, `We're supporting sustainable forest management.' I think that is an act on his part that signals to the Australian government and to NAFI that maybe they need to pause in this particular debate and to take into consideration a broader spectrum of issues.</para><para>As I said earlier on, I think Bain's reaction was over the top. It does damage to his cause but, unfortunately for him and the industry, it does damage to the timber industry as well. We have had one speaker from the govern 
 ment, Senator Abetz. Probably more than anything that Senator Brown or I could say in defence of the booklet, Senator Abetz said it by not uttering a word in defence of the National Association of Forest Industries.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>4045</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the brief time I have available, I would like to indicate the support of the Australian Democrats for this matter of public importance. It is an important matter in the specific context of this attempt by the National Association of Forest Industries to censor free speech, to try to intimidate competitors and to try to ensure that information about encouraging the community to move away from native timbers does not get out into the broader community. The broader issue is one of intimidating anybody that tries to put forward an alternative point of view that might threaten the commercial position of a large commercial operator.</para></talk.start><para>The broader position relates to a specific piece of legislation which this Senate will debate when the government gets round to bringing it on for debateâthe Regional Forest Agreement legislation. This sort of action is a perfect example of the reason why we as a parliament at Commonwealth level representing the Australian community nationally cannot afford to sign away our legal rights for over 20 years to monitor the activities of forest industries. This sort of action shows the lengths to which the National Association of Forest Industries will go to try to protect their commercial interests. Yet here we are as a parliament being asked to remove legal protections for our native forests and to put them in the hands of organisations such as the National Association of Forest Industries.</para><para>It shows the sort of undue and excessive influence which can be brought to bear by large operators such as this one simply using legal processes to intimidate people who are trying to put an alternative point of view and get the facts out into the community. In this case they would seem on the surface to be fairly benign suggestionsâencouraging people to increase their understanding of alternatives for utilisation of timber in building, renovation and design. And even in a 
 case such as that we have the legal sledgehammer being brought down.</para><para>I suppose one of the positive things out of the action of the Association of Forest Industries is that the publicity has in many ways probably led to greater sales for the book that may otherwise have been the case. As often happens with attempts to censor what people say, the resultant attention actually raises people's awareness to what is being put forward than would otherwise have been the case.</para><para>We can see another example of that with the recent uproar amongst a small number of people about the film <inline font-style="italic">Lolita</inline>, which has led to it getting substantially larger numbers of people going to see it than would otherwise have been the case. I am not sure of the building links between <inline font-style="italic">Lolita</inline> and the native forests timber industry, but the issue of censorship is an important one.</para><para>I hope the Association of Forest Industries does rethink its stance on this particular issue. Certainly, from the Democrats' perspective at both federal and state levels, any attempt by large industry organisations to try to stifle alternative viewpoints must be opposed. I know my colleague in the Western Australian upper house, Norm Kelly, has spoken out equally strongly about the actions of NAFI in this regardâwith the Western Australian parliament and the Western Australian community more broadly being embroiled in the current debate over the regional forest agreements and the current threat to Western Australia's forests, which even the WA National Party have finally recognised are very much under threat. I do hope this federal parliament does not aid in the destruction of those forests.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>4045</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe arguments between NAFI and the book's publisher are basicallyâapart from the courtsâa matter for the ACCC. What we are really talking about are misleading statements contained in this document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Forest-Friendly Building Timbers</inline> . I support the industry's stance on this matter because it is just wrong to have statements such as:</para></talk.start><para>Australia's native forests can't go on providing our building timbers without the threat of massive extinctions.</para><para>This is just incorrect. That was on the back cover of the document. The facts are as the 1990 government study into ecologically sustainable development chaired by the Director of CSIRO's Institute of Natural Resources and Environment found:</para><para>There have been no known extinctions of Australian native fauna and flora species as a result of timber harvesting over a period of more than 100 years.</para><para>Another misleading statement is contained on page 10 when it says that less than 18 per cent of native timber logging in East Gippsland ends up in sawmills. The fact is that it is about two-thirds rather than 18 per cent. Again, there is misleading information in the document. A third example of misleading information is on page 11 of this document where it says, `It is a myth that Australia's native forests are managed sustainably.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âAbsolutely true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name></talker><para>âIt is absolutely misleading, Senator Brown. I quote the Resources Assessment Commission, which you are well aware of and which the Hawke government brought in to look at this question of whether forests should be conserved or managed on a sustained yield basis. That RAC report released in March 1992 found:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Inquiry is satisfied that currently the agencies have in place sustained yield management strategies for wood production.</para><para>It supported the continuation of harvesting of native forests. This document has misleading information in it, there is no question about it.</para><para>In the last few minutes that I have available to me, I would like to put on the record for the Senate and the community that the Howard government supports the use of sustainable forest resources through the promotion of the plantation industry and through the conservation of our native forests by a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and by ensuring that commercial management and use of the forests outside the formal reserve system are managed in an ecologically sustainable way. With regard to 
 plantations, the Howard government has been active in promoting plantation forestry. It has thrown its weight behind the Plantations 2020 Vision, which is an initiative of a partnership between the plantation growing and processing industries and all three levels of government in Australia.</para><para>This program encourages private plantation investment with the aim of trebling the area of plantations in Australia by the year 2020. This will involve planting, on average, an area of 80,000 hectares a year. Already we have seen the plantation average lifted from 20,000 hectares a year in the early 1990s to last year's figure, which I understand was about 50,000 hectares.</para><para>Other Commonwealth achievements encouraging plantations include progress on tax treatment of plantations and the removal of controls on exports of unprocessed plantation and timber. A positive example of the use of plantations is the announcement of the plan by Visy Paper to build a $450 million mini kraft pulp mill and paper mill at Tumut in New South Wales.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Brown interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name></talker><para>âCut it out. We are also encouraging our farmers to become involved through the Farm Forestry Program, through which a $7.8 million program has been provided this financial year from the Natural Heritage Trust. Farm forestry is the incorporation of commercial tree growing into farming systems, and the Farm Forestry Program has helped 190 national and regional projects.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Turning to native forests and the regional forest agreements, these are the agreements which resulted after the Labor government, over 13 years, desecrated the industry by favouring Greens against the forest industry. But in the end the Labor government was forced to reach an agreement with the states and to go through proper scientific process as to what parts of the native vegetation should be set aside in comprehensive and regional reserves, and what parts should be left for sustained yield management of wood and other products.</para><para>Whereas the Labor government failed to reach agreements, this government has gone 
 ahead with that process, and regional forest agreements have been set up with the states. Those regional forest agreements seek to establish a sensible balance between providing job and resource security for the industry and achieving a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of forest reserves. Prior to signing those agreements, each forested region was assessed comprehensively for all forest values, including wilderness, old growth, biodiversity, national estate, indigenous, social, economic and world heritage values. That was done comprehensively between the states and the Commonwealth.</para><para>The economic and social impacts were taken into account in those that have been completed. The Howard government has provided more than $50 million this financial year for ongoing implementation of the RFA process. Regional forest agreements have been completed for east Gippsland and the central highlands in Victoria and also in my home state of Tasmania. I have been supplied with figures by Environment Australia of the significant areas of forest added to the current reserve system by the RFAs.</para><para>In east Gippsland the CAR reserve system covers 514,000 hectares, of which 13,000 are an addition arising out of the recent process. In the central highlands, the CAR reserve system covers 297,000 hectares, with 116,000 hectares having been added. In Tasmania a remarkable 2.7 million hectares is in the CAR reserve system and 396,000 hectares have been added. The Tasmanian RFA included a Commonwealth commitment to provide financial assistance for employment and industry development. Funding for the Tasmanian RFA will total $110 million over three years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>4047</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen it comes to hardware stores, I have to confess that I am a totally frustrated, unqualified, do-it-yourself carpenter. I must admit I have wiled away many hours strolling through my local BBC Hardware store or the Mitre 10 store or Hudsonsâthese are not unpaid ads, I might say, but they are the stores in my area. I love nothing better than looking at all those wonderful gadgets and planning and thinking about those jobs 
 that I could do at home, such as building the pergola that I have been promising my wife for the last two or three years.</para></talk.start><para>I must say that when I received the booklet that was sent to me by Senator Brownâwhich has been endorsed, I understand, by BBC HardwareâI was intrigued. It came in an envelope from Senator Brown, and I thought, `We're in the middle of this big debate about regional forest agreements. Here's some more propaganda from Bob Brownâwe've got to take this with a grain of salt,' particularly after some of those terribly insulting things that you have said about us in this chamber, Senator Brown.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âWell, they were accurate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âThey were not accurate, and you know they were not. I will come back to that in a minute. So I thought that I should look at the document carefully, but when I opened up the envelope and glanced through the publication I thought, `This could actually be useful. This could be like one of the many brochures that I've collected from hardware stores on how to build a barbecue using only a bag of cement and a trowel and you don't even get your hands dirty, or how to build a bookcase, but done nothing about.' I glanced through it and I thought, `Yes, there is some very useful information in this booklet.' But I was also intrigued. Why had this come from Senator Brown? I looked at it closely. It is a very subtle and, I would suggest, a somewhat deceptive publication because it also pushes a very strong message on behalf of the Wilderness Society that not only should we be moving to greater use of plantation timberâsomething that I am sure we all supportâbut that timber from native forests is all bad and we should not have anything more to do with it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I can therefore understand why Dr Bainâwho has long represented the interests of timber companiesâand his organisation got a bit upset. But equally I have to say that just as we have extreme reactions on the environmentalist side of this debate, often represented by the views espoused by Senator Brown, we do get extreme reactions from the forest industry side. Unfortunately, on this occasion 
 that is what happened. NAFIâthe National Association of Forest Industriesâand Dr Bain did overreact. It is not as if they had not seen the sorts of claims that are contained in this book about the native forest industry before. They had heard those accusations for many years, and I agree that some of them are wildly inaccurate. So to take the step, as we understand happened, of putting pressure on the BBC Hardware company to withdraw this publication from its stores was, in my view, a major overreaction. I believe it did the association some damage and it certainly did not assist their cause of trying to promote rational debate and rational sustainable development of the timber industry in this country into the future.</para><para>So I do not defend the actions taken by NAFI. I think they could have just let this one slide through to the keeper. As I said, there is some worthwhile information in this booklet which I would suggest the vast majority of peopleâthose who visit those hardware stores, like I do; and I suspect there are many hundreds of thousands of Australians who doâwould be interested in reading. I can understand NAFI getting concerned when there is a page in the booklet which is headed, `We do not recommend use of any timbers or products made from native forests. Here is a list of timbers, products and companies to avoid.' And there is a very long list. If you followed that recommendation to the letter, you would never build anything out of timber in your life, because it covers just about every form of timber that is available on the market, other than some plantation species. So I can understand NAFI's reaction.</para><para>I also want to put clearly on the recordâbecause we all know this is a very passionate issueâthat, when the government gets around to bringing its Regional Forest Agreement legislation on for debate in this parliament, we will get a chance to debate those issues further, and hopefully in a more constructive atmosphere than we have in this debate this afternoon.</para><para>As I said, it is a very passionate issue. Extreme views, unfortunately, do exist on both sides of the debate. On one side, the conservation groups believe that there is no 
 other solution than to shut down overnight all operations with respect to logging of native forest timberâputting many thousands of workers out of jobs and affecting many thousands of families and many companies, particularly small sawmilling companies. On the other side of the debate you have the extreme views of those in the timber industry whoâand I must say it is a small minority these daysâdo not want to have any truck at all with any arguments put forward by the conservation movement.</para><para>But I have to say this to Senator Brown: in putting forward this matter of public importance todayâwhich we support in principle because we do have a concern about the attempt here to deny free speech, which is an issue that is going to be looked at by the ACCC, as has been acknowledgedâit is a pity that you do not follow that other legal maxim which says, `If you are going to complain about conduct, come with clean hands.' There have been actions taken by environmental groups, particularly some associated with groups such as the Wilderness Society, which I would suggest have been just as damning in terms of their attempts to deny free speech and to deny companies the opportunity to carry out their legitimate operations.</para><para>One only has to look at the campaign that was conducted both in this country and in the United Kingdom against Tesco with respect to the sale of kangaroo meat to see the damage that can be done to our export industry by totally unfounded, extravagant claims made by some environmental groups. It is a legitimate industry, and Senator Brown's supporters have totally ignored that fact and have set out with some quite untrue claimsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>âDo you want to ban their point of view?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>âNo, I do not want to ban their point of view. But what I object to, the same as you do, are the extravagant, extreme campaigns and claims. The point I am making, Senator Brown, is that if you are going to come into this chamber and complain about what NAFI does, then how about having a look at your own backyard as well?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will finish on this note. The important thing to remember in this whole debate is that 
 a process was set up by the previous Commonwealth Labor governmentâand it has been endorsed by the present government and supported by the state governmentsâto, over the long term, develop and maintain a sustainable timber industry in this country. That is of course outlined in the National Forest Policy Statement, which we are all aware of. A central plank of that is the increasing development of a plantation industry and a move to the use of plantation timbersâbut it must be done in harmony with the proper, sustainable use of native forest timber. 	Unfortunately, the environmental lobby do not accept the principle that the native forest timber industry can continue to exist along with a move to greater use of plantation timber. So I say to Senator Brown: whilst I clearly do not accept what NAFI did, and I object strongly to the pious comments made by Senator Abetz and his colleagues, have a look at your own actions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>4049</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âRight at the beginning, I want to say that I agree with a lot of what Senator Forshaw said, but I do have a real problem with having before us in this matter of public importance an argument as to whether or not NAFI or anybody else are using their legal rightsâa method of censoringâto protect themselves when they believe they have been misrepresented.

I have argued very strongly for proper sustainable development in our forests and at the same time for development of our plantations. If I have got time, I will come to our very proud record in Western Australia on plantations. But his inconsistency in bringing this motion forward and activities elsewhere I think is a blight on Senator Brown.</para></talk.start></continue><para>At our committee hearings in Melbourne for two days there were a number of attempts made by people in the audience, supporters of Senator Brown, including some of his staff, to intimidate witnesses in front of us, to the point that on a couple of occasions I had to call them to order and I had to ask that his staff should at least demonstrate that they know the way to behave.

I do not think there is really that much difference in the level of bias. What we as legislators have to do is try and get to a balanced position, and that is what the National Forest Policy Statement was all about. That was developed in 1992, when the now opposition was in government, with our support at that particular time. What the RFA process is all about is getting sustainable development in the use of our forests and, alongside that, developing our plantation industries.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to deal with the issue of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Professor Fels made some statements last week and was investigating this issue. I have a statement here that has been handed to me which I am prepared to table with the letter. It is from NAFI. It says:</para><para>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has not found any breach of the ACCC rules by NAFI in relation to the Forest-Friendly Building Products book. In a letter to NAFI today they have indicated there is no suggestion of any threats or implied threats of exclusionary boycotts by the Association. We have been told that unless anything new comes up there will be no more contact with NAFI.</para><para>I just put that on the public record. In my remaining time I want to put some positive things into the debate from this side. I want to relate what has been happening in Western Australia in the development of the softwood and hardwood estates. While I cannot go over all the detail of this, can I just say that from 
 1960 we have seen an increase in the national estate for softwood from practically zero to almost 100,000 hectares today. That demonstrates the developments that are occurring. When we look at what is happening in the hardwood estate, by species, age and class, we find that we have seen an increase from slightly more than zero in 1960 to in the area of 68,000 hectares now, and that is still growing. I understand from my colleague Senator Murphy on the other side that Tasmania can demonstrate the same sorts of figures in the development of the plantation estate.</para><para>While this plantation estate has been developed at its present rate, we will find that there will be an even greater increase in the utilisation of timber out of the national estate developed through plantations. This piece of paper I have got in front of me informs us that in Western Australia something like 200,000 hectares have been planted and that there is potential for about another 150,000 that can commercially produce timber, and that is growing year by year. This does not include any areas on private land where there is also an extensive plantation industry being developed. I think the context in which this matter of public importance has been brought before us is very unfortunate. I am looking forward to the day when we can actually debate the forests in a positive manner in this place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>4050</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn relation to this matter, it would indeed be regrettable if the legal processes of this country were being used to censor free speech. There have been many occasions when just such action has taken place. No matter how much that action has been permitted by the law, the intent of the action has been to censor free speech. The Labor Party is not going to support an action which is so designed. The best way to describe NAFI's actions in this matter is as ill-advised and as somewhat of an overreaction to a publicationâwhich has, in effect, given the proponents of the publication the opportunity to get for it some headlines and some promotion that they would not otherwise have received.</para></talk.start><para>If the intention of Dr Bain and NAFI was to stop the promulgation of the information in the publication, they have achieved exactly the opposite. To the extent that there is any censuring of NAFI in this matter, they are probably smarting more from their own misplaced actions than from any proposed censuring that might occur.</para><para>As I said, we do agree with free speech. I want to agree with the comments of Senator Crane, particularly arising from the legislation committee hearings into the regional forest agreements legislation. We were subjected to a process in hearings where we had, on the one hand, the proponents of the environment movement saying that we should be using no native forest timbers and that the RFA process was badâand we heard those people in silence. But when proponents of the sustainable use of native forests under the proposed legislation spoke we heard all sorts of comments. We had someone blowing some form of whistle during the hearings and we had sniggers and attempts to belittle the evidence given by witnessesâwhich seemed to me to be an attempt to somehow hinder those witnesses' rights to give evidence to the committee and an attempt to belittle the evidence of those witnesses before the committee.</para><para>In respect of the matter before us, what has been said, particularly by Senator Forshaw, is true: the environment movement does from time to time engage in actions which are contrary to the spirit of the comments contained in the letter, from Senator Brown to the President, that brings on this debate. Senator Brown moved a motion to congratulate the proponents of the publication, and that was the subject of a vote in this chamber. I do not in any way intend to canvass the vote other than to say that I regarded the third paragraph, paragraph (c) of the motion, as a paragraph which in effect was condemning the use of native forest timbers. I think the term used was `wild forest'.</para><para>The Labor Party did propose to the motion of Senator Brown amendments of this calibre, removing that rather one-sided paragraph and replacing it with the following:</para><para>(c) notes that the RFA process, initiated by the former Labor Government, promotes an expansion of plantation based timber resourcesâ</para><para>One would have thought that one could support that; but no, that could not be supported by Senator Brownâ</para><para>(d) believes that a balanced approach to forestry, including the promotion of the use of plantation based forestry resources will reduce pressure on our native forests, maximising job opportunities and assist in sustaining our forest industries.</para><para>Was that acceptable to Senator Brown? No, it was not acceptable, because there is only one outcome which is acceptable to the Wilderness Society and to Senator Brown, and that is the locking up of our native forests. The Labor Party do not support that. We support a balanced approach to forestry. We support both a plantation based forest industry and a forest industry based on native forests.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

We are, of course, very pleased that the Senate has supported the second reading of these important bills. We had expectations, particularly having negotiated and had the support of the majority of the Senate to sit during this special and extraordinary fortnight, that this fortnight would be devoted to debating these `a new tax system' bills. We were informed early yesterday afternoon, via the Parliamentary Liaison Office, via the whip of the Democrats, that the Democrats would not be able to commence debate on the committee stage for another week, because their amendments were not ready. We were informed yesterday afternoonâthat is Tuesday afternoonâthat they would not be able to commence the debate until next Tuesday afternoon. That is one week from yesterday afternoon.</para><para>We were flabbergasted. We were disappointed. We thought there was a clear understanding that this week would be made available for the debate of these bills. To be told, less than a day into that debate, that the Democrats would not be available to proceed with this debate for at least a week was an incredible announcement to us. In the time since we were told that newsâthat we consider extremely bad newsâwe have sought from the Democrats an undertaking that those amendments would be ready to go to the committee stage perhaps tomorrow or Friday. In fact the Democrats hadâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âPerhaps Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âWho would know, Senator Carr?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThat is the point.

I have asked the Democrats when they will be ready. I was given an indication yesterday afternoon that they might be ready on Friday but they could not be sure. Somehow the length of the second reading debate, because in the eyes of the Democrats it had 
 apparently gone fast, had stopped them from being able to do the committee stage on Friday. I am not exactly sure how. In fact, the second reading debate is one of the longest second reading debates in the history of this great parliament. It was longer than the native title debates on all occasions, longer than the second reading debate on workplace relations, longer than the second reading debate on all three tries at the Telstra bills, and it was just about as long as the infamous or famous, important debate that Senator Bolkus would remember on the political advertising and broadcasting bill, at about 14 hours or so. I am sure Senator Bolkus remembers it well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So it has been an extraordinarily long debate on the second reading. It has not been a quick debate, as some people seem to imply. Indeed, these bills have been before the parliament since December last year, so the Democrats have had four months to prepare their amendments and to have drafting instructions prepared. We would have hoped this delay was not going to take place.</para><para>I have moved that debate on the committee stage of this bill not commence now until Friday. This gives the Democrats the rest of today and all of tomorrow to try and get their amendments in order. We would have preferred to have started the debate today. We would have preferred to start it tomorrow. We are not at all happy with the concept of having to wait till Friday. It is fair to say, however, from my own bitter experience, that if you do seek to start a committee stage debate when major players in the debate are not ready with their amendments and there is not a comprehensive running sheet available, then the debate bogs down and time is wasted and the time is not productive.</para><para>So I have moved this motion. I have asked the Democrats if they will be ready on Friday, but they cannot give me any assurance. In fact, all indications are that the Democrats will not be ready on Friday. I hope they will feel some obligation to be ready on Friday.</para><para>I have also sought from the Democratsâand I have informed the opposition of this very candidly, and I do not expect them to support what I am proposingâsince we were working on the assumption that this fortnight 
 would be available for debating the tax bills, their support for extending sitting hours next week to make up for the time the Senate chamber will lose this week to consider these bills in the committee stage. I am still hopeful that the Democrats will see that there is some sort of obligation upon them to agree to that proposition. I have been assured by Senator Lees, and I accept her assurance at face value, that she is not seeking to delay these bills. But I have to say that assurance is undermined somewhat by their performance and behaviour.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Democrats senators interjectingâ</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âYou cannot come to us and say, `Sorry, you can't have extra hours to deal with the committee stage of these bills next week, even though we are costing you something like nine or a dozen hours this week. So if we need it, we will give it to you later, some time down the track.' One could only expect that, with four months to prepare their amendments, their bona fides have to be brought into question. They can resolve the question of their bona fides on this matter if they agree to the proposition that we sit for longer hours to make up the hours that will be lost this week. So, with great reluctance, I have moved this motion which would defer consideration of the committee stage of these bills until Friday 23 April.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4057</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis motion is not supported by the opposition.

The four committees of inquiry were established on 25 November last year. Labor had proposed one select committee; the government rejected that and went for a four-committee modelâthree committees chaired by Labor senators and one by a Democrat. To expedite the process, the first committee met as early as 18 December last year. Labor senators properly participated in a very gruelling Senate committee process. On the legislation, the Labor Party has assisted expediting the passage of two of the tax reform billsâ<inline ref="r697">A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998</inline>  and <inline ref="r665">A New Tax System (Medicare Levy SurchargeâFringe Benefits) Bill 1998</inline> âand they, because of the constructive approach of the opposition, were improved with opposition amendment and passed prior to the 1 April start-up date.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have been constructive. We are ready to deal with the committee stage of these bills and the government are not. I say to the government: join with the Labor Party, because you will get the numbers, and get the committee stage debate on now. The government themselves, in Senator Kemp's speech, circulated 128 amendments of their own to the bill. There is a question of timing here. We are facing a bit of an unreasonable legislative logjam in the Senate at the moment.</para><para>What you have to ask is: where has the Treasurer been in all this? Have Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Alston kept the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in the loop? What is the position of the Treasurer in relation to the consideration of these bills that the Treasurer claims are amongst the most important the Commonwealth parliament has ever debated in its history? Mr Howard and Mr Costello have demanded that the Senate get on with the job; they have demanded that we deal with the GST legislation. Apparently now they are saying, `That doesn't matter; we will adjourn these bills, perhaps to Friday, perhaps to next week.' They demanded that we get on with it but now they are willing to adjourn it.</para><para>The Senate was recalled for a two-week sitting period to deal with the GST legislation. And that is what we want to do. The government have simply made the decision, `We will avoid the debate.

Remember what the Prime Minister went to the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and said on 6 November.

Why aren't the people on that side of the chamber listening? Why aren't they listening to their own Prime Minister? They are flagrantly disregarding the views of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the views of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. According to your own Prime Minister, he obviously thinks that you are seeking to defeat what he claims is the verdict of the Australian people. We are entitled to ask the question in this chamber at this time: why is that the case? Why are you delaying a measure which the Prime Minister trumpets is so vital to Australia's economic welfare? Why are you, according to your own Prime Minister, delaying consideration of billions of dollars of personal income tax?</para><para>I have to say, and I am sure my colleagues know this, Mr Costello has not been quiet on this matter either.

Why haven't the Manager of Government Business and the abysmal and abject failure of an Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate told Mr Costello and Mr Howard about this? Why have they embarrassed them so much? Why didn't they tell them the risk was that they would say, `You want us to debate it, Mr Howard and Mr Costello, but, sorry, we are going to move a motion to delay debate'? Why didn't the government in the Senate keep their own leadership in the loop? This is the final humiliationâthe government proposing a motion not to debate the committee stage of the GST bills.</para><para>Remember the agonising debate in December. Who can forget them organising the extra time for the Senate to sit? I think it was an extra three weeks. The Treasurer and the Democrats spent hours on the shape of the GST committee process. It was agonising. Who could ever forget it? You had so much time involved in that particular exercise so that you could assure everybody that the legislation would be considered by the Senate by 30 June. The bills have been brought back in plenty of time to allow the government to debate them.</para><para>The buck and the GST legislation stop with the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello. There was all that hectoring and all that exhorting of the Senate by Mr Costello to get on with the job. John Howard and Peter Costello tonight stand exposed as hypocrites and incompetents. We have heard the Manager of Government Business blame the Democrats. It is the oldest political trick in the book. You move the 
 motion yourself to adjourn the debate and you blame someone else. This is not the Democrats' legislation, it is the government's, and this is the government's motion to adjourn the debate on this legislation.</para><para>I want to make it absolutely clear that the Labor Party will join with the government right now to bring on the debate on the GST in the Senate. We are ready to goâbring it on now. Don't anyone listen to all the weaselly, slimy, sleazy sell-out words of Senator Alston and government members in the Senate. If the government wish to proceed with these bills and if the government wish to have the committee stage of debate on these bills, they can. We, the opposition, will give them the numbers for this debate.</para><para>The Democrats are being set up as fall guys for the government. I hope on this occasion that the Democrats are smart enough not to be the fall guys for the government's incompetence. Peter Costello is in charge of the legislation. He wanted extra time. We gave him extra time, and now he has squandered it. He has failed to do his job. He and his coalition Senate leadership have failed the Prime Minister.</para><para>We do not know when the government plans to bring the committee stage on. At the moment we have a motion before the chair rearranging business so that these matters cannot be brought on until before Friday of this week. We heard, in the speech the Manager of Government Business made, that it might take longer. So we may in fact be aborting consideration of these bills until Tuesday of next week, possibly later for all the opposition know.</para><para>What is absolutely clear to all opposition senators in this placeâand what I believe will be clear to the Australian publicâis that the government has brought this absolute farce upon itself. Bring John Howard back now; even he could not do any worse. Perhaps Mr Costello can play a bit of a role in this. Let us sort out Mr Costello's dog's breakfastâbecause that is what we are left with. What we say is: bring on the committee stage now. We have had enough of this farce and this nonsense from the government after the Senate and the opposition have been implored 
 for so long to bring this debate not only on but to a conclusion. We are ready, willing and able to debate it now.

Let us look at the decision that was made to force us to sit right through Tuesday morning and then through Tuesday nightâsome seven hours of speeches on the second reading that should have been continuing now through tomorrow and into Friday. We had always intended to circulate our amendments on Friday and we will keep to that deadline. The only possible delay would have been a matter of an hour or two, brought about by the fact that we have one staffer working on the final amendments who is also required up until Friday to work on our committee report to have it tabled on Monday. The other amendments are in draft form, but those final amendments relating to the last committee report are now being drafted.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I say this to Senator Campbell, knowing that you have no cooperation on this side: surely it would be in your own interests not to force the debate through, knowing how few staffing resources we have, in order to put us in a position where, unfortunately, we have to say to you that time simply does not allow us, given the tabling of the report on Monday and with one staffer working on our final amendments, to have them tabled in this place in sufficient time for you, Senator Harradine, Senator Margetts and Senator Brown to consider them. We know what the opposition are going to be doing with them, but all other senators need to consider them so that we can have a debate that does not take forever with amendments that people have had some chance to understand.</para><para> I have to say at this point that, when we discussed with the government and indeed reached an agreement on how we would manage the sitting hours, we started off with 16 bills. We now have so many bills in the package that we have yet another report to write Friday week, particularly dealing with the wine billsâa very important industry that is not at all happy with what the government is doing. There, hopefully, we will see the Labor Party prepared to play a constructive role.</para><para>As for the bills we are going to begin dealing with, Labor have not indicated at any stage that they are actually interested in doing anything in the committee besides standing up and making a lot of hot-air speeches. Labor have moved what I take it are their amendments to the second reading. But, even if those pious amendments had passed, they would have achieved nothing. They would not see us with any improvements to this country's tax system.</para><para>A final message for Labor: if you do not want to be part of the committee stage, please let us get on with the job of doing the work we have to do in a reasonable time.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âLabor senators will cease shouting.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âAnd to the government I say: you have circulated 128 amendments today, and we also plan to consider those.

In the House of Representatives the opposition has put a 
 number of substantive amendments to the tax package. I understand that they included a number of amendments in relation to transparency in pricing, on which our office have been talking about Labor advisers. That means whether or not people, when they are looking at the package or at the changes that have occurred as this policy changes, will be able to find out just what is the actual increase in the goods and services that they are purchasing.</para></talk.start><para>We are left in a position now where we still have not seen any amendments in relation to such things as transparency in pricing. I do not know, and I have not heard in anything Senator Faulkner has said, whether or not we will see from the Labor Party anything akin to the amendments that Labor moved in the House of Representatives. This means that there is some confusion. I guess we may ourselves have to draft amendments which we thought or assumed may have been moved by the ALP.</para><para>The fact that this extra week was negotiated to give extra time for the ANTS package of bills to get through does not mean to say we will not get time to debate other bills. But the reality is we still have not seen from the government the total program they want to get through before the end of June. We have not seen from the opposition any interest in having a meeting to discuss the matter so that we know what the total program is that the government want to get through before the end of June.</para><para>The reality is that if we go on with other bills we are still progressing the government's programâwe have not lost time in the Senate if we go on with other bills. It is a nonsense for either side to suggest that if we go on with other bills that somehow or other we are not making progress in the program. We would like to see what the program is. What is it that the government want to get through by the end of June? It would be nice to understand what it is, the time allocated and how important the government see various bills, including the tax package.</para><para>The reality is that this is a very complex package of bills, but unfortunately we have seen great emphasis on only the economic 
 aspects of these bills. I call it the 40-minute clubâthe members of the Senate select committee who consider that the issues of the dollar economics are the real issues. Unfortunately that comes both from the opposition and the governmentâwe have heard today that the opposition wanted the Senate select committee to look at only those aspects of the tax package. The Greens and many people in the community have said that the social issuesâthe issues of education, community groups and the arts, and the incredibly negative impact on the environment this tax package will force on Australiaâought to be given at least equal consideration with the things that are visible in terms of dollars.</para><para>Unfortunately, the approach that has been taken here, with the opposition saying they are not going to participate in widening that debate, is going to potentially let the government off the hook on the wider social, economic and environmental issues and the issues to do with community. I am not entirely sure what the opposition's agenda is that they want to deal with it now, when their amendmentsâif there are anyâon transparency and other issues have not been circulated. Are they never going to move the same amendments they moved in the House of Representatives?</para><para>We have heard that there are 128 amendments from the government. I do think it reasonable that we get a chance to look at those. For proper committee process we ought to make sure that those people who are playing important roles in this debate have a chance to deal with this properly. Forcing a debate on any Senate when there are still uncirculated amendmentsâincomplete amendments for very good reasonsâis stupidity. I have always said that it does not progress the debate at all.</para><para>What we have seen here is theatre. We will not lose total time in this session if we go on with other bills. We will, however, still be left in the dark about what the government want to get through in this program. I suggest it would be in everybody's interest if at some stage in the next few days we have an agreement from all parties to have some kind of leaders' and whips' meeting so the govern 
 ment can put on the table what it is they want to get through by the end of Juneâso that we do not continually have these farces and theatre in the Senate. If we know what we are being asked to deal with we can make consideration of the debating program and, when we do get to deal with the important committee stage, we can do it in a state of proper preparation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>4063</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFrom this debate the first thing we can learn is that the sooner the war correspondent from Tirana returns to sort out the Democrats the better.

Senator Campbell has acknowledged that this is one of the legitimate tactics of the chamber, depending on your attitude to the totality of the bills. Senator Lees said we have done some sleazy deal with the government. I will tell you the deal we did with the government about speaking hours. It was very simple. We are here Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Because we are all here on Tuesday morning and our relative party meetings are not meeting, the coalition said, `Why don't we sit then and use the time?' We said,`Yes, why not?' We will all be sitting around waiting for 2 o'clock to start, so why not absorb the three hours? Is it a sleazy deal to agree with the government on that? And then they said, `Look. We'd like to move the second readers along. As they are a matter of no division and no quorum, why don't we sit on Tuesday night and get another two or three hours?' We said, `Fair enough.' And there are plenty of examples where we have done this in the past, no matter what side of the chamber we have been sitting on. It is not a sleazy deal to move the debate along, and that is exactly what we did. So, in 
 terms of the two major points Senator Lees directed at the Labor Party:  firstly, we did not do any sleazy deal over time and, secondly, we do have a rigorous contribution to make in the committee stages of these bills, and we are looking forward to doing so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What position is the government in at the moment? It has moved that the debate be adjourned, and we know the reality is that it is really adjourning the debate until Tuesday morning. A motion may say Friday but everyone knows that it is still  until Tuesday. The government says it is doing it in response because not all elements of the chamber are ready, but a good manager of government business would have found this out much earlier than Senator Campbell did. The political position we are facing is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are running around the talkback circuit playing the second oldest card in the bookâblame the Senate. The oldest card in the book is the state premiers running around blaming whichever federal government is in power. That is the oldest card. But the second oldest is for executive government to blame the Senate.</para><para>It was only yesterday that Mr Costello, that `Sydneycentric' minister, appeared on the John Laws program and demanded that the debate proceed this week and next week and be finalised by the end of next week.

Why couldn't they have got together?</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is the dichotomy that we are most worried about: Mr Howard and Mr Costello running around the country demanding that the Senate get on with the job, and Senator Campbell and Senator Alston basically saying, 
 `No, we will defer the debate until the following Tuesday.' You cannot have it both ways as a coalition. Why not bring it on for debate now? We are ready. You say you are ready, although we do not know. It may well be you are using the Democrats as the fall guys. Maybe you don't want to bring the debate on. Maybe you are still negotiating some other deals that none of us yet know about and you haven't consummated them yet. Maybe it is another Telstra bill. Remember how urgent the Telstra bill wasâhow urgent it was that we get to the second reading? That was weeks ago and it has not been brought back on. Why? Senator Alston has not been able to round up the usual suspects and do the usual deals which get sold out down the track. Maybe the same thing is happening with this matter.</para><para>One thing Senator Margetts said was interesting. She wants to know where the forward program is. Don't we all? No-one knows what is on the agenda, no-one knows what the government ask is. A broad ambit claim is thrown out there.

At the end of the day, much and all as we are disappointed that the Democrats have not been able to use the time between the last election and now to come up with all of their amendments, we do give them the benefit of the doubt in the sense that we know they do not have the resources of the trade union movement behind them and they therefore have to do a fair amount of the work themselves.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âThe hoary old chestnut.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âCome in spinner!

He has spoken for three minutes. You would have thought that with all his experience in this parliament he would have had a bit more to say than could be said in three minutes. What a miserable, mealy-mouthed performance that was that came from Senator Alston, the great champion of the lawyers' party in this parliament. What we have heard from him is gratuitous advice to the opposition. We have heard from him gratuitous advice to the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>Nothing could be more insincere than the proposition he has put before us today, because at core here we have the major problem with the government's legislation, a program which they have trumpeted up and down this country. Up and down this country they have said, `This is the most important legislation this country has ever seen.' We have been told that this is legislation that is immutable. That is the proposition that has been put to the people of this country. And now we are told that there needs to be more time to consider the amendments of the Democratsâamendments which you have already declared that you intend to vote against and have 
 already declared that you have no interest in. You have no interest in considering these issues.</para><para>The critical issue here about all of this is that you really need more time to get your deal together. The critical question that has to be attended to is that you have yet to organise the deal to put this package through the parliament. We say, of course, that this package is wrong. We say that a majority of Australians do not accept this package, that a majority of Australians understand just how wrong this package is and they demonstrated that at the last election. But you claim to have a mandate, you claim that this is the most important legislation this country has ever seen and you claim that this legislation is immutable. Yet you come in here with this mealy-mouthed nonsense that you want to provide more time for the Democrats to prepare amendments which you will vote against. What we have seen is a major U-turn by the government on this question.</para><para>I am perhaps a bit different from some of my colleagues in my perception of Senator Ian Campbell's role in this. I do understand the problem he faces. I do appreciate the difficulty he faces. Quite frankly, he is dealing with incompetents beside him in Senator Kemp and Senator Alston. He is dealing with fundamental incompetents. They do not bother telling him what is going on, and he is the one who has to come in here and find excuses for the incompetence of this government. We were told by Mr Costello only yesterday that the Senate should get on with the job, that he cannot understand why we need to wait another week, that this vote should be taken straightaway. Yet Senator Campbell is the unfortunate one who has to get up here and explain why this miserable, mealy-mouthed approach is being taken. Quite clearly he is at a loss to do so. I can understand just how weak his performance is, because what else could he do after so much has been made of this legislation by so many in this government with so little to show for it?</para><para>This parliament, we are told, has been considering this matter for 14 hours. We are told that there have been huge amounts of time spent in the committees of the parlia 
 ment, a select committee and three standing committees. We have been told that all this needs to be considered in two additional weeks of sitting. Yet we are told here at 5 o'clock tonight that we have to adjourn the consideration of this matter. After the consideration of a number of amendments which we have already put, a number of principal matters that we have already put, we are told that these matters cannot be discussed any more today. This is only after yesterday when we heard from Senator McGauran, who got a big run on the ABC news last night saying that this was a matter that the government was prepared to fight a double dissolution on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âWho said that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âSenator McGauran said it.

In a breathtaking act of hypocrisy, what you are trying to do is provide more time to stitch up your arrangements.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have demonstrated again is that the government seeks to blame the Democrats, and they are very easy to blame. You are only too happy to blame the Democrats when you get into trouble, and they fall into the trap every time of allowing you to blame them. One can understand why you used to call them the fairies at the bottom of the garden, the fruitcakes and the various other descriptions you have put on them. Unfortunately, I think their performance today does confirm some of those opinions that you have had of them.</para><para>We have been told that we have stitched up some deal with the government in regard to the proceedings in the bill. Nothing could be further from the truth. What we saw today from the Democrats was that they were the ones that voted with the government. It was the Democrats that voted with the government in terms of passing the second reading of the bills.</para><para>We had 14 principal amendments moved by the oppositionâ14 of them. What did the government do? They voted against them allâblanket opposition, as you would expect. What did the Democrats do? On issues such 
 as this proposal being an unfair tax that would see more than 50 per cent of benefits going to the top 20 per cent of income earners, and of it being a tax to benefit higher income earners which would far outweigh increases in social security benefits for low income earnersâproposals which would see the creation of a situation where people with no children and earnings of $100,000 per year would get five times the benefit proposed for low income earnersâwhat do the Democrats do? They abstain. What great principle; what a show of strength that was; what an extraordinary commitment to social justice was demonstrated by their abstention today!</para><para>On the issue of protecting retirees, what did the Democrats do? They abstained. On the question of defending Australian consumers and exposing the real impact of the tax on prices rises, the Democrats abstained. On the issue of defending small businesses, what did the Democrats do? They abstained. So I do not think it is appropriate for them to suggest that they are the persons of high principle and that they are the only ones that have an interest in social justice and equity issues.</para><para>What we have heard from Senator Alston, however, means that the government has once again demonstrated its hypocrisy. We heard only yesterday from the Prime Ministerâand it has been contradicted by Senator Alston, I might suggest, in his actions todayâ`I have said all along that we are not going to alter the essential thrust of the plan. What I will happily do is finetune at the margins but I am not going to alter the essentials.' Senator Alston would have us believe that there is going to be some consideration of the measures being presented by the Democrats. I suggest to you that nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>We saw Senator Alston in the Telstra debate, where he suggested that Senator Faulkner had acted in a way which was inappropriate and had indicated that, once you have the numbers, you just use them. Senator Faulkner did not say that. On the contrary, what we have seen in the Telstra discussion in this parliament is that Senator Alston has behaved in that way, quite clearly gagging the debate on Telstra and quite clearly using 
 Senator Colston in the most unprincipled of ways to secure the partial privatisation of Telstra itself.</para><para>I say to the Senate that this proposal is not about a proper consideration of the legislative program and it is not about an orderly scheduling of debate; it is about providing the government with more time to stitch up its deal to get this inequitable tax throughâwhich of course will do great harm to this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âThe question is that the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:30:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

It is a mark of the cooperation of the Labor opposition in attempting to facilitate the government's program, particularly when, as we have just seen, we should be dealing with the GST package. That is what we are here to debate. We have had time set aside, specifically these two weeks, and we have cooperated in extending time in order to debate the government's GST package, but it has just been pulled. We should be going into committee to deal with that very importantâone of the few points we would agree with the government onâpackage of bills. So the Labor opposition is being remarkably cooperative with the government in attempting to facilitate its program.</para><para>I can only reflect on the comments of Senator Ian Campbell, the Manager of Government Business, who castigated the Labor opposition a few weeks ago with respect to the second reading debate on the 
 Telstra bills. What happened when we got to the end of the second reading debate on the Telstra bills? The government pulled the bills. Likewise, what has happened when we want to get on with the GST legislation and consider that? The government pulls the bills, despite being here quite specifically to deal with the issues relating to the GST package.</para><para>I do not want to be too harsh on the government manager, Senator Campbell. We all know that Senator Heffernan is eyeing his job and that he is ready to take over. He is being trained because of the incompetence of Senator Campbell. We cannot just blame Senator Campbell of course. We have had a shambles today with the Acting Leader of the Government, Senator Alston, in the conduct of the Senate, not just with the GST bills being pulled.</para><para>For example, we had two government senators who were out to lunch early and missed the vote, so we had to recommit a vote on that GST legislation. Of course Senator Alston did not complain about that, because I can recall a couple of occasions when he himself has missed a couple of vital votes in recent times. And he is the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. I do not know what role Senator Kemp is taking in all of this. He is the Assistant Treasurer. We have very important legislation that we should be considering with respect to the GST package. I simply do not know what Senator Kemp is doing to assist in managing the government's program and attempting to get this vital legislation through.</para><para>The Labor Party is supporting the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999 . We have one very important amendment. I think this highlights yet again the positive approach that the Labor Party takes to genuine tax reform that is for the benefit of the whole community in Australia. That is one of the reasons we will be supporting this legislation.</para><para>The changes we are considering in this legislation fall into three broad categories: first, expenses associated with developing year 2000 compliance systems; second, minor or redundant software expenses; and, third, a new consistent regime for non-minor software 
 expenses. The first category relates to expenses associated with becoming year 2000 compliant. This bill will allow for an immediate deduction for expenditure in relation to new software or for substantially rebuilding current software to ensure Y2K compliance for an existing computer system. In relation to year 2000 compliance expenses, the taxation commissioner has ruled that expenditure incurred in initial work on computer software to determine the extent to which it is not Y2K compliant will be on revenue account, even if no further work is necessary.</para><para>Further expenditure incurred in modifying and testing computer software to make it Y2K complaint will be on revenue account, even if it also provides minor software improvements. Where expenditure incurred in modifying and subsequently testing computer software also involves substantial improvements not related to making the software Y2K compliant, it will be necessary to apportion the expenditure between the expenditure related to Y2K compliance which will be immediately deductible and the improvement expenditure which will be deductible over time.</para><para>However, Y2K compliant expenditure that involves replacement of the whole or substantially the whole of the unit of hardware equipment contained in a computer chip or firmware is of a capital nature. The government accepts the commissioner's ruling, but it is proposing to legislate to broaden the expenditures immediately deductible to also include expenditure on acquiring new software including upgrades, or substantially rebuilding current software which has the predominant nature of ensuring Y2K compliance, provided that it is incurred up to 31 December 1999.</para><para>The proposal to encourage Australian business to become Y2K compliant is sensible and it should be supported. There appears to the Labor opposition, however, to be a gap in these proposals. According to the proposed section 46(75), there is no scope for immediate deductibility of expenditure incurred after 1 January 2000. That expenditure therefore falls for consideration under the proposed new general rules and would generally be written 
 off over 2Â½ years. What the government is endeavouring to do with this bill is provide an immediate deduction for expenditure concerning new software where the purpose of the software is Y2K compliant and that capacity for immediate deduction will expire on 31 December 1999.</para><para>To Labor, this seems to be too short a timeframe because it seems entirely possible that problems which may emerge may not do so until that magical date of 1 January 2000âmidnightâand that, if you do get problems of a Y2K kind emerging on 1 January, these problems would need to be fixed immediately. We think the general regime for deductibility may not be adequate and that the provision for immediate deductibility would be the better way to go.</para><para>The government's proposed treatment seems odd to us because expenses related to developing software to overcome the millennium bug incurred after 1 January 2000 would presumably be urgent. Labor believes that we should be encouraging business to remedy any problems and that we should give them an immediate deduction for remedial millennium bug expenses until at least 30 June next year. We think it would be more appropriate that there be an additional period of six months for businesses to get an immediate deduction for measures that they have to take to correct this problem.</para><para>To the extent that these costs have been factored into the government's estimates of the general software depreciation provisions, there would be savings against the forward estimates as Labor's amendment simply brings forward expenses that would be claimed later. We will be supporting this measure with an amendment, which we will move in the committee stage, to allow an immediate deduction for the year 2000 expenses incurred up to 30 June 2000.</para><para>The second item in this bill concerns minor redundant software expenses. All items of plant and equipmentâfor example, non-software valued at under $300âare allowed to be fully deductible in the year of acquisition. The rationale is that it is not worth depreciating the minor asset over its useful life where its value is so low. Software will 
 now be treated in the same manner as other minor assets but bulk purchases of software packages summing to more than $300 but individually valued at up to $300 will be covered by the new depreciation provisions.</para><para>The bulk purchase rule could be easily avoided by purchasing the same software under different invoice numbers or at different times. Therefore, the legislation includes a multiple purchase rule so that an immediate write-off of expenditure is available only where the total expenditure on identical software in an income year is $300 or less. This measure will be supported.</para><para>The third item in the legislation concerns a new depreciation regime for software. On 11 May 1998, the Commissioner of Taxation withdrew taxation ruling IT26 which deals with the taxation treatment of software expenditure. The commissioner concluded that IT26 no longer reflects the correct application of the existing law in relation to software.</para><para>Without a legislative response, the withdrawal of IT26 would mean that systems and application software would generally not be subject to deduction or at best would be depreciated over 25 years. The government therefore announced an intention to legislate with effect from 10 a.m. Australian eastern standard time on 11 May 1998 the timed withdrawal of IT26 to provide for systems and application software to be depreciated at 40 per cent per year, that is to say that it will be fully depreciated over 2Â½ years.</para><para>The new arrangements are proposed to apply to expenditure incurred in relation to contracts entered into to acquire software after the withdrawal of IT26. It will also apply to expenditures on specified commissioned and in-house development of software commenced after that time.</para><para>Expenditures on in-house development or commissioned software commenced or contracts entered into up to that time will continue to receive the previous treatment until 30 June next year. Therefore, any such expenditures will be treated under the new provisions. These new provisions are as follows. All software purchases will be eligible for taxation amortisation over 2Â½ years at 40 per cent per year. That is the 
 general regime that will apply. The software is to be depreciated over that 2Â½-year period at 40 per cent per year. However, there will be exemptions. If the non-renewable licence period is shorter than 2Â½ years, then taxpayers will be allowed to amortise their expenditure over this shorter period. Taxpayers who stop using software within the 2Â½ years of acquisition will be allowed an immediate deduction of the unrecouped expenditure at that time.</para><para>Software purchases up to $300 will be immediately expensed, as I indicated in discussing item 2. The cost of commissioning software or developing it in-house for their own use will be capitalisedâthat is, it will not be deductible until the project is completed, at which point it may be amortised in line with the new provisions, ensuring neutrality with purchased software. But should the commissioned or developed software be disbanded, capitalised costs will be deductible at that time. Finally, the treatment of upgrades and maintenance will be in line with the existing application of the law for determining capital and revenue expenses.</para><para>Broadly, expenditure on enhancing or upgrading the functional capacity of computer software should be treated on capital account. Expenditure that does not enhance functionalityâsuch as maintenance, testing, code reviews, minor alterations, modifications and remedying defectsâshould continue to be treated on the revenue account. Moreover, systems software that has previously been written off as part of the computer hardware over 3.7 years under accelerated depreciation will not be amortised over 2Â½ years. The treatment of software that attracts concessions under other provisions remains unchanged. There should be advantages through reduced compliance costs of allowing expenditure incurred on software developed in-house to be written off from the year after it is incurred rather than being written off over 2Â½ years from the time each project is completed.</para><para>There will be special rules available for those who develop software. These taxpayers will be able to make a once-only election to pool that expenditure. Once that election has been made, all expenditure incurred in devel 
 oping software in an income year is to be pooled or written off at 40 per cent in the following two years and 20 per cent in the third year. There will be a transitional arrangement whereby taxpayers who elect to pool for the first income year after 11 May 1998 will be able to elect out of the pooling method in the second income year after 11 May 1998.</para><para>The government claims the write-off rate of 2Â½ years strikes an appropriate balance between considerations that software is an essentially capital expenditure which should be amortised for taxation purposes and the relatively short expected life of software arising from rapid developments in the IT industry. This does not seem to Labor to be a reasonable line of argument, but software these days does have a relatively short expected life. Labor also notes that this is a reasonable treatment in terms of overseas comparisons and international arrangements. Indeed, the proposed arrangements for software are broadly more generous than those applying in comparable overseas jurisdictions. For example, New Zealand allows software purchases to be depreciated at 30 per cent straight line or 40 per cent diminishing value. That is the equivalent to 3.3 years. The UK provides depreciation at 25 per cent diminishing value, equivalent to a six-year write-off. In Canada, software receives either a five-year or eight-year write-off period depending on the industry it is used in, while applications software is depreciated at 100 per cent, which effectively results in a two-year write-off period due to Canada's half-year rule. The United States provides a three-year write-off for newly purchased software unless the taxpayer can show that a shorter write-off is appropriate.</para><para>This measure is necessary to ensure that Australian businesses are not disadvantaged by the new ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation. Software expenditure is a significant and increasing expense of business and must have a reasonable taxation regime to ensure that Australian firms remain internationally competitive. As I indicated before, Labor will support the proposal subject to the amendment that we propose to move in the commit 
 tee stage, allowing the immediate deduction to be incurred up to 30 June 2000.</para><para>When we are talking about taxation arrangements for business, I suppose it is worth referring briefly to the fact that we have recently seen the second discussion of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. From Labor's point of view, as a matter of process, this is really the way that taxation reform ought to be undertaken, at least in its consideration, with the release of detailed options for public discussion before government makes a final decision. It certainly makes a stark contrast with the way the government has handled the GST package, and mishandled it in the Senate here todayâsimply dumping the GST package on people just before an election in a deliberate attempt to hide the detail under cover of a $20 million taxpayer funded, essentially party political, advertising campaign.</para><para>The Ralph team has produced a very lengthy and very detailed document. It deserves a considered response, and we certainly will not be rushing to judgment in relation to it. Labor agrees with the need for business tax reform, as indeed Labor agrees with the general argument for tax reform without a GST. We are prepared to give support with respect to business tax reform to those measures that come from that review where it can be demonstrated that those changes will improve investment, productivity and growthâadding jobs and strengthening industries rather than the reverse, as will be the case with a GST.</para><para>We will not, however, support in this exercise some kind of reduction of business taxation at the expense of individuals and families or anything which looks like simply dipping into the budget surplus. This exercise should not be about giving tax cuts to business while this government is on about imposing a 10 per cent GST on individuals and families. Labor certainly intends to hold the government to its promise that the business tax package will be revenue neutral.</para><para>As I said earlier, we should have been debating the GST package here. We have had somewhat of a shambles due to the incompetence of the government's handling of the 
 package of legislation. We stood ready tonight to debate the government's GST package in some detail through until next week in the committee stage, but unfortunately it has been deferred. For those listening, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, have been roaming the country saying, `Labor should get on with it in the Senate; pass our package, get on with it,' and when we are ready to get on with considering the legislation what happens? What has happened has been due to a combination of factors. Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, is away and we have the incompetent Senator Alston in his place leading the teamâsuch as that team is. Senator Ian Campbell is part of the team as is Senator Kempâthe minister who cannot answer a question and pads it out with ums and ahs insteadâwho is going to be handling the important tax legislation in the Senate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âIf we ever get to be asked a question.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âJust quieten down, Senator Campbell.

The first proposal is the requirement to depreciate computer software over 2Â½ years. Until May 1998, as a general rule software costs were deductible in the year in 
 which the expenditure was made, in accordance with Taxation Ruling IT26. In May 1998, the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Carmody, that expert on gingerbread men, decided that computer software should no longer be regarded as a revenue expense and consequently it should not necessarily be immediately deductible, and IT26 was withdrawn.</para></talk.start><para>For what it is worth, and with respect to Mr Carmody from the tax office, we agree that computer software should not necessarily be immediately deductible. We believe that computer software is a capital asset and expenditure on that asset should logically be written down over a number of years, consistently with the treatment of other capital assetsâwhen, of course, it is of significant cost. If it is not of significant cost then it makes no sense to proceed on that basis. We note, with approval, that software purchases of $300 or less will continue to be deductible in the year of expenditure.</para><para>Before I move on to the second proposal, I would like to comment on the withdrawal of income tax ruling IT26. Whilst we agree that the substance of that rulingâthat is, that computer software expenditure be deductible in the first yearâwas inconsistent with the treatment of other assets, we are concerned that when the ruling was withdrawn software costs fell into a tax black hole in this regard. This was commented upon in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> a couple of days after the withdrawal of the ruling. Appearing in the AFR on such a matter within such short notice of the change of that ruling is a sure sign that it has got up somebody's nose. That type of uncertainty and that type of interregnum between tax events can only adversely affect business. It is uncertainty which is entirely avoidable. It only requires communication and cooperation between the government, the tax office and the professionals in the tax business world.</para><para>The second proposal contained in this bill relates to expenditure incurred to cure the year 2000 problemâknown everywhere now as the Y2K problem. The Y2K problem can potentially affect computer systems worldwide. Sometimes I get the feeling we are 
 facing those kinds of `end of the world is nigh' cartoons, and nobody is quite sure whether this Y2K thing will turn out to be an interstellar explosion or a relatively expensive and short firework bang. But I agree with the government and I agree with the commentators that you dare not take the risk. It is for that reason that people are spending billions worldwide to address this problem.</para><para>It is proposed that expenditure on software incurred before 1 January 2000 will be deductible if the principal purpose of the expenditure is to ensure that an existing computer system attains year 2000 compliance. Obviously the tax office is not going to be able to run around and ask everybody if that is true. It will be a declaration of trust, I guess, by those who put in their tax returns. But that is typical of our entire system. Our tax returns are submitted on a trust basis.</para><para>This concession no doubt comes as a relief to business, which was facing the prospect of having to depreciate this expenditure on the basis of a draft ruling the Commissioner for Taxation had in respect of expenditure on year 2000 compliance. That draft ruling stated that expenditure on acquiring new software or substantially rebuilding current software would not be immediately deductible because it was capital in nature. The Australian Democrats support this measure and take the view that business should be encouraged by government to undertake preventative measures like this one by the granting of these types of event-specific taxation concessions.</para><para>Another significant event which may potentially be facing this country in the year 2000, and one which is possibly as significant as the year 2000 problem in terms of its cost, is the imposition of a new tax system. I would like to comment briefly on the potential for computers and computer software to significantly ease the burden of compliance with the GST event, should that event in fact occur, and for the possibility that the government may provide concessional tax treatment for expenditure, the principal purpose of which is to ensure that existing computer and accounting systems are GST compliant.</para><para>The use of computing systems would without doubt be one of the best means of 
 minimising the costs arising from needing to account for GST paid on inputs and having to claim those credits against GST payable to the tax office on goods sold. It is our view that the government should seriously consider the use of tax concessions like this one to encourage business to be fully prepared for this new tax system, just as it will hopefully be for the year 2000 problem.</para><para>The government's regulatory impact statement says that the imposition of a GST will cost a minimum of $1.9 billion to business. Frankly, that is a cost which otherwise they would not have to incur, and it is our belief that the government should review favourably tax concessions to deal with that very significant tax event which business will experience. The Australian Democrats believe that the government needs to use tax policy as a flexible device to assist business and that it should not shy away from event-specific taxation in that regard.</para><para>In respect of the government's amendments to the bill, which have been circulated in advance, we will be supporting them. I foreshadow that the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Labor Party amendment. The reason is that we believe the focus must be on preventive measures to address the year 2000 problems before they occur. This will not deny a deductibility to any subsequent expenditure; it will simply mean that it will not get concessional treatment and will not necessarily be fully deductible in the year of expenditure.</para><para>This kind of bill, this kind of proactive activity by the government with regard to tax concessions to deal with issues which are not the consequence of normal business activity, has to be welcomed. I think the government has behaved properly with regard to this particular issue and, as a result of this particular concession, will minimise potential problems which could exist in our business world, and indeed in the non-business worldâin the charity sectors and in the Senate, and for anyone else who has computer systemsâwhere the year 2000 problem might result in major problems.</para><para>I want to move on from these remarks to more general fears that I have in terms of a 
 coalition of events which may prove unmanageable for business. The first, as we know, is the year 2000 event. The assumption in the community at large is that, come the first week of January, everybody will breathe a sigh of reliefâthe planes are still flying, you can still draw your money out of the ATM, you can still go to the supermarket and use EFTPOS and you are safe. However, it is possible that year 2000 problems will continue in the months thereafter. For any business systems which do crash, those consequences could be pretty catastrophic and could continue for some months and result in a great deal of angst for those concerned.</para><para>To that potential event, we add the second potential eventâthe introduction of the new tax system proposals, particularly the GST, but also a number of other events. They are due to occur on 1 July 2000. So that is the second major issue that businesses have to face: having got through the year 2000 problem, they will then have to make sure their accounting software and indeed their systemsâand for many small businesses it will require the acquisition of hardwareâare ready for the GST. It is not as if they have a great deal of time to do that, because the ACCC is going to be pretty hot on their tails in the first month of July to make sure they are pricing their goods appropriatelyâtaking off wholesale sales tax and putting on the goods and services tax.</para><para>But hanging over all of this is the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. It seems possible to me, given the way the government operatesâand maybe this is so and maybe it is notâthat when the Ralph review is completed the government will examine the recommendations and will produce legislation as a consequence for us to deal with later this year. It is possible that the Ralph review reforms or changes will be geared to be introduced also on 1 July 2000 because it is the nature of tax legislation that the government does indeed try, as far as possible, to use financial year dates to kick in new tax legislation or new tax provisions. If you do that, and we have the year 2000, the GST and the possible Ralph tax changes, we are going 
 to have a lot of angry tax professionals and business people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âThey might be happy because they will be so busy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âYes, some of them will be happy, and some will be making a lot of money. But the fact is that, with regard to these issues, we have to be aware of the kind of stress which may attend all these changes at once to business systems and to the business community at large. If the government decides to pursue that course of action, and it mayâyou cannot do anything about the two events I have discussed alreadyâit is then incumbent upon the government to consider maximising the tax concessions which will allow people to lay off the costs which would arise from tax event-specific activity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This bill does not do that; it deals with the year 2000 problem and some other general policy approaches on the tax side. But if the government is in fact to continue a good policy approach here of being proactive in this area, then it may well need to start to think about that. It would be better, quite frankly, if that was known earlier rather than later, so that people buying hardware and software can maximise the benefit of the investment with a view to perhaps having to change their systems and so on.</para><para>Those I think are the simple things, like the discussions about how depreciation will be treated in future. As you know, most major organisations have assets registers. The assets registers are recorded in software packages. They are very much a part of the business systems. The assets registered are all computed in terms of the year of write-off. If the government decides to change depreciation allowances and when things will happen, then you have to change those software packages and systems.</para><para>Similarly, the capital gains discussion is very much in the news. If the government decides to put up legislation which, for instance, had a sliding scale in terms of capital gains, or if it alters the capital gains percentages or the time in which capital gains events took place, again systems will be affected. The software that is available is affected, particularly in major organisations. 
 You can imagine what a place like Lend Lease, to give an example of a giant company with extensive investments in property, assets and equipment, would have to do with their systems and their software if you fiddled with depreciation and capital gains.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âIt's the big bang.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âYes, it is a big systems bang, if you like.

I am no computer expert, but I am very certain that that kind of tax coalitionâtax big bang, as Senator Sherry expresses itâwould require some kind of special treatment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With that general admonition about some fears of what the year 2000 may bring to the systems engineers, tax accountants, tax professionals, financial directors and systems managers, I close by repeating that the Australian Democrats support this bill and will support the government's amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4076</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="r722">Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999</inline>  proposes to recognise the software expenses incurred by businesses seeking to remedy their year 2000 problem. There is currently quite a high level of confusion in the community about what Y2K actually means and what is involved in becoming compliant. Despite much of the publicity surrounding the year 2000 problem, it is not about the year per se. As we have reiterated in this chamber many times, the real problem is how computers have been programmed to read dates. Unfortunately, there is no universal law or ruling governing how we deal with the Y2K problem, so we have a rather ad hoc approach that by and large leaves the fixing of the problem to individual companies and governments seeking to take a socially and economically responsible position with respect to this issue.</para></talk.start><para>We find ourselves a mere 250-odd days away from the year 2000 and in a situation where some countries have done virtually nothing with respect to becoming compliant while others are inching closer to preparedness as each day passes. Australia is in a comparatively better position than most other countries. I am ever hopeful that the effects of non-compliance, which will no doubt be felt throughout next year, will be manageable. However, any disruptions or glitches or whatever will occur could possibly have been lessened had the problem been recognised and acted upon earlier, particularly with reference to the role that the federal government have taken in their somewhat tardy response to the Y2K issue.</para><para>There is a great opportunity for leadership on this issue and we stand generally in a strong position within the Asia-Pacific region. In turn, this places a great deal of responsibility on this country. This bill represents another piece in the jigsaw puzzle that not only goes towards raising awareness in the community about Y2K but also puts in place a practical mechanism to encourage remediation work. We saw not so long ago the passage of the so-called `good Samaritan' legislation through this place which in its way encourages the sharing of information about methods of remediation and preparing for the Y2K problem by using a mechanism of allowing more open communication and sharing of information about strategies and methodologies to enable companies to become prepared.</para><para>This is the real challenge that presents itself to this governmentâthis overall approach to preparedness. Just recently we saw the release of information by the government relating to their own levels of preparedness, which I will comment on a little later on. I presume that, in the near future, we will see some sort of public education and awareness campaign in relation to this matter to continue the work that has begun in the private sector of raising business and corporate awareness right across the board, to extend the same courtesy or service to the citizens of the country as opposed to our corporate and business sector only. </para><para>What we are really looking for, as we have with the coalition government through so many issues, is some decisive action. As I said, I am hopeful that this piece of legislation will also contribute to that jigsaw puzzle of providing a framework to allow the Australian community to be in the best possible position come 1 January 2000.</para><para>While over 90 per cent of Australian businesses are aware of the year 2000 problem, barely 60 per cent have taken action or intend to take action to fix potential problems. Of those businesses that are not intending or have not begun to take action, the main reason they have not done so is that they are unsure about what they need to do, according to surveys. A quarter of those businesses that do not know anything about it claim that they will not be affected, and a staggering 16 per cent are unaware of what the problem is.</para><para>Many Australian businesses and organisations are looking to the federal government for direction and assistance. Time and time again they have been disappointed with the level of information available. This bill will serve a dual purpose in that regard: not only will it provide a practical mechanism, or almost a financial incentive, for businesses to take on the challenge of proceeding down a path of remediation and preparing themselves for Y2K but it also demonstrates that there are costs involved.</para><para>This brings me to the issue of how government agencies and departments will fare. As we have seen by the report recently released by the federal government, the state of preparedness within the government's own operations is very disappointing. The point has to be madeâand the point is inherent in this billâthat remediation work costs money. It does cost business a lot. The 50 per cent of Australian businesses that have estimated the cost of Y2K compliance estimate that it will cost about $10,000 for each business. Even a similar, pro rata analysis of costing shows that it will be a relatively large imposition on government agencies.</para><para>Whilst we have seen the government allocate some funding through the last budget to be divided up amongst Commonwealth departments and agencies, surely questions 
 have to be asked about the state of compliance of those bodies. I will give examples of a few. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal lists their compliancy for business critical systems at zeroâ250 days from the year 2000. The Australian Customs Service is at 22 per cent compliance for business critical systems. The Australian Law Reform Commission is at 42 per cent. The most ridiculous and publicly well documented situation is that of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Artsâthe very department that has the Office for Government Online, the section within that department handling the government's strategy for Y2K compliance. A mere 36 per cent of its business critical systems is compliant. The National Science and Technology Centre is at 33 per cent compliance.</para><para>The record is not good, but the point is that it costs money. It requires a commitment to fix this problem. This bill assists business in meeting the costs of becoming compliant. In the preparation of this legislation, the government can learn the lesson for themselves that if you want the problem fixed you have to invest in its remediation.</para><para>The  Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  proposes to implement a series of changes to the recognition of software expenses for businesses by using tax concessions to alleviate the financial burden. These fall into three broad categories. Firstly, there are those expenses associated with the development of Y2K compliance systems. Secondly, there are minor or redundant software expenses. Lastly, the bill proposes a new consistent regime for all non-minor software expenses.</para><para>Following the ruling of the Commissioner of Taxation on year 2000 compliance expenses, the government proposes to broaden expenditures immediately deductible to also include expenditure on acquiring new software, including upgrades or substantially rebuilding current software to ensure Y2K compliance, provided these costs are incurred up to 31 December 1999.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>4078</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

I refer to a bank that was once known as the people's bank, a bank described by its founding father, Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, as a bank belonging to the people. Most of us have quite nostalgic memories of our little tin moneyboxes and our school bank accounts. In those days, the Commonwealth Bank was a community iconâa safe and secure repository for our savings and a part of the very important lesson about saving for a rainy day.</para></talk.start><para>Over the years, the bank has grown and changed, as indeed has the Australian banking industry. But always the Commonwealth Bank continued to be a bank for the people. In fact, in 1993 it claimed, very proudly in its annual report, that it operated responsibly `according to commercial principles with industry related performance objectives'. Its mission statement proclaimed that it aimed to be `a preferred provider of financial services to customers, helping them realise their goals'. However, what we now know is that the goals that could be realised varied from customer to customer.</para><para>For many of the farmers of Australia, those wealth generators of this nation, the bank had a policy under the high interest rates forced upon all of us by the Hawke and Keating governments. I have no doubt that those hundreds, perhaps thousands, of farm families will never forget the way the Commonwealth Bank dealt with their particular goals and aspirations. Right across this country the Commonwealth Bank sold up, threw off, evicted, auctioned, foreclosed and bankrupted hundreds of farming families. Their problem was that they simply could not meet the Commonwealth Bank's demand for payment.</para><para>Who could ever forget those televised scenes of forced sales with court officials 
 dragging families out of their farmhouses, their belongings callously abandoned and their dignity totally disregarded. Let us recall a couple of them. There was Oswald, a 70-year-old Victorian war veteran, who was evicted from his soldier settlement farm because the Commonwealth Bank decided to call in his $Â½ million debt which had accumulated as a result of floods, poor seasons and, most of all, high interest rates. Another was Robert, a farmer who borrowed $120,000, a debt which eventually blew out to $Â½ million as Commonwealth Bank interest rates reached 22 per cent. He was forcibly sold up by the bank when he was unable to pay the bank the demanded $275 a day required to cover his debts. So this was how the Commonwealth Bank helped those farmers `realise their goals', and there were hundreds more of those tragic stories across this country. But not for every customer.</para><para>The Commonwealth Bank provided special deals for some very special customers. This afternoon the Senate heard how the Commonwealth Bank did some very special favours for another well-known farmer, favours which enabled him to pocket millions of dollars when he sold his farm, even though his property, a piggery, was also in debt to the Commonwealth Bank. It was not hundreds or thousands of dollars in debt but in fact millions of dollars in debt.</para><para>Farming Keating claimed that his farm was a `first-rate asset'. We now know that it was not. I seek leave to table a 1995 report by KPMG, which in paragraph (vii) declared that the Euphron group of companies could only continue to trade with the support of the group's shareholders and bankers.</para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>âHow interesting that leave is not granted. Why don't these people want to know the truth about this matter? But the Commonwealth Bank came to the rescue for this high profile farming Prime Ministerâno doubt with its corporate mission statement in mind of helping customers to realise their goalsâand it was a pork-barrelling exercise that would do a pig farmer proud. In a deal that would sicken the stomachs of thousands of hardworking, honest farm clients around 
 this country, the Commonwealth Bank wrote off nearly $5 million of this pig farm's debt. I now seek leave to table a document which shows that in May 1994 the Commonwealth Bank did write off $4.9 million of the piggery group debt.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave not granted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âMadam President, on a point of order: I just want to put on the record that the opposition reminds government senators there are courtesies involved in tabling documents.

In doing so, it allowed the multimillion dollar purchase price to flow to Farmer Keating without any claim by the bank. In summary, this extraordinary write-off, favour, gift or special deal for the Prime Minister was worth millions of dollarsâin fact, almost $5 million.</para></talk.start></continue><para>To put that into perspective, that year the Commonwealth Bank wrote off $26.5 million across the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, mostly after the borrowers had been bankrupted and thrown off their farms. So Mr Keating's write-off accounted for almost one-fifth of the total debt written off, despite the fact that millions of dollars were on their way from Indonesia. There is little doubt that Farmer Keating was the only primary producer offered this gold plated financial deal.</para><para> But there was more. The Commonwealth Bank took a second dip into the pork barrel, and it was equally generous and quite extraordinary. Keating and his partner wanted to maximise their take-out of the final settlement of the sale of their shares and Keating's option to the Indonesians. So at final settlement over the Anzac weekend in 1996 the bank came to the party again, this time with a gift worth almost $4 million to enable a successful sale. The gift was in the form of a six-year, no-interest loan which the bank granted the Indonesian purchasers at final settlement. </para><para>On the same night that the bank did this deal, Farmer Keating walked away with more than $2 million as his final settlement. Not a bad consolation prize for a man who had been totally rejected by the Australian people only a couple of weeks before! Could any other of Australia's hardworking, wealth generating farmers get this special deal of a six-year, no-interest loan? Not likely. For the hundreds of Australian farmers who were thrown off their properties by the Commonwealth Bank, Farmer Keating's overflowing pork barrel must be sickening.</para><para>Recently, <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> posed the question of whether the bank and Keating conspired to blackmail Al Constantinidis to buy his silence about the piggery deals. It established that the bank settled its $11 million plus action against Constantinidis for $Â½ million. There is no doubt that Farmer Keating was a significant beneficiary of this decision, which until very recently bought silence from his former partner and, of course, was intended to buy his silence permanently.</para><para> So there we have it: a barrel of pork containing special deals worth $20 million. It is enough to make Andrew Fisher turn in his graveâ`a bank belonging to the people' indeed. Today, the Commonwealth Bank denied any wrongdoing, but standard denials by press release are no longer enough. The taxpayers and the farmers of Australia want to know why the Commonwealth Bank wrote this money off, they want to know who made the decision, and they want to know now. Pig farmer, Prime Minister, gold plated customer P.J. Keating must surely have been the only farmer in Australia who successfully and silently negotiated a $20 million gift from one of Australia's great public institutionsâthe Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>âMadam President, I rise on a point of order.

This week a great Australian, Ric Throssell, passed away in very sad circumstances along with his dear wife, Dorothy. Ric was known to most Australians as a novelist, and to Canberrans as a long time public servant. Even if Ric's service as a diplomat is not remembered by many, he deserves to be recognised for the loving literary portraits of his parents, Hugo Throssell, who was awarded the first VC at Gallipoli in 1915, and Katharine Susannah Prichard, who was one of Australia's most famous literary figures.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Ric was also closely associated with the Canberra Repertory Society as an actor, director and writer. His published plays, several of which have won awards, are <inline font-style="italic">Valleys of the Shadows</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Devil Wear Black</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Suburban Requiem</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Day Before Tomorrow</inline>. During the Second World War, Mr Throssell saw action in New Guinea. When writing his autobiography, <inline font-style="italic">My Father's Son</inline>, he vividly detailed the horrors of war. I quote: </para><para>The reality of war was different. It left no room for imagination. I had thought I could imagine what it would be like. The accounts of the hardships and heroism of men in battle in the papers at home had left me with vivid impressions of the horrors of war. I thought I knew.</para><para>It was not true! You had to be there.</para><para>No one could imagine the way war turned men into lumps of meat, the scrag-ends of flesh and offal in a butcher's rubbish bin; scraps for the dog. No one could know the tragic courage of men who faced that.</para><para>Having survived the horrors of the New Guinea campaign, Ric joined the Department of External Affairs, where he represented Australia in Moscow and Rio de Janeiro. But, unbeknown to Rick, even before he became a diplomat he was under surveillance by Australia's military intelligence.</para><para>As the son of one of Australia's pioneering communists, Katharine Susannah Prichard, security services had taken a special interest in the Throssell family and Ric was placed under surveillance by just about every security organisation possibleâthe CID, the CIB, Special Branch, Special Bureau, the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO. From all accounts it appears that in 1945 someone somewhere mentioned his left-leaning politics, and that this, combined with his mother's involvement with the Communist Party, made him a security risk.</para><para>Years later, when freedom of information files allowed Ric access to this information, the extent to which he was pursued, followed and hounded became apparent. Despite the witch-hunt, the security services could not find the `evidence' that they were looking for. Even the Petrov Royal Commission tried to besmirch him. All they achieved was spreading scandal and rumour with no evidence whatsoever.</para><para>Being the son of Katharine Susannah Prichard, a founding member of the Australian Communist Party, meant that a climate of fear and innuendo surrounded the family continuously. They were subjected to police raids and searches, telephone tapping, letter interceptions, document seizures and investigations carried out on their friends. Even though Ric was never a member of the Com 
 munist Partyâhe was a member of the Labor Partyâhe was pursued by ASIO relentlessly.</para><para>In 1953 they decided to interview him at the Hotel Canberra, and I believe ASIO's report is worthy of inclusion in this contribution. ASIO reported that `his appearance was most unlike what one would expect from a member of the diplomatic corps. He wore a cheap, badly fitting pale blue suit and he was not wearing a black tie.' Even though Ric was a career diplomat held in the highest esteem by his colleagues, he was denied promotions because he was not allowed access to confidential documents as a result of the persecution. In 1989 he published his autobiography, entitled <inline font-style="italic">My Father's Son</inline>, which vividly and quite emotively recounted how even those closest to him were prepared to participate in rumour spreading and deceit.</para><para>There was, however, a much more entertaining and positive side to the life story of Ric Throssell. He authored a wonderful collection on the life and letters of his mother, called <inline font-style="italic">Wild Weeds and Wind Flowers</inline>. He also edited two books dedicated to his mother's literary career, <inline font-style="italic">Straight Left</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Tribute</inline>. In April last year I was honoured and privileged to launch his novel entitled <inline font-style="italic">Tomorrow</inline>, along with a revised edition of <inline font-style="italic">My Father's Son</inline>. I spoke then about how his life had been one of tragedy, excitement and injustice. It was a life that was both inspirational and deeply frightening. At that launch, Ric paid tribute to his lawyer and to the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, for recognising that he had been victimised by Australia's security services, as they had published part of his story.</para><para>I would like to conclude by remembering Ric Throssell's contribution to Australia, and in particular his wonderful literary talents. Today I took some time out to revisit <inline font-style="italic">My Father's Son</inline> and came across this delightful and very poetic description of his first arrival in Canberra during World War II. I quote:</para><para>It didn't look much like the nerve centre of a country. Solid suburban houses laid out with architectural symmetry behind neatly uniform hedges, low white blocks of government offices planted here and there. Parliament House posed for its picture between a fringe of nonchalant lemon-scented gums . . . even the blue swell of the Brindabella Ranges on the horizon seemed to have 
 been painted as a Namatjira background to Canberra. The Molonglo trickled between poplars and willows.</para><para>I think this extract is a fitting tribute to a remarkable Australian who was persecuted for being suspected of holding different views and who enriched, throughout his life, the fabric of this nation with his outstanding contributions as a soldier, a diplomat and a writer. Indeed, in his final work, a literary work entitled <inline font-style="italic">Jackpot</inline> , Ric, oh so recently, has made another significant contribution to the social fabric of this country, detailing the challenges that so many Australians face with the personal tragedy associated with an addiction to gambling.</para><para>To Ric, someone I have known personally, albeit only so briefly, goodbye, and thank you for your contribution to this nation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Keating, Mr Paul: Piggery</title><page.no>4081</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>4081</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis afternoon, Senator Calvert raised recent disclosures about former Prime Minister Paul Keating. As Senator Calvert correctly stated, facts now in the public domain concern issues of misuse of power for personal gain, illegality, criminal tax evasion, gross impropriety, cover-up and lies. They also raise serious questions about the corruption of Australian federal institutions, namely the office of Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>This is far worse than Watergate, Profumo, the Monica Lewinsky scandal or any international scandal one might care to recall. Published statements and documents now on the record raise a clear, prima facie case of capital gains tax fraud by Paul Keating.</para><para>Firstly, there is a memo drawn up by Asian advisers to the purchasers of Paul Keating's half share of the piggery. This information is a record of advice from Paul Keating's lawyer, Chris Coudounaris, about how he structured the payment of $US6 million for Paul Keating's half share of the piggery to avoid possible political repercussions. The document is extraordinary. It clearly indicates an intent by Paul Keating to commit tax fraud while Prime Minister of Australia. The Gadens Ridgeway trust account statement, tabled last 
 year in the Senate, is evidence that this scheme to evade tax was, on the face of it, implemented.</para><para>The authenticity of this document has not been challenged. Furthermore, Al Constantinidis confirmed that the intent to evade tax by the scheme, outlined by Keating's lawyer, was coupled with an actual transaction as outlined. Finally, what Al Constantinidis told channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> was absolutely dynamite. Constantinidis said that $1.35 million of the $1.9 million that was injected into a company controlled by him to make it look as if it was an injection of equity was in fact paid to Paul Keating. As Senator Calvert pointed out this afternoon, <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> uncovered the existence of a second trust account document, detailing how $1.2 million of those millions were channelled to a Keating trust company. I seek leave to table this Gadens trust account document, which was in fact shown to members of the opposition this morning.</para><para>Leave not granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name></talker><para>âBy resisting the tabling of this document, Labor is showing it prefers ignorance and tribal party allegiances over truth. It is indulging in a blatant cover-up. Opposition leader Kim Beazley should show some leadership and agree to the tabling of the relevant documents.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, I wish to again remind the Senate that it is beyond question that the Indonesian purchaser agreed to pay Paul Keating $US6 million for his half share of the piggery. Keating told Kerry O'Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> last year that he got only a minority of that money. But Keating says Constantinidis got over $9 million. </para><para>In saying this, it appears that Mr Keating is counting as Al's moneys which were to be channelled through Al to Keating himself. As Senator Calvert said, if Keating applied the same logic to what he personally got to what he claims Al got, then he would be owning up to the following: that in 1994 the Indonesians agreed to pay him $US6 million for his half share and, according to Constantinidis, a further $A1 million for his option in 1996. This totals approximately $US6 million, or well over $A10 million. 
 Paul Keating could only have admitted to this if he had been honest with the Australian Taxation Office about his gains.</para><para>As noted above, when under pressure last year, Keating said he got only a minorityâthat is, less than $3 million. However, there still remains a huge gulf between Keating's admission of only a minorityâthat is, less than $3 millionâand the Indonesian agreement to pay him, in Australian dollars, over $10 million. <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> managed to establish beyond doubt that he received at least $4 million. It is time for Mr Keating to tell Australian taxpayers what he has done.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation Surcharge </title><page.no>4082</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>4082</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to draw to the attention to the Senate tonight a very serious and iniquitous situation that has arisen as a consequence of the Liberal government's superannuation surcharge tax. This superannuation surcharge tax was introduced in the 1996 budgetâthe first budget of the Liberal government. This new tax was introduced in direct contravention of the commitment given in the lead-up to the 1996 election by Mr Costello, the Treasurer, and Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, that there would be no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. Of course they tried to be half smart and called it a surcharge in order to avoid an accusation of breach of promise during the 1996 election.</para></talk.start><para>The super taxâand it is a tax, not a surcharge; that is certainly what the Senate called it in respect of an amendment that was movedâhas been widely criticised, and rightly, in the Australian community. I have spoken on this matter on a number of occasions. The so-called superannuation surcharge has resulted in a dreadfully iniquitous situation in respect of superannuation contributions of people earning below $72,000.</para><para>I have had my attention drawn to groups of Australian workers being seriously adversely affected by this new superannuation tax. I remarked earlier that it is almost impossible to find any respected, knowledgeable commentator, accountant, actuary, lawyer, economist or funds manager who supports this superannuation tax and the way it is being 
 administered. In fact, I do not know of any. Last year I had representations from two groups of workers at Pasminco's processing plant located in Hobart and their mining operation located in Rosebery on Tasmania's west coast. Both groups of workers had their superannuation guarantee contributions tied to a base earnings rate of approximately $24,900 per year.</para><para>In the case of both the workers at the refining operation in Hobart and the workers at the Roseberry mine, they earn much more than $24,900 per annum. The amounts vary according to their particular job classifications, but their effective contributions to superannuation fall below the current superannuation guarantee contributions of seven per cent by virtue of industrial agreements which apply at both sites which equate superannuation contributions to $24,900, despite that not being their earnings. Whilst this was to the advantage of those workers when the superannuation guarantee was introduced, with the effluxion of time and the increase in the superannuation guarantee to a level now standing at seven per cent, moving to nine per cent, such an arrangement is no longer to their advantage.</para><para>Through their union, the Australian Workers Union, which I might say is a union that has actively pursued their case, they have been seeking to have the base level of contribution that is included in the industrial agreements changed in order to reflect the seven per cent superannuation guarantee of the current earnings of an employee. The difficulty these workers face with respect to the mining side of Pasminco's operation is that they are receiving less than seven per cent of current earnings into the superannuation fund because of this formula. But the difficulty for the workers at the Rosebery mine is that, depending again on job classification, they earn, including overtime, between $68,000 and $80,000 a year.</para><para>If we look at the definition of income for the purposes of the Liberals' new superannuation tax, it includes salary or wages and it does include, for example, overtime. Whether or not the workers at the Rosebery mine operation are earning overtime, the fact is that 
 most of them do earn between $68,000 and $80,000 a year, and therefore a substantial proportion of them are required to pay the superannuation tax. Yet they are not receiving superannuation contributions that equate to seven per cent of their current earnings. This is a grossly unfair, unjust and absurd situation. It is a further example that highlights the difficulties with the superannuation tax. If there were some logic to the superannuation taxâand I do not believe there is, particularly in the way it is administeredâit certainly should not include overtime; but it does. Australian workers do not have superannuation guarantee contributions paid in respect of overtime, they have it paid only in respect of ordinary time earnings. So we have clearly got a serious anomaly that impacts substantially.</para><para>The other group of workers that has been drawn to my attention includes an electrician who I know is not alone with this particular problem. He earns substantially less than $72,000 and does receive superannuation guarantee contributions of seven per cent of whatever his earnings are from year to year, but those earnings are less than $72,000, excluding overtime. However, he does substantial overtime, and that overtime takes him over the $72,000 cut-off for the application of the superannuation tax. Therefore, he is required to pay the new superannuation tax. Again, he is receiving superannuation contributions on his earnings excluding overtime, but because he works substantial overtimeâand there would be many workers in this situationâhe is taken over the $72,000 threshold and has to pay the superannuation tax when effectively he is not receiving the superannuation contributions equating to that level of income. This is similar to the situation of the workers employed at the Rosebery mine operation.</para><para>I gave notice in the Senate of a five-part motion that outlined the particular problems that I have touched on only briefly this evening. It certainly was my hope that the government would support the motion that called for, firstly, changes to the SG legislation, to ensure that no employee receives less than seven per cent of their annual earningsâ 
 whatever that may be from time to timeâand, secondly, the removal of overtime from the definition of earnings for the purposes of a superannuation tax. Regrettably I have to say that the government, callous in its disregard for the application of a superannuation taxâand, indeed, for superannuation generallyâdid not allow that motion to proceed yesterday and to be passed by the Senate.</para><para>We know that Senator Kemp has proposed some further amendments to the superannuation tax or surcharge. It will be interesting to see if the government deals with this issue,  
 but I make it clear to the Senate that I intend to persist with it to see that justice is done for the groups of workers that are adversely affected in this way. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>4084</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.53 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4084</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>4084</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Navigation ActâMarine OrdersâOrders Nos 9-11 of 1999.</para><para>Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation ActâNotices of DeclarationâNotices Nos 1-3 of 1999.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>4085</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Former Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services</title><page.no>4085</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 204)</subtitle><id.no>204</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4085</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 24 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>Will the Prime Minister release the report prepared by the former Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services, which the Prime Minister stated he expected to "have on his desk" on 29 September 1997; if so, when; if not, why not.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4085</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>A preliminary report was provided to the Prime Minister on 28 September 1997 by the former Department of Administrative Services.</para><para>Further information was included in the final report which was provided by the Department of Finance and Administration (DoFA) to the then Special Minister of State, Senator the Hon Nick Minchin, in November 1997.
