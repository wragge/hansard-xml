This is the amendment to do with the government's attempt to reduce the total income paid to CDEP recipients who are also recipients of the parenting payment (single). I outlined the basic case last timeâI do not want to bore the chamber by going on 
 too muchâbut I want to come to the key point, and that is that I think the government's measure is one that seeks to reduce the income to 4,000 sole parents and, in large part, to Aboriginal sole parents who choose to work on CDEP projects as well. The measure would effectively reduce their income by up to $100 a fortnight and we think that is a measure that cannot be justified.</para><para>I know that there has been some reliance on the Spicer report into CDEP in terms of equalising conditions, but on my reading of the report he did not actually recommend this measure. I think what is more important is that we look at the key issue of the impact on recipients. The chamber would be aware that single sole parents in Aboriginal communities are among the most disadvantaged people in our society. A recent research paper by Anne Daly on the plight of indigenous sole parents and other indigenous families highlighted that indigenous sole parents make up 40 per cent of all indigenous families with children under 15. They support more children than non-indigenous sole parents, often without further income support because of informal or foster care arrangements.</para><para>Twenty-five per cent of indigenous sole parents care for foster children compared with 14 per cent for indigenous couples and just 9 per cent for non-indigenous sole parents. They have lower levels of education and are less likely to be in employment compared with other indigenous families and non-indigenous sole parents. Forty-three per cent of non-indigenous sole parents are in employment compared with just 25 per cent of indigenous sole parents. On average, they have lower family incomes compared with indigenous couple families and non-indigenous sole parents, while supporting more children.</para><para>So we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged people in society supporting children. The effect of the government's measure is, as I say, to reduce their income by $100 a fortnightâsometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit lessâall in the guise of bringing conditions into line. We do not think this taking everyone down to the lowest common denominator is justifiableâcertainly not in this case. I know the minister also 
 relied on the support of ATSIC and I understand that they have supported the measure on the basis of the package presented to them by government, which has other beneficial measures that I have conceded in terms of CDEP for Aboriginal people. But this chamber has to make the decision whether this measure is one that it wishes to support. I do not think there has been a cogent argument advanced for the chamber to take from these 4,000 highly disadvantaged people the income support that we are currently providing. We took that view when dealing with the youth disability allowance supplement the other day. I think that was the correct decision by the committee and I hope we will make the same decision here.</para><para>While bringing CDEP recipients into some sort of common arrangement, this does discriminate against Aboriginal people on CDEP in the sense that they lose their free income area as compared with other parenting payment (single) recipients. I do not think the government's justification is warranted. As I say, these are some of the most disadvantaged people in our society caring for children. I do not think we ought to be reducing the already fairly meagre income that they receive without a much better case being presented by the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>8591</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is probably one of the more substantial measures in the bill in terms of the number of people potentially affected. As often happens in this type of legislation, it presents the committee with a bit of a cleft stick situation. There is a significant positive measure contained in this schedule which enables CDEP recipients to get access to the social security add-ons such as rent assistance, telephone allowance, the health care card, et cetera, that other social security recipients receive. But, as Senator Evans has outlined and as these opposition amendments seek to address, the schedule also leads to a reduction in the overall total income for a significant number of sole parent pensioners or parenting payment (single) recipientsâaround 4,000 according to Senator Evans. If the minister believes that figure is incorrect, I would encourage her to indicate it. Those 4,000 
 parenting payment (single) recipients will be up to $100 a week worse off, which is not an insignificant amount of money for anybody, let alone somebody on a low income.</para></talk.start><para>Nonetheless, it is a situation where one would suspect the government's attitude is to present this as a package and put it as an `all or nothing' approach, which would mean that beneficial measures which would also make a significant difference may be lost. Rent assistance can be quite a significant payment and a number of people would miss out on that positive measureâI am not sure of the total number of people affected by that; I am sure the minister could outline it. So it pits one group against another, which is a far from ideal situation. But that is what we are faced with, so that is what we have to address.</para><para>I have a couple of questions and I would be interested to hear the answers from the minister, because they concern something I have been giving consideration to in listening to the arguments that have been put forward. Firstly, can the minister confirm the number of parenting payment (single) recipients that will be affected by the measureâwhether it is 4,000? Secondly, what on average is the total income of those people currently in receipt of the maximum CDEP payment and parenting payment on top of that? And, thirdly, can the minister confirm whether that does lead to a cut of around $100 a week?</para><para>I have just had circulated an amendment which is not on the running sheet. I take on board the minister's comment about late circulation of amendments in social security legislation, but these things happen sometimes. I foreshadow this amendmentâI may or may not proceed with itâwhich is an attempt at a grandfathering amendment to ensure that those who are currently under this arrangement would not be disadvantaged whilst meeting the long-term aims of the government of having a uniform approach to income treatment for CDEP recipients. This may be a way through the situation that we are faced with.</para><para>Whilst I understand and support the concerns put forward by Senator Evans, I am also concerned that the positive measure contained in this schedule will be lost, which is an 
 outcome I am not keen to see. I cannot recall if I have asked this before, but I ask if the minister could indicate the origin of this particular measure to do with sole parentsâwhether it was contained in the Spicer report along with the other aspects that are part of this schedule.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>8592</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI understand that the opposition amendments Nos 1 to 7 purport to reverse the government's proposal in relation to lone parents. If the opposition amendments were to succeed, the cost would be $6.102 million in 1999-2000, $14.92 million in 2000-01 and $14.92 million in 2001-02, totalling $35.943 million over four years. Four thousand lone parents would retain their current entitlements as a result of the amendments. On average, the loss would be $80 per fortnightânot $100 per week which I think is what Senator Bartlett said.</para></talk.start><para>I know that ATSIC has made it very clear that there is some resentment in communities that there is double-dipping by a protected class of people. Therefore, I fear that the attempt at a solution by Senator Bartlett would not resolve that problem, which is that it is seen as unfair that some people get two payments when others doing the same work do not. For my part, I am more concerned about the fact that women are often not considered eligible or not encouraged to be part of the CDEP projects when there are other people who are seen as more needy in the community in terms of income support. The CDEP money goes to those who have not already got income support, and one can understand the thinking behind that.</para><para>Senator Evans might like to take on board the fact that my advice is that opposition amendments Nos 9 to 32 appear to accidentallyâI say `accidentally'; I presume it is not deliberateâreverse the government's proposal to commence the CDEP add-ons measure with effect from 20 March. That is, they conflict with our requests Nos 1, 2 and 3 which set the new commencement date, and requests Nos 2 and 3 were already agreed to by the committee on Monday. I say that the revised 
 commencement proposed by the opposition appears to be accidental because they did not announce such an intention during the debate at the second reading stage, and it appears to be an accidental result of attempting to remove all reference to pensions.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Chris Evans interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âI am just giving you the opportunity to hear both, Senator Evans. In doing so, your amendments, in conjunction with opposition amendment No. 8, which we will come to shortly, appear to accidentally deprive pensioners of the entitlement to new CDEP participation. But I understand it also means that the net result would be that the scheme would come into effect on 20 September, which of course was the original date. But I understand that probably your drafting is defective. I do not think you mean that. I do not quite know how you want to resolve that now, but you would need time to take advice, I would think.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>8592</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate that the minister is trying to be helpful. My understanding of the drafting advice was that the revisions that I moved this morning overcame those difficulties and made them consistent with your amendments. I am not sure whether you are saying that the revisions that we just moved by leave do not do that or whether you are operating on the basis of the impact that would have occurred if we had proceeded yesterday. It would be helpful if you could clarify that.</para></talk.start><para>There is no intention to change any of your arrangements in relation to the timing of benefits. We tried to restrict the debate on this occasion to this question of the CDEP entitlements of recipients of parenting payment (single), so there is no intention to do that. I think you are aware that the complicated drafting required was requested last night to try to make sure that we had consistency between the government's amendments, which relate to the timing issues, and our policy intent, which is to retain that payment. As I say, I am not sure whether you are saying that the original draft failed to achieve that or whether this morning's revised amendments fail to achieve that. Perhaps you could clarify 
 that. But I certainly put on record there is no intention to change any of those entitlements. It was purely our intention yesterday to single out this area for question and debate and acceptance of what we saw as a necessary change to the timing arrangements because of the delay in the passage of the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>8593</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Chairman, I am waiting to receive advice on the opposition's amendments. I do not know whether they achieve a solution to the problem or not. I do not know how we can proceed at this minute without that advice. It is a pretty significant defect if it remains a defect. For example, we would have a great problem with the administration of Centrelink as a purely mechanistic issue which is not to be swept aside. It would mean that some of Centrelink's operations would require untested manual processes and things like that.

Also, advisers from the opposition met with her advisers yesterday evening to try to make sure that we did not have any unintended consequences and that we had an agreement that would isolate out this issue. So I do not think there is any need for us to debate this, other than the fact that we need to get it right. There are, though, substantive policy issues in debate here that we could continue with while we work out whether or not we have got the technical amendments on timing correct or not.</para></talk.start><para>I am interested in Senator Bartlett's contribution. I am not sure what his position is as a result of that, but I know he asked the minister a range of questions which he wanted answered, some of which I think she responded to. I am happy to have this debate about where we are going in terms of the principal issues, and we can come back to whether we have achieved technically what we thought we were going to achieve. But, as I say, I would be interested in hearing from Senator Bartlett what he intends to do. Is he proceed

My amendment attempts to try to find a way through the difficulty that is presented here in terms of not putting at risk the positive aspects that are contained within the schedule, which is, I suspect, what may otherwise occur.</para></talk.start><para> One of the questions I asked the ministerâI do not think she answered, unless I was temporarily distractedâwas whether or not this measure relating to sole parents was contained as a recommendation in the Spicer report. Another issue on which I would be interested in the minister's comments is in relation to the bill as a whole. There are a number of other measures which we have not got to yet in other schedules, some of which, without pre-empting the views of the chamber, may well end up being opposed and removed. One of the issues that ATSIC have raised with me is the issue of the positive aspects of this measure contained in schedule 2 actually coming into being. One issue is in terms of the bill as a whole and whether, if the chamber makes other amendments, the government would be of a mind to hold up the bill because of changes that may be made to other schedules as well. An indication of the government's attitude to that would be helpful also.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>8593</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn answer to Senator Bartlett's question about Mr Spicer, 
 I am advised that Mr Spicer made it absolutely clear in his report that double dipping should be ended. Going back to the matters I was discussing with Senator Evans, perhaps I should go on, Senator Evans, to draw your attention to opposition amendment No. 8, because it has presumably unintended consequences, and the measures that we were discussing regarding amendments Nos 9 to 32 are consequent on the outcome of amendment No. 8.</para></talk.start><para>My advice is that if amendment No. 8âthe next one on the listâsucceeds, the CDEP supplement will be payable only to those on allowance type payments. Presumably, that is an unintended result, as you did not announce that during the second reading debate. This amendment and others consequential upon it should be opposed. The consequential amendments to be opposed on this basis are the opposition amendments on sheet 1391 and amendments Nos 9 to 32 inclusive. My concern is that you would effectively be removing the $20 amount for people on pensions. I do not suppose you meant to do that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>8594</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhile Senator Evans is getting advice on that, I would certainly say that, from my reading of the amendments and the billâwhilst we are not actually debating opposition amendment No. 8, it is obviously linked to the ones we are debatingâit does appear to me that the minister's advice on her last comment is correct. As I understand it, if we knocked out that particular section, all pensionersâand there is a list of pensions there: widow pension, wife pension, disability support pension, age pension, any of theseâwould cease to be entitled to receive the CDEP participant supplement. That appears to me to be the consequence of that. That is something that I have concerns about because, as I understand it, the thrust of what we are debating here is simply the impact on parenting payment (single) recipients.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to make a point in response to comments made by the minister a couple of moments back in relation to women's participation in CDEP projects and how that may be affected by the various proposals that are 
 being put around. I would have thought that the foreshadowed amendment of the Democrats to grandfather or to protect current recipients would not have an impact on the problem of women's participationâif it is a problemâbecause these people are already participants in CDEP and, regardless of whether this bill exists or not in its entirety, one would assume that they would continue to participate. The issue really is about the treatment of the income support payments for scheme participants into the future. The aims of my amendment are to not lead to an income drop for those who are already receiving particular incomes and to enable the future structure of the scheme to operate in the way that the government intends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>8594</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think Senator Bartlett is trying to do the right thing by women in those communities. But I think it would be pretty ineffectual, from my reading of remote indigenous communities, where the labour market is pretty inflexible. The only source of income for most people in communities is either welfare or CDEP. Those people currently employed under CDEP in a remote community, where there is only so much work and not much change in the potential work force, are going to continue to get the work, and the people who are excluded now are likely to continue to be excluded if they continue double dipping. I think that the amendment, whatever it might say, would result in those who are being discriminated againstâif you want to put it that wayânow because they are already in receipt of sole parent income support continuing to be discriminated against in terms of getting a job with CDEP.</para></talk.start><para>I share your concern about these people, but I think the quickest way to have them share in the dignity of employment in indigenous communities would be to put them on the same basis as everybody else in their community. The resentment that is occasioned by them having two sources of income where other people do not would be removed. They would be competing for a job on a much 
 fairer basis with everybody else in their community. It is pretty well recognised by the indigenous communityâperhaps it was an unforseen consequence of some legislative effort years ago; I do not know the history of how it happenedâas grossly unfair to have one group of people in a small and close community treated so distinctly differently from everybody else when we are talking about the opportunity to have the dignity of a job.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>8595</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just want to address a couple of the issues.

These are the most disadvantaged people in AustraliaâAboriginal single parents supporting children. To accuse them of double dipping is an abuse of language and an unfair implication by use of that language. What we are saying is that these people receive, in addition, about $100 per fortnight for participating in work under the CDEP scheme to support their community. They receive the same single parenting payment that every other person receives. What they get by way of advantage for this alleged double dipping is $100 per fortnight in recognition of their sole parent status and their need to support their children.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I understand what the minister is saying, but I think the language ought to be a bit more responsible. It is not double dipping; they are currently entitled, under the provisions of government legislation, to that income in recognition of their status. Senator Bartlett, you ought to recognise that. If there is such a problem with these people getting access to the work force, how come there are already 4,000 of them in this situation? There has been no evidence advanced for the propositions that the minister puts to us other than that there is some concern and women are being disadvantaged.</para><para>All I know is that these women will be disadvantaged, from the day you pass the government's proposition, by $100 a fort 
 night. They regard that as a disadvantage to them and their children.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âEighty.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âEightyâit depends on the number of children, as I understand your brief, Minister. As I said to you before, single sole parent Aboriginals have more dependent children than most sole parents. So we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged people in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we do know is that this government measure will reduce the income payable to them. Set against that, we have the government's arguments about a level playing field and some concern about relationships inside communities. On balance, what is more tangible? What is more real? What is more tangible and real to me is their capacity to support those children and the income support that they receive. For us to accept that we ought to reduce that, we would need to have a fairly tangible and cogent argument putâand I have not heard it yet.</para><para>I do not consider it double dipping. We have considered that those sole parents in Aboriginal communities who volunteer to be involved in CDEP deserve that sort of support. We may well make a judgment in the Senate that they do not deserve that support. That is fine; it is a judgment we will make. What I say, on behalf of the Labor opposition, is that we do not make that decision because we do not think it appropriate or fair. To suggest that somehow this is causing enormous problems and that women are being prevented from participating is proved false by the fact that you have 4,000 people clearly in this situation already.</para><para>There may well be difficulties. ATSIC may well have concerns about how that is operated. But I also note that there are other implications for ATSIC. Senator Bartlett has already hinted at what they may beâthat this is a take it or leave it package. ATSIC's view may well be that there are a range of beneficial measures contained in this bill, but they have been told, `Take it or leave it'. They have to support all the measures or nothing at all. I do not know that, but I suspect that is the case. I suspect that influences their view. I suspect that is now starting to influence the 
 view of Senator Bartlett and the Democrats. Again, that is a political judgment for them.</para><para>If you look at this measure in isolationâwhich we need to doâand if you look at it from the perspective of those 4,000 single Aboriginal parents, there is a very real case to be answered. That is: why should they have their benefits reduced by a significant amount, reducing their capacity to care for their children because they will have much less income as a result of this measure?</para><para>I do not know about the grandfathering clause, Senator Bartlett. If you are not going to support us in opposing the government's measure, then I guess I would have to go with the grandfathering clause as the soft optionâthe second best alternative. But I would urge you to consider whether or not the minister has made the case for this entitlement to be removed and whether or not you really do think that these people are double dipping. I maintain they are not. Every other sole parenting recipient in Australia is entitled to earn an income up to those income levels if they participate in work. These people are participating, through the CDEP project, in work. Why should they be treated any less favourably?</para><para>You have the government saying, `On the one hand we want to have a level playing field in terms of CDEP but on the other hand we want an uneven playing field in terms of parenting payment single.' You can choose which level playing field you think is more appropriate. It just so happens that the one the government supports on this occasion saves them millions of dollars and disadvantages single parent Aboriginal families. I, on balance, prefer the other view. That argument has been articulated before.</para><para>In terms of the procedural issue that the minister raises, we think that our amendments achieve what we have stated to be our objective, which is that the status quo apply for sole parent pensioners and that they do not receive the CDEP supplementary benefit. We do not intend that they get an advantage from receiving the $20 CDEP supplement. We are saying that we want to exclude them from that on the basis that they retain the status quo. That was the intention of those amend 
 ments. I am happy to enter into discussions with your officers if they say that is not achieved. We were not seeking to delay the payment of that to other groups and we were not seeking to further benefit those who receive a parenting payment single. That was the intention. I think you said that was what we were doing. If that is the case, I agree.</para><para>I note there is some excitement among the many advisers you have here today.

That is no slur on the advisers present. As I said, our intention and the drafting instructions to the clerks were that the amendments be drafted so that the status quo applied to those in receipt of parent payment single, that the other measures the government announced proceeded as planned and that the changes you wanted in terms of timing proceeded as you intended. I think I have made that perfectly clear. We are not arguing about a policy issue there, so I hope we can just get to what we think we are achieving and resolve it.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>8596</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is getting harder to resolve, because Labor's amendments would actually introduce double dipping for pensioners who were joining CDEP in the futureâbecause the CDEP scheme is being opened up to all pensioners from 20 March next year. In other words, the double amount of assistance that single parents are getting now would become the norm for all pensioners from 20 March next year. Whether that is what you intended or not, that is what is going to happen as a result. I am fascinated that you are prepared to countenance double dipping but you are not prepared to countenance triple dipping. Well done! You are moving! The add-on of the $20 would obviously mean triple dipping, in your eyes.</para></talk.start><para>Essentially what we are dealing with here is the unintended consequence of the conver

We have got a group of people who have entitlement to two lots of assistance from the taxpayer. Nobody else in Australia has that. I particularly wanted you to hear me to the end of this answer, and then perhaps Senator Bartlett might have something to say, and that will give you the chance to get some advice.</para><para>It is not just bureaucrats in ATSIC who believe this needs fixing.

It is not a question of the bureaucrats in ATSIC. It is the board of ATSIC that has wanted to see this ended and the new scheme introduced. If there is anything that the Labor Party has talked about over the years, it is the need to listen to indigenous people's views on their futures. This is a clear case where the Labor Party is prepared to ignore that advice.</para><para>Our government has been particularly concerned about sole parents in indigenous communities. Our government has put a massive effort in already, and is continuing 
 to, in order to do something about the terrible domestic violence in indigenous communities which leads so often to sole parenthood. So do not accuse us of not having the concerns of sole parents in indigenous communities at heart. We are actually trying to make a difference. We are making a massive effort in this. That violence is something that have I watched grow in indigenous communities around Central and Northern Australia and North Queensland over the time that you were in government.</para><para>It is now time that the women in those communities were listened to, and this government has been listening to them and involving them in consultations about how best to deal with this scourge in their community. You might have had a darned sight fewer sole parents if that had been done earlier. It makes me very cross to think of the wasted lives, the damaged bodies, the children scarred psychologically and the continuation of the cycle of domestic violence in those communitiesâa cycle which could have been stopped earlier or could have been prevented.</para><para>If you really care about sole parents, support the government's endeavours in that and do not try a cheap shot about whether we have concern for some of the most deprived people in our society: we do have. Their lives are vital, as well as this double income support which they are getting from the federal taxpayer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>8597</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should put on the record in perhaps a bit more detail the Democrats' beliefs in relation to this area and also some of the philosophical points that have come up, just to ensure that they are clearly on the record. Firstly, whilst I understand the minister's argument, I do think that the phrase `double dipping' is a pejorative one which implies some sort of inappropriate motive on the part of the recipient. I am not saying that the minister believes that, but I do think that in this area of welfare payments there is often a lot of potential community negativity that is able to be tapped into in relation to welfare recipients and that it is best to avoid language that might play on that by implying some inappropriate motive on behaviour. This is 
 clearly a legitimate entitlement that people currently have, and these are not wealthy people, by any stretch of the imaginationâas Senator Evans has outlined.</para></talk.start><para>The minister, in responding to some aspects of the opposition's amendments, talked about the cost if they were passed. I think it was $14 million a year, roughly, in a couple of years time. As I say repeatedly with regard to social security legislation, I am certainly not of the view that it is not important to try to limit government expenditure and to try to save government money where appropriate. But it is important to emphasise that, when we are using figures like those, it is not just a matter of saving taxpayers $14 million or whatever the amount of money is but that it also means $14 million is not been provided to people who are, generally speaking, amongst the most disadvantaged. If you put it in that context, it takes on quite a different light: it is $14 million of assistance that would otherwise be provided to disadvantaged people but that will not be provided. Again, it is important in terms of the issue of language.</para><para>The comments that Senator Evans was making about the different choices of level playing field also need noting and responding to. Again, I quite understand the rationale of what he is putting forward but, if you were to extend that logic fully, then the opposition would really need to extend the current income treatment that sole parents receive to all other income support payments in relation to CDEP. If it is a philosophical or an ideological principle, then it would make sense for it to apply across the board rather than to just one group of people. I know that the amendments are not seeking to do that but, if we are following through that principle, we would need to do that; and I do not think that anyone is suggesting that we should do that.</para><para>I do think it is appropriate that there be consistency of treatment. I have spoken many times about the need for a consistent approach, the removal of anomalies and the simplification of the Social Security Act. I have also spoken many times about how we should not do that in a way that reduces people's entitlements rather than increases 
 them. This clearly is a situation where, for whatever historical reason it appeared, CDEP income for sole parents is treated in a way that is different to any other social security recipient. That is clearly an anomaly.</para><para>I note the specific statements of ATSIC chairman, Gatjil Djerrkuraâa person for whom I have a lot of respectâon the treatment of sole parents receiving a pension like payment. That is something that does need to be taken on board. Nonetheless, I come back to the basic point that I have continued to try to make on this issue which is that those sorts of principles are important, budgetary expenditure is important, consistency of treatment is important and simplified acts is important, but we also need to remember that we are talking about people here. We need to try to ensure that we are not disadvantaging people, particularly people who are already amongst the least well off. That is the particular rationale behind the foreshadowed amendment of the Democrats.</para><para>There are a couple of other points I would like to make. Firstly, I point out to Senator Evans that amendment No. 8, which is to oppose section 1188D, still reads to me like it will affect a whole group of people rather than just parenting payment (single) which, from my understanding of his comments, is not the intent.</para><para>Secondly, in response to the minister's comments about the resentment that may be out in the community towards the perceived special treatment of some sole parents, I do not know how strong that is. I guess that is one of the things you cannot quantify. The discussions I have had with ATSIC people do not recall that being raised as an issue. One thing you can quantify is that these women will be $80 a fortnight worse off. When you are balancing up whether you want to be $80 a week worse off but perhaps have a little less perceived resentment in the community, I imagine most people would prefer to keep their $80 a fortnight unless that resentment is completely overpowering. I have certainly had no evidence at all that that is the case. I do not accept that as an argument in itself for significantly reducing the entitlements of 
 people who are currently receiving these payments.</para><para>As Senator Evans pointed out, if there was some problems with these women being able to access employment through CDEP because of this treatment then there would not be 4,000 currently in this situation. That may be a problem that is stopping others getting in, but it is certainly not stopping the 4,000 that are already there. Again, I do not see that as a valid argument.</para><para>To put on the record the Democrats' response to these amendments, the view I have formed after listening to the various arguments that have been put forward and the responses to those is that the best course of action from the Democrats' point of view is not to support the opposition amendments at present, unless Senator Evans comes up with a stunningly brilliant contribution in a few seconds time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>âAgain.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âYet another one, yes. I do believe, nonetheless, that it is important to try to ensure that these 4,000 peopleâI presume they are predominantly womenâare not disadvantaged by this change and do not have a significant drop in their existing income in a few months time. For that reason, I hope that the Senate will consider giving support to the amendment I have foreshadowed.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>8599</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to speak to the opposition amendments. In doing so, I will go through a few issues that I believe are very pertinent to CDEP in North Queensland. I believe the program was trialled in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. There are areas where it is functioning very well to the benefit of the communities.</para></talk.start><para>In North Queensland it would appear, after having actually spent time in the communities discussing the issue, to have a downside that I do not believe was perceived or intended by the people who passed the original legislation and established the scheme. In North Queensland the CDEP is referred to as sit down pay. It has introduced a mentality into the communities whereby people no longer believe that 
 they need to go out and work on the stations or, for that matter, in the programs that are being established by their own councils. They merely say, `We sit home and get paid as well.'</para><para>There appears to be a lack of actual contact with the people in the communities by the people who are progressing both the legislation and the schemes. If you go into a local communityâsay, Pormpuraaw, and I have actually been thereâthe local people will pay $250 for a slab. You say, `What is a slab?' A slab is a carton of beer. That can actually be purchased in either Chillagoe or Mareeba for approximately $20, driven out to the communitiesânot necessarily by white people; quite often by Aboriginal peopleâand then sold on-site. They will also sell a cap. You say, `What is a cap?' A cap is the quantity of spirit you can pour into the cap from a bottle of Johnny Walker.</para><para>Senator Bartlett says the people in the community will suffer, that if this payment is taken away from them, it will impact on their economic management. With the greatest of sincerity to Senator Bartlett, I would like him to show me any Aboriginal person in a community who sits down and works out a budget of what they are going to do with their pensions or their pay. In reality, it does not happen. The CDEP was genuinely intended to assist these people. I do not believe it does today. We can, and I believe this chamber should, continue to debate the issues on their merit as they are put forward, but I think we also need to have a practical look at their application.</para><para>Look at Hopevale: there are people in Hopevale who have been paying rent for the last 36 years. They will continue to do that until they dieânever, ever owning those homes. We look at the communities up there and wonder why they do not have any pride in the places they live in.</para><para>I do not believe that it is for us, with the greatest of intent, to provide these people with what we believe is a social answer to their problem. We need to get out there and talk to the people. I spent four days in Pormpuraaw. I have seen the local people picked up, taken down to the local police station, held over 
 night, dried out, given a meal and sent home. That is the reality of what is happening in our communities.</para><para>We need to do two things. First, listen to the people in the communities and find out what they need to do to assist themselves. Second, if they are willing, assist them with some economic formsâin other words, give them the ability to take control of their lives and give them some purpose for living where they live. If, however, they choose to go back to their own traditional way of living, we need to listen to them as well.</para><para>I understand what the opposition is trying to do to preserve these payments to these people. There is resentment within the communities, where some of the communities are seen to be getting two paymentsâand you actually have to be in the community on a payment day to really understand what happens. If the opposition's amendments are successful and that $14 million that is being spoken of is moved into economic development within the communities for the community as a whole, it would bring the communities closer together and actually assist in progressing what we are trying to do.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>8600</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a couple of issues I wish to address. First, on this procedural question: I guess if the Democrats are voting against the amendments, it becomes a largely academic issue. But I would say to the minister that we have tried to cooperate in terms of getting a debate about the principles and not the technicalities. We met with her advisers yesterday and, as I said, we have tried to get the debate back to the question of principles. I was here until 10.30 last night and from 7.30 this morning. If you had a problem and you thought we had an unintended consequence, given that I put on the record three or four times yesterday what our intentions were, I think we would have been better suited trying to sort this out outside of the chamber prior to us coming in.</para></talk.start><para>You always talk to me about the need for prior consultation, good manners, et cetera. I would suggest to you that, if the government thinks there is an unintended consequence of an opposition amendment, you would be 
 better off picking up the phone and talking to me about it. It seems to me that, rather than waste the time of the chamber here as we have again this morning, we could have had that discussion and fixed that.</para><para>I have been very straight about what our intention is. I have said it about eight times in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I accept there may be a problem with an unintended consequence arising from our amendment. I am not sure how many people who actually receive the age pension are working on CDEP, or how many who receive the disability pension are working on CDEP. I suspect the figures are fairly small. In any event, if there is a problem, all I am saying is that we ought to be able to sort that out. Rather than come in and try to score a political point, it seems to me that we would have been better served trying to sort that out.	I want to concentrate on the political issues and the principles.</para><para>Minister, you alleged there was some sort of cheap shot. There is no cheap shot involved. I wanted us to focus though on the impact of this measure. While Senator Harris made some very optimistic and hopeful statements about what could be done with the money instead, the reality I want to focus on is that these amendments deprive Aboriginal single parents of income. We have to focus on that. If the Senate makes that decision, I am prepared to accept that but I want to make sure we focused on that. That is why the opposition opposes this measure; we just cannot see the justification for reducing their benefits.</para><para>I do not want to labour the point. I do not suspect I am going to suddenly come up with a brilliant argument that convinces Senator Bartlett. He has clearly been influenced in recent times to review the Democrats' position and he has come up with a second-best option in terms of the grandfathering clause.</para><para>I do think it would be useful if the Democrats tabled in the Senate the letter to Senator Lees from ATSIC. I have only just been handed a copy of that letter. ATSIC did not choose to write to the opposition. But I noticed that the minister, in quoting, did not quote the whole paragraph from ATSIC; I think it is important that the whole paragraph 
 go on the record so that ATSIC's position is not misunderstood. As I understand it, the letter starts:</para><para>While the board has expressed concern over the potential impact of the new income treatment arrangements for lone parent pensioners on CDEP, the board also acknowledges . . .</para><para>And it goes on. To be fair to ATSIC and Gatjil Djerrkura, the letter ought to be tabled, because it has become part of the debate here today. I do not feel that I should seek to do it; it is not a letter to me. But I think that would be useful.</para><para>I also want to put on the record that the opposition has been approached by a range of CDEP groups who have a different view from ATSIC about the impact of this measure. Of course, that is their right. They have a different perception of the impact. The opposition has been influenced by their views, but also by the discussions we had yesterday with ATSIC in which they briefed the opposition's advisers about their attitude to the bill. What we found particularly telling was that they could not suggest to us that there would be any greater participation in CDEP by sole parents as a result of these measures. That was quite telling in terms of our response: we do not expect that the sorts of things that the minister talks about, such as prevention of women participating in the schemes, will be altered by this. Certainly ATSIC did not put any argument to that effect. I think it important that ATSIC's position go on the record. I would appreciate it if Senator Bartlett would table ATSIC's letter so as to have their position clearly stated, rather than my reading certain bits and the minister reading other bits of their correspondence.</para><para>I put on the record that I am pleased that the minister is starting to listen to ATSIC and the views which they express. I hope this reflects a change of heart by the government more generally in terms of listening to what ATSIC and Aboriginal people have to say. I do take what they say seriously. I did not until recently have a copy of their letter but, as I say, they did not write it to me. In any event, I will not delay the Senate any longer on the basis of the arguments.</para><para>The Labor Party still thinks the government has not made a case for reducing the entitlements of these single parents. They are among the most disadvantaged, and we do not think that the arguments about tensions in the community or levelling the playing field warrant that reduction. That is a judgment people have to make. Given that the Democrats will not be voting for our amendments, I suspect the issue about the unintended consequences falls away, so I do not think we need to worry about resolving that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>8601</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âObviously I do not speak for Senator Bartlett, but I would suggest that there is absolutely no reason for him to need to table the ATSIC letter, as the ATSIC letter was handed to Senator Evans's adviser by my staff two days ago in the Senate.

If the opposition are dealing in, say, taxation law or social security law and think that they can drop pages of amendments on the Senate as the second reading debate is proceeding and expect to get proper scrutiny by people who have got the ability to assess the implications in a very technical system, they are setting themselves up to look foolish in terms of unintended consequences.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything, but if you believe in good govern

Basically the outcome will be that the Senate accepts the rationale of the change that the government is making in relation to the treatment of sole parents' income but protects the income of those that are currently on the CDEP Scheme so that those 4,000 people, as I understand it, will not experience that significant reduction in their income but new participants in the scheme will come on board as part of the new arrangements.</para><para>I will just make a couple of comments. I am quite happy to table the letter from Gatjil Djerrkura. I did not have a copy with me but I will table the copy that Senator Evans has kindly given to me. I had obviously seen a copy of it previously. It was sent to Senator Lees at the end of August and it was passed on to me as the party's social security spokesperson and I responded to that. I am happy to table that letter so that is on the record.</para><para>Senator Evans spoke about being approached by a number of CDEP groups about their concerns which are different to ATSIC. As he 
 said, it is entirely appropriate for different people to have different views. I personally have not and, as far as I am aware, none of the Democrats have been approached by those groups. Without giving advice to ATSIC, if they send letters to the Democrats it would probably be a good idea for them to send them to the opposition as well. Usually when I meet with people about legislation I encourage them to talk to all parties. Much as I like to put the view out there that all wisdom resides with the Democrats, it does not hurt for them to talk to other parties as well. It probably would have been a good idea for ATSIC to send a similar letter to the opposition. But, conversely, I did not receive any representations from people involved in individual CDEP operations putting a contrary view. So I am going on the information and views that were expressed to me.</para><para>There were a couple of comments today about us having wasted time this morning. Whilst a bit of toing-and-froing about unintended consequences and dropping amendments at the last minute may not be that productive, I do think outlining the policy principles in relation to this issue is important and I do not see that as a waste of time. I think it is something worth emphasising.</para><para>I try to take a fairly low key approach, if you like, to social security legislation, as I do with immigration legislationâboth are areas in which public passions can be quite easily inflamed, sometimes in a negative way if one wants to stir things upâand I try to avoid too much fiery rhetoric because I do not think it is constructive in areas such as these. It is nonetheless important to put on the record in a dispassionate way that what we are dealing with, as this amendment is, is indigenous sole parent pensioners and we are trying to ensure that their income is not significantly reduced.</para><para>I take on board Senator Harris's comments before, whatever validity there might be in his comments about how various people budget or do not budget and spend their money. I think moving to significantly reduce the income of people who are already not well off cannot do anything other than have a negative impact on them. While there may be other measures that may mitigate that to some 
 extent, reducing people's income by $40 a week or more when they are not well off to start with should not be dismissed. It is a significant action, and it has an impact on human beingsâhuman beings who are amongst the most disadvantaged. That basic point needs to be made and this Democrat amendment, which hopefully does not have any unintended drafting consequences, moves to protect those people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>âDo you wish to incorporate that letter?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âI have asked to table it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âI believe if you incorporate it, it may be better.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âI am happy to do that.

These issues were identified in both the independent review of the CDEP Scheme (the Spicer Review) and the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.

But, as I indicated on behalf of the opposition earlier, our preferred position obviously was to support our amendments which protected the position of sole parents in terms of the government's intentions in their entirety.</para></talk.start><para>This amendment is an attempt by the Democrats to afford some protection to those currently in receipt of both the parenting payment (single) and CDEP yet obviously does not do anything for the longer term situation of sole parents involved in CDEP. But it does seek to address one of the chief opposition's concerns, which I have stated earlier, which is to try to protect the income level available to these most disadvantaged parents and children. Our approach to this has always been to seek to protect their position and to argue that the arguments for simplicity and level playing fields do not overcome the impact on the individuals affected by this measureâthat is, that they have their income reduced by a significant amount, which then has a detrimental effect on their families.</para><para>The Democrats position, as I understand it, will at least protect those 4,000 or so single parents who are currently involved in CDEP and who receive the parenting payment (single). The opposition intends to support that amendment because it goes some way to achieving the policy outcome that we sought to achieve when we entered this debate and which we think is important. While we would have preferred our amendments being carried, which would have protected the position of all single parents involved in CDEP in future years, this at least has the advantage of ensuring that parents currently in receipt of the parenting payment do not have their income reduced by in the order of $100 per fortnight, which would have an immediate impact on their capacity to care for their children and to support their families. That was at the core of our concern about this measure so, to the extent that the Democrat amendment does that, we support it. It is a second-best option, but it is one that we are prepared to support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>8604</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment. The social policy reform of which this is a part has come through an independent review by Mr Ian Spicer, who recommended that this matter be reformed. On the specific area of people receiving two payments, the proposal has been endorsed by ATSIC, as the letter which has now been incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  demonstrates. In plain equity terms, it is unfair that some people in a community should be treated so very differently from everybody else, none of whom you would say were rich. They are all on the same level of welfare dependency and are all bordering on poverty. The arguments which have just been made are not acceptable.</para></talk.start><para>The effect on women is one that concerns me. Senator Bartlett, of all people, having worked in social security in the past, would well understand how a good social policy is a simpler policyâin terms of administration, the ability of people to access their due entitlements, et ceteraâand that, wherever 
 grandfathering occurs, you get complexities in administration and a less clearly defined system for people to access their entitlements. It is particularly not good social security policy to increase the number of people who are grandfathered for any reason. It is usually done for a political purpose, and that is what is happening in this case. The package has come forward from the government after independent inquiry by Mr Spicer and after endorsement by the elected representatives of the indigenous communities. I would have thought that would weigh heavily on senators' minds. We need to endorse it here, but the government recognises that we will not win this vote.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>8605</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to indicate that I will be opposing the amendment but, in doing that, I would like to clarify the reasons why. It may seem unfair to oppose a motion that intends to assist and protect the people whom you are directing that payment to. The reason I clearly oppose the amendment is that it does not achieve the intended outcome. I tried very briefly before to describe what happens in a community on the day a pension cheque arrives. You really have to be there and experience it to understand what happens. There is resentment within some of the communities. Some of the communities work exceptionally well on the program, but others do not, and in those communities the program has a very adverse effect on the people whom we are intending to help.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Evans's comment about my suggestion of having this amount of money appropriated to schemes that would economically help the communities is an indication either that I am not articulating very well or that he does not agree with the idea of people having dignity. We are putting an amount of money into communities without taking the next step of ensuring that it gets to the women and children whom it is intended to get to. In communities like Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama, it does not have that effect. It goes into the community and is spent in the way that the communities in those areas traditionally spend it. It does not get to help the mothers to go down to the local store to buy provi 
 sions for their childrenâthat is, provided the local community store has the funds to purchase those goods so they can buy them.</para><para>I believe we need to listen to the people in the communities as to how we help them, not impose our ideologies on them. There are ways in which we can help them. We can help them have the integrity of their artwork so that their artwork is not pilfered by people who put it into the tourist shops in Cairns and areas like that with no benefit to the communities from where it has been pilfered.</para><para>These are the areas where we need to assist these people. I believe it would be far more effective to take the amounts of money that we are talking about and turn them around into programs that will actually help all of the communities. We also need to look beyond the communities. A substantial number of Aboriginal people live in the wider community and their needs, in some cases, are as great as, if not greater than, those in the community. Though it may seem a contradiction in terms, my reason for opposing the amendment is that I believe it would be far better to have the equality of the single payment for these people within their communities, to take that additional money and to put it into a process that those communities collectively believe will assist them more.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>8605</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak briefly in response to comments in relation to the amendment. Firstly, I think Senator Harris's comments to a large extent relate more broadly to the CDEP and his views on the operation of that. This issue is obviously a small part of an aspect of the treatment of income relating to the CDEP. I will not necessarily respond to his broader comments about the worth or otherwise of the CDEP as it operates. I have visited a number of indigenous communities myself, both in Queensland and in the Northern Territory. I certainly have some understanding of the situations there, although I would not claim to be an expert by any means.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst I very much endorse the view that just giving people money is not the answer and there are a lot of other issues that need to be incorporated, I am very wary of a view which is taking hold that money is not unim 
 portant. Money does come in reasonably handy. It is not the only thing one needs. Despite some of the romantics out there who think love is all you need, I think money does come in handy occasionally as well. Personal income and basic income support payments are a crucial component of giving people the opportunity to have some control over their lives and some dignity. I certainly do not suggest that it is the only thing, but it is important not to undervalue the basic and crucial aspect of ensuring that people have enough money to live on.</para><para>The Minister for Family and Community Services made some comments about good social policy. I understand what she is saying in relation to that, but I do think it is important to remember that social policy is not just about reviews, academic aspects and coming up with something that makes logical sense but also about the impact on people. I know she is not saying it is not, but I want to keep emphasising that in this type of legislation more than most we are dealing with issues that impact very much on people.</para><para>I acknowledge that grandfather clauses make for administrative messiness, but they also serve more than a political purpose in the narrow sense of the word. I do not think they are totally politically driven a lot of the time. They are a mechanism for smoothing out the negative consequences of change, and that applies in many areas. It is frequently used for that purpose where a change is recognised as being appropriate but a smoothing mechanism is put in place to try to ensure that people are not crunched along the way as the change is made. Whilst it might not be pure social policy, it is still good social policy in the sense that it does prevent negative impacts on individual people.</para><para>Finally, I want to emphasise that the Democrats have not changed our position since Monday as a result of being leaned on by anybody or anything like that. In the comments I have made throughout this debate, I have outlined our concerns about the impact of this measure, but I have certainly not committed us to a particular approach. We have had to balance up the competing claims and the very strong representations from 
 ATSIC wanting the measures to get through. Although it has not been categorically stated, it is clearly an attitude of the government's that we are dealing with a package in the schedule of the bill. There are some very positive measures in it which I know ATSIC and the indigenous communities are very keen to have commence and come into operation. There was very much a real risk here of losing those good measures, and that obviously had an impact on the Democrats' approach on this issue.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Temporary ChairmanâSenator P.H.

The government's legislation seeks to abolish the employment entry payment, which is a non-refundable grant, and replace it with a repayable advance called the new special employment advance, which is in effect a loan. With the current system, the employment entry payment is a non-refundable payment, and the government's proposal is to change that into effectively a loan. The government also seeks to abolish the education entry payment and, to the best of my understanding, not replace that at all for recipients of allowances.</para><para>The opposition are attempting to protect the employment and education entry payments and come some way towards supporting the part of the government's approach that allows a bit more flexibility in what they call the special employment advance. We are seeking to protect the employment entry payment and to provide the option of the advance for those who find it preferable. As I understand it, the government are saying it is preferable that people take an advance if and when they 
 require it and not be entitled to the payment. We say there is some merit in the approach of giving it a bit more flexibility because some people may require the larger amount which is available under the advance. We accept that that may be useful on some occasions.</para><para>But I think there is a fundamental flaw in the sense that it means that people entering employment are entering into further debt at a time when they may well have been unemployed for some time and have acquired a great deal of debt either to institutions or to family and friends. For a lot of people the idea of getting into further debt will not be a terribly attractive one. But, in the sense that the government's approach provides the option for those people, we think that may well be a measure that allows more choice and more flexibility. However, we do not see the argument for the employment entry payment being abolished. We think that there are real costs associated with starting employment and that the payment provides a useful addition to helping people make the transition from unemployment to employment. The payment was introduced in 1991 and has provided some assistance to those people. We do not see the argument for that being removed.</para><para>I admit it is small and I admit that it is not necessarily an incentive for people to take employment but it provides a very tangible assistance for them when taking up work. It provides them with some opportunity to ease that transition into employment and to meet some of the costs associated with starting employment. For that reason, we support the employment entry payment. Our amendment seeks to provide some flexibility. If the government wishes to offer this advance scheme as an addition then we are prepared to support that, but we are not prepared to see the employment entry payment abolished. We think it is a very worthwhile and useful measure that assists people in the transition from unemployment to work. We are a bit perplexed as to why, apart from being a cost cutting measure, the government would seek to remove it.</para><para>In terms of addressing the education entry payment at the same time, I know this is the subject of later amendments but it is a related measure in terms of the debate. We do not understand why the government wants to abolish the education entry payment. We think it provides very useful assistance to people wishing to study.</para><para>I would be interested to hear from the minister what the rationale is for removing that payment, because we think it just removes a key incentive for people to actually seek to further their skills. The payment provides some assistance for people who are enrolling in study. When we are talking about unemployed people, I thought the whole thrust of government policyâand I think this is a bipartisan approachâwas to encourage people to improve their employment skills in order to make themselves more employable and to be able to take on better and more rewarding jobs. We are a bit unclear as to why the government would want to remove that payment which facilitates that movement from unemployment to study, allowing people to better themselves. We will be opposing that measure.</para><para>As I say, while we seek to come some way towards the government's approach in terms of employment entry payments, we seek to maintain the current entry payment for those who wish to access it. Apart from being a savings measure, I do not understand the reason for removing that entitlement.

Applicants for the SEA will need to demonstrate that either they have earned income from casual work but have not yet received that income, or they 
 have received a definite offer of employment of at least six weeks duration but do not have sufficient financial resources to take up that employment.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Evans just now was asking for the rationale behind the introduction of this measure. I say to him that the Working Nation departmental evaluation of the employment entry payment scheme, which was initially introduced as an incentive provision, has indicated that it does not appear to be a major force in influencing customers' decisions to take up work. In addition, the scheme is complex. There are differences in the rates and the conditions attaching to the scheme that depend on the customers' payment types.</para><para>For example, you do not get an employment entry payment if you are going into part-time work, because usually if you are going into part-time work you are still on part Newstart allowance and you cannot therefore get an employment entry payment. You can get an employment entry payment only once in 12 months, and for people who are struggling to get back into the work force the ability to take up a succession of part-time jobs throughout the course of a year is very important. So, having had your employment entry payment once, you are then precluded from getting it again during the course of that year.</para><para>Now, with the special employment advance, you can get it any time you need it. It is very much more flexible, it is a bigger sum of money and it is available for that transitional phase from perhaps being long-term unemployed, or certainly unemployed, into more sustainable long-term employment. I think those are very good reasons for saying the special employment advance is the right way to go. It builds on the purpose behind the employment entry payment, but it is a much better arrangement. There is also a separate group of people who have been in casual work and who have not yet been able to receive that income. Teachers are a classic example of this. There has, I think, been a lot of lobbying of successive governments over a number of years to try to fix that because they are deemed to have received income that they have not in fact received. So the special 
 employment advance is useful for that group of people as well.</para><para>I do not think that there is any virtue in retaining the employment entry payment when you have got a larger payment that is available any time you need it, compared with the employment entry payment which is available only once in a year. For the employment entry payment to not be available for people who take up part-time work and are still on part Newstart allowance seems to me to be a pretty deficient kind of employment entry payment because it is a much more likely way that a lot of people will get back into the work force. They will not easily go straight from unemployment, especially if it is long-term unemployment, into a full-time job. They are much more likely to put their foot on the escalator again through the means of part-time work. To do that and not be eligible for the employment entry payment seems a bit of a nonsense to me. I think this is an important reform. You do not need to retain the employment entry payment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>8609</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking to the opposition amendment I will also speak to the foreshadowed ones that are coming up next and which relate to the same issue, just to get my comments out of the way all at once. Initially, in response to the minister's comments about the review and the current operation of the employment entry payment, if there are problems or deficiencies in the way the payment currently operates I would have thought the better way to go would be to address those deficiencies rather than scrap it altogether.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the special employment advance that is being proposed, I have great reservations about that. The opposition's amendment does not knock that out so that is not an issue to explore further, but it is very different from the employment entry payment. The opposition's amendment will, as I understand it, enable that advance to operate whilst retaining the employment entry payment, thus giving people the option. Down the track, if the advance operates as well as the government seems to think it will, it may be justifiable to revisit the issue of the employment 
 entry payment if the employment advance operates in a more effective way.</para><para>But there are a couple of big differences about the advance as opposed to the employment entry payment as it currently exists. Firstly, it is an advance. It is not a payment; it is a loan which needs to be repaid. As I said in my contribution at the second reading stage, I have great reservations about the introduction of the principle of social security payments being put forward as advances or loans rather than as entitlements. This is only a very small measure in the grand scheme of the operation of the Social Security Act. But, as I said at the time, there is such a thing as the thin end of the wedge, and I have concerns that this may be one of those circumstances where, once this principle is established in the act, it will be extended to a wide range of other payments over time, and the concept which has actually been floated by some commentators in recent times that social security payments should follow the way of HECS fees and be a debt or a loan that is recoverable rather than a payment that is paid through entitlement is the sort of approach I would have great reservations about.</para><para>Having said that, the operation as detailed here in the explanatory memorandum shows the difference. The concerns or the problems that the minister outlined about people taking up part-time work may well be genuineâI am sure they are genuineâbut that is not the whole story in relation to the employment entry payment. I think if you look at the explanatory memorandum and how it will operate you will get a clearer idea of the main motivation hereâthat is, that the outlays from the special employment advance would, in a few years time, be less than $1 million a year, yet the savings from the employment entry payment being abolished are $18 million.</para><para>The memorandum does not mention the modifications to the education entry payment which I understand is being done as well. I would have thought there were some cost or savings implications there. I do not know if they are folded into the total of the employment entry payments as outlined in the explanatory memorandum, but I assume they are also being claimed as a savings measure. For 
 those reasons that I have outlined, the Democrats support the aim of the opposition in this amendment and the next couple of amendments.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>8610</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move opposition amendment No. 34 on sheet 1391:</para></talk.start><para>(34)	 Schedule 3, item 43, page 49 (after line 32), before paragraph 1061EO(1)(a), insert:</para><para>		 (aa)	 the person is qualified for an employment entry payment under Part 2.13 and has made a claim under section 665 in respect of the offered employment; or</para><para>I think we have had the debate on this amendment.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>âWe now move to opposition amendment No. 35 on sheet 1391.

But, as I say, I am not clear on exactly how much the government intends saving if that is carried.

We need to look at the history of that process. In some cases, but not all, people have been paid their entry payment, gone out and purchased shoes or uniforms to participate in employment and then a week or two weeks later walked away from that employment. I am not saying that they are doing that solely to get the entry payment; I am highlighting one of the outcomes of that process.</para></talk.start><para>I believeâand maybe the minister can assist me hereâthe intention of replacing that with a special employment advance is that the person, once in the work force, is then required to pay that advance back. Of the two systems, I believe that the government's position in reducing the availability of the entry paymentâwhich the person can take with no obligation whatsoever to pay it back and no obligation to continue in the employment which that entry payment assisted them 
 to getâand replacing it with an advance to the tune of $500, which they are required to repay, is a healthy situation on two counts. Firstly, it will give that person far more support to continue in their employment. Secondly, it requires that person to have the personal discipline to budget to pay that back. In relation to society that is a far better process to be following.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>8611</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn answer to Senator Harris, it is not unusual where people do get advances currently in social security that, depending on their personal circumstances, the rate of payment of an advance can be negotiated, and it is constantly. If somebody were to take the full $500 of their special advanceâand they do not have to take the full amountâit would usually be repaid at the rate of 14 per cent of their payment. Therefore, it would take about six months. I do not think that is unfair, when it is the taxpayer helping them to get back into the work force. It is more generous, as I said earlier, than the employment entry payment.</para></talk.start><para>What I particularly like about it is that it is available to a number of people who currently cannot get the employment entry payment because they are still on a part Newstart allowance and are taking up part-time work. If that job does not pan outâwhich sometimes does happen, for a variety of reasonsâthen they can come back again and get another advance. They are not restricted to one a year if they are going into that stage in their lives when they are trying valiantly to take a succession of part-time jobs to get back into the work force properly again. I think it is a pretty fair kind of thingâfair to the taxpayer and fairer to the person than what is currently provided with the employment payment which we are proposing now to abolish with the introduction of this measure.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that schedule 3, part 2 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>8611</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>(13)	 Schedule 4, item 13, page 72 (line 10), after "payment", insert "either while the person was in gaol or psychiatric confinement, or".</para><para>The crisis payment is a very important initiative.

It is expensive and counterproductive to jail these offenders. In the light of that in Queensland, the National-Liberal coalition has introduced a private member's bill that reflects one of One Nation's policies, that fine defaulters should be kept out of jail. Further, they should have their income or social security garnisheed at its source, to ensure the fine payment. In case of extreme hardship, they should be sentenced to community service.</para><para>By not jailing fine defaulters except as a last resort, it is anticipated that in Queensland there would be a saving of approximately $12.6 million from the Corrective Services budget. It costs the state taxpayers in Queensland approximately $45,000 per annum to incarcerate a prisoner. In Queensland, Pauline Hanson's One Nation state parliamentarian 
 teams have been influencing the government's simplistic policies to bring them up to date with the expression of the will of the people. It comes as no surprise that we have to implement simplistic policies in this chamber that are obviously driven by economic expediency and not by the needs of a particular disadvantaged group within our community.</para><para>This government is proposing to halve the allowance currently provided for newly released prisoners. This crisis payment was introduced to provide some assistance to persons who had a very high level of need. This help was in the form of a current special benefit prison release payment, which twice provided a one-week payment. This payment was designed to assist newly released prisoners to obtain accommodation and transport facilities and to meet living expenses while integrating into the community. The proposed one-off crisis payment, being a one-week payment, provides less financial assistance.</para><para>A research program was conducted recently in Queensland by the Prisoners Legal Service Inc., and I congratulate them on their work and their findings. The Prison and Debt project was designed to inquire into the effects of imprisonment on the debt levels of prisoners and to ascertain the nature and extent of any flow-on social or criminological effects of indebtedness in the prison population to families and prisoners in the wider community. The project's desired outcome was to identify and remedy the detrimental effects of imprisonment on prisoners' debt levels. The project identified that debt levels for prisoners increase while they are in jail and that their debts frequently rise to such levels that they cannot repay them or effectively manage them upon release. A key finding of the report was that 49 per cent of those interviewed admitted to committing further crimes upon release, in order to repay burgeoning debt.</para><para>The report identified that most prison sentences served in Australia are short. The Prisoners Legal Service identified that over 21 per cent of people serve less than three months. Sentences this short can, however, have serious ramifications, including the loss of job, home, car or all personal possessions 
 with the growth of debt. Debts of imprisonment are often additional to debts that prisoners are already experiencing difficulties with or cannot repay. It is worth reminding the Senate that 25 per cent of prisoners are fine defaulters. It is reasonable that a proportion would have paid their fines, if finances had been available. So we have a cat chasing its tail.</para><para>The community suffers by the release of significant numbers of prisoners with an unpaid level of debt, a debt they cannot repay. The effect is in terms not only of a possible increase in the crime rate but of an increase in the number of despairing citizens who may not commit a crime but are forced to live on the edge of society. These are the people who prick our conscience when we leave our restaurants or shows and see them cold, lonely and hungry, wandering the streets.</para><para>Many of the simplest of remedies, if implemented, will contribute to ensuring that the families of prisoners are enabled to maintain a stable family unit. A newly released prisoner deserves to be given an opportunity to return to society with the means to regain their dignity. They deserve to be given a chance to overcome their punishment and to reunite with their family's lives.</para><para>A case study by the Prisoners Legal Service in Queensland demonstrates why One Nation has a policy committed to keeping fine defaulters out of jail. I wish to relate this case study. A single parent with a two-year-old child was left struggling to pay three loans, for a car, furniture and a housing loan bond. She obtained part-time work but did not declare it on her benefit form and kept drawing her full benefit. When Centrelink became aware, she began to pay back the money, selling her TV and stereo and falling behind in other bills. She was charged with fraud and, by the time she fronted the court, she had paid all the money back to the government. She received a three-month sentence and was taken immediately to the watchhouse. Her mother cared for her son, but relations between mum and the daughter were strained. </para><para>Prisoners are not allowed to phone government departments from jail. She incorrectly received two further payments from Centrelink but was unable to call them from jail to cancel the payments. Her flat was broken into when she was in jail. Intruders lived in the flat for about three weeks, gaining access to her bankcard signature and thereby withdrawing her Centrelink overpayments. They trashed the flat and left a large phone bill. On release from jail, this lady had a debt to Centrelink and a debt to the Department of Housing and owed money for gas, electricity and telephone. The chances of being reunited with her son were minimal, as she could not obtain a private flat to rent.</para><para>Do not think that One Nation is going soft on crime. We are not. We firmly believe that perpetrators of heinous crimes deserve to have the law book thrown at them. The rights of the victims and their families must be taken into account during sentencing. We firmly believe that prisoners should face punishment, restitution and rehabilitation in that order. However, state governments continue to jail fine defaulters. We are only exacerbating an already untenable position. These sentences create disastrous changes in many people's lives, including the loss of jobs, homes and personal possessions. Increasing debt levels make the punishment out of all proportion to the debt. Then the federal government withdraws the little support it was offering.</para><para>The Catholic Prison Ministry states that they believe that people will usually make the choice to live a lawful lifestyle when they are supported in an environment affirming their self-worth and providing for their basic needs. The crisis payment at its current level goes some way towards assisting newly released prisoners, who have paid their debt through their time in jail, to be given some opportunity to successfully move back into society.</para><para>The government's approach always seems to be based on how they can save moneyâwhich group is the least vocal and least respected in the community; where is the little Aussie who can be squeezed a little more tightly? The upper crust hardly have to worry about the potential of re-offending as they live in blue ribbon seats and are insulated 
 from this problem. The average Aussie, however, must take it on the chin, grin and bear it and then grizzle as insurance companies refuse to re-insure their properties. I would invite senators to stay in homes in Goodna and Darra where insurance companies have refused to insure vehicles, homes and contents. We have a government whose only intervention is to decrease the level of support available to a newly released prisoner so that they can integrate back into the community.</para><para>Let Pauline Hanson's One Nation point out some costs. We need effective strategies that could lessen the distress caused by those who are incarcerated. This government seems to only know how to slash and burn and allocate funds to those most disadvantaged. On introduction into jail it would make sense for Centrelink to provide all prisoners with a form to be filled out by those receiving benefits thus advising of their sentence. Thereby, Centrelink would avoid paying funds incorrectly and would avoid incurring the cost of reclaiming those payments. Centrelink would allow three months breathing space for prisoners after release before commencing to deduct payments from them in order to facilitate a smooth transition into mainstream life. The Child Support Agency could provide prisoners with a form to be filled out by those with a debt to CSA advising of the sentence, thereby saving the tax department unnecessary costs in catching the defaulters.</para><para>These recommendations are just some commonsense approaches provided in the excellent report of the Prisoners Legal Service in Queensland. We cannot and will not support any cutback in crisis payments to newly released prisoners. Unlike some in the government, we continually care for those in need. We want to see them given a chance to retain their self-esteem and self-worth. We do not want to see more displaced, homeless Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>8615</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can see that Senator Harris has his heart in the right place for prisoners. Unfortunately, a lot of his speech and certainly his allegations were ill 
 founded. There are no savings at all in this proposal. We are not halving the allowance, as he said. In fact, the amount of money going to the prisoners remains the same. We are bringing it forward so that they have it when they come out of jail. It is a benefit to prisoners. It is helping them.</para></talk.start><para>They get three weeks pay as they did before, but before they got it after they got out of jail. Now they will get one week as they go out of jail and two weeks as soon as they have signed on the dotted line. If they are in real hardship they can get an advanced payment. I am sorry, Senator, but I am afraid some of the things you said were based on a misunderstanding.</para><para>If you doubled the rate of the crisis payment for all people, it would cost nearly $2.4 million a year. If you simply did it for prisoners you would be up around $500,000 on top of what is paid now. There is no way that we are trying to cut money to the prisoners. We believe that the society is not served by having prisoners leave prison with no money to buy food or get shelter. That is why we are introducing the measure. We are bringing the payment up front so that they get it earlier.</para><para>I am distressed that you would think that that is what we are doing. It is a beneficial measure. It is a beneficial measure for, say, people whose homes have been caught in a bushfire and who suddenly need an immediate payment. It is a beneficial measure for people who are escaping domestic violence. I would have thought you would have endorsed it wholeheartedly. It is a new measure, but it is not cutting any money from the prisoners. It is bringing their payment forward so that they do not leave jail without anything in their pocket to buy a bus fare.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>8615</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats agree with a lot of what Senator Harris said and the intent of his amendment. The government should be congratulated for introducing a crisis payment. It is extending much needed assistance to a fairly small group of people, but, nonetheless, a group of people who will very much benefit from the measure. Sometimes we deal with measures that only deal with a small group of people and may seem fairly insignificant in 
 the scheme of things, but for that small group of people and those individuals it can make an enormous amount of difference. The fact that the numbers are not huge should not detract from that.</para></talk.start><para>I would like a bit more clarification from the minister in relation to the way things operate currently for released prisoners, as opposed to how things will operate under this new crisis payment. I have received representations from the Welfare Rights Network about the impact of this measure on prisoners. I am not criticising the positive aspects of the measure in relation to other people, but certainly they had concerns that it would lead to a disadvantage for some newly released prisoners compared to their current situation.</para><para>The excellent report Senator Harris quoted extensively from is one that bears close study. It is an important area. I am not sure I would agree with the full thrust of all of Senator Harris's rhetoric about prisoners and our jail system, but his concerns and the concerns put forward by the Queensland Prisoners Legal Service are very important. Regardless of your views about crime and punishment and law and order, I think everyone in the community would recognise, even from a self-interest point of view, that it is totally counterproductive to release people back into the community in a situation where they are in extreme hardship or very pressing debt. A very small amount of extra assistance at that time when they re-enter the community can save an enormous amount of money down the track by making it less likely that they will re-offend and more likely that they will have an opportunity to re-establish themselves in the community. Obviously, that is not only in their interests but in the interests of the entire community.</para><para>So the principle that Senator Harris outlined is one that I wholeheartedly agree with. Personally, I think where necessary, extra assistance should be provided to released prisoners over and above others for the reason I just outlinedâthat it is in the community's interest to ensure people are able to get back on their feet as effectively as possible. It is in no-one's interests to have people re-offend or go into a situation of poverty. Indeed, it is 
 never in the community's interests to have anyone in ongoing and entrenched poverty.</para><para>Just returning to the issue of how the system works now: my understandingâwhich the minister can correct and I am sure will correct if it is incorrectâis that currently people can receive the special benefit prison release payment, which is designed to provide immediate cash assistance. That recognises that newly released prisoners can incur delays in obtaining employment or social security payment, and it provides up to one week of payment of special benefit at twice the normal rate. That is my understanding of how things are able to operate now, whereas the proposed one-off crisis payment contained in this schedule will provide only one week's payment at the normal rate. That is where Senator Harris was coming from in suggesting that they will get half of what they currently get now.</para><para>That is my understanding from what I have been advised. If that is the case, then certainly I would be supportive of Senator Harris's amendmentâfor the reason of restoring the situation as well as for the broader reason that it is in the community's interest to provide extra assistance for released prisoners to some extent over and above the detail that I have asked about now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>8616</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI just double-checked in case I had in any way misunderstood or misled anybody. The fact is, as I told Senator Harris, the level of assistance available to released prisoners claiming a social security allowance will not change under the new arrangementâthe level of assistance is three weeks pay for three weeks. The difference is when they get it. Released prisoners will get the equivalent of three weeks payment in the first fortnight after release, as they do currently. They will get the crisis payment plus one week's pension or benefit when they are released, with the remaining week's pension or benefit at the end of the first fortnight. Pensioners who are released from prison will receive the same level of assistance as allowees.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harris, you may be interested to know why this was necessary. With the New South Wales truth in sentencing legislation, prisoners can now be released at midnight, and this will prevent the hardship that is occasioned by people being put outside the jail door with no money at all. You made the suggestion in your speech about filling in a Centrelink form, et cetera. When we were in opposition, we found that the previous government did not know people were in jail and were continuing to pay themâsometimes for years. That obviously was not a system that could continue and, as part of our major effort against fraud and ensuring compliance in the social security system, we introduced data links and exchange of information with the corrective services around Australia so we could prevent that happening. Prior to that, the Commonwealth did not know when people were in jail. Now we have the ability to get this money to people earlier than previously. We are not changing the level of money that they are entitled to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>8617</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you, Minister, for conveying that the government's intention was to move towards ensuring that these payments did not continue while prisoners were in jail. As I explained earlier, unfortunately it is still happening. So if there is a form that is supplied by Centrelink, we need to go back and look at that process. In this lady's case, her predicament was that not only was she paid those two payments while she was in jail but somebody accessed her flat, accessed her cards and actually withdrew that amount. So the reality is that the problem still exists at this time and that definitely needs addressing.</para></talk.start><para>To come back to the reason for the amendment that we have moved, it has been clearly indicated to us, not only by the Catholic Prison Ministry but also by other people that we have spoken to, that on their reading of the bill the prisoners will be disadvantaged.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âThey will not be disadvantaged.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name></talker><para>âI appreciate the minister saying that they will get one of the payments earlier, and I commend the government for that.

It relates to the newly arrived residents waiting period, which is a topic that I have spoken on a number of times in this chamber over the last couple of years. I will not go into a fully-fledged storm of outrage. As I said earlier on, I try to approach social security issues and immigration issuesâthis one combines the twoâin a non-inflammatory way, although I must say that this particular aspect of the two-year waiting period is one that I do have a bit of trouble retaining a dispassionate approach to, because I find it one of the more distasteful aspects of social security policy over recent years. The measure itself is only a small aspect of that, and there is an argument of consistency in relation to the measure which the government has put forward to promote consistency in the application of the waiting period. It relates to applying the newly arrived residents waiting period to aspects of the Health Insurance Act and health care cards.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst it might not sound like a particularly significant thing, it is a measure that will, according to the explanatory memorandum, in a couple of years time save around $13Â½ million. As I repeatedly point out, saving taxpayers' money is a good thing. But taking assistance away from people in need is not a good thing. In many aspects, this whole issue of the two-year waiting period is a false economy. Not providing assistance to people when they are first settling in the country can make it a lot more difficult for them to establish themselves and can often lead to greater cost, not just to the public purse but to the social fabric down the track.</para><para>The two-year waiting period is a measure that the Democrats have consistently opposed, and we continue to oppose it. I know that the ALP initially opposed the measure, and it came into being through the support of Senator Harradine. At one stage an attempt of mine to repeal it was unsuccessful because of the vote of Senator Harradine. We had a brief Senate committee inquiry into it, by which 
 time we came back here and I had another attempt at repealing it; Senator Harradine had been convinced but unfortunately the ALP had ceased to be convinced. So once again the measure remained in place. That was a source of some disappointment to me, I must say, but obviously I did not argue quite as expertly as I thought I had. Perhaps I had assumed, given Labor's previous support for the position of removing the two-year waiting period for special benefits, that that position would be retained.</para><para>In the Senate committee inquiry, the ALP produced a suggestion, which I think was repeated here in this chamber, that there would be a need to review the two-year waiting period and its impacts after a couple of years. That couple of years has now passed and we certainly think that it would be a good idea to assess more broadly the impact that the two-year waiting period is having across the board.</para><para>Certainly a lot of information has been provided to me from people who are working out in the community with migrants that it is having a significant negative impactâit is generating hardship for a number of people, for a number of families. Again, that number may not be huge but, for those who are suffering hardship as a result of this measure, telling them that they are only a small number does not really help them very much. It is still a measure that is causing very significant suffering, and I think it sends out some very unhelpful messages more broadly about some of the stereotypes about migrants coming here to go on social security and bludge off the Australian community and things like thatâsome of those more distasteful suggestions that are voiced on this issue from time to time. I think this measure gives implicit support to some of those comments from other people.</para><para>The Democrats continue to be very concerned about the impact of the two-year waiting period. This schedule has only a small impact on that in terms of its extension to health related issues. I will refrain from moving another amendment to try to change the two-year waiting period to enable access to special benefit because I can reasonably 
 assume what the outcome would be in the chamber. Nonetheless, I indicate that the Democrats' concerns are still as strong as ever.</para><para>I urge all other parties to reconsider this issue in terms of the actual impact it is having on people in this community. As I say, with this schedule in particularâthe specific measure we are opposingâit is another $13Â½ million of assistance in health issues which can be amongst the most important areas of need for people in the community. Oftentimes they can find a way of getting by in terms of income but those extra health costs, particularly if they have children, can really make the difference. I am assuming that the Democrats will be unsuccessful in getting this schedule deleted from the legislation, but I urge all parties to keep considering this issue and the real impact that it is having on families out in the community at the moment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>8619</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âVery briefly, I will respond to Senator Bartlett. Most of his contribution was directed to the wider issue of the two-year waiting period generally. The schedule that we have before us now relates purely to New Zealanders. If the Democrats were to be successful in their opposition to this schedule, it would mean that, despite an agreement between the governments of New Zealand and Australia, Australians would have to serve a two-year waiting period in New Zealand for benefits in New Zealand but New Zealanders coming here would be able to access benefits straightaway.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think that is something the Australian community would think was fair. We see it as fair that all migrants or anybody coming to live in our country should be treated the same unless they are refugees or humanitarian migrants.

This is the changes the government proposes to the liquid assets test. Schedule 9 tightens the rules under which people can be precluded from receiving social security benefits for up to 13 weeks on the basis of their liquid assets. The schedule provides that a person who is engaged in full-time study cannot be regarded as unemployed for the purpose of the liquid assets test waiting period. The changes will have the effect of making an individual wait up to an additional 13 weeks for unemployment benefits if they elect to study before seeking employment. If someone makes the decision to study, they may face a maximum waiting period of up to 26 weeks rather than just 13 weeks if they decide to go straight on to unemployment benefits. We see this as a disincentive to study and acquire new skills and we have much the same concerns as we did about the education entry payment.</para></talk.start><para>I understand what the government's rationale is but, as we understand it, the provision will deny 2,500 Newstart recipients access to the allowance and about 60 sickness allowance recipients access in a year. These are people who might otherwise be caught by the government's proposal and be denied access to the allowances. It seems to us that there is no question of double dipping here. It is a question of whether you provide encouragement for people to study and not put potential barriers in the way of people moving from study to employment or to seeking employment.</para><para>We think that the impact of this measure is to actually make it less attractive for people to seek to study and puts another barrier or consideration in their way in terms of them seeking to study and then seeking to join the work force. We do not think that disincentive is a good thing. We think the current provision is a better way of treating students moving between study and the work force. We do not think the government's proposition is good policy, and we will be opposing it. We would be better off leaving the current situation as it is and allowing students to move from study to employment without this further barrier.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>8620</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSince the liquid assets test was previously before the parliament, we have found that the way the legislation has been interpreted by the tribunals means that it is not being applied consistently. As a result of that, schedule 9 is to provide consistency across payment types, which seems a pretty fair way of approaching something. We in this chamber do not generally endorse payments or add-ons to payments being treated in different ways or special conditions for payments being very different across payment types. This measure simply ensures consistency in the application of the liquid assets waiting period. In addition, a person transferring from Austudy payment to a Newstart allowance would not normally have to serve a liquid assets test waiting period, because they would be considered to have been in receipt of an income support payment for a continuous period. The government therefore do not intend to support the opposition's proposal to oppose schedule 9.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>8620</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats are also concerned with the impact of schedule 9. It is, again, small in the scheme of thingsâ$1.5 million in a couple of years timeâbut it will have an impact on some individual people. It often seems to be the case when we are rationalising inconsistencies and providing for uniform treatment that it ends up being a savings measure rather than a cost, and this is another example of that. More broadly, the Democrats' view is that this provision will act as a disincentive to study by increasing the amount of time that people who undertake study will have to wait to access income support. As is frequently said by people from all parties in this chamber, providing incentives for people to undertake education is a very important aim. This measure will act in the opposite direction and, for that reason, the Democrats will not support it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>8620</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI recognise 
 that I am not going to win this vote, and it is a pity. In our view, a loophole has now been opened by virtue of a decision. It will be used by more people now that it is available. This schedule was an attempt to close that loophole. I point out that an AAT decision recently held that a person could be unemployed while undertaking a full course of study. The effect of that decision for Newstart claimants is that education leavers with liquid assets in excess of the established limits can avoid the application of the liquid assets test waiting period despite having significant liquid assets. To me, that is a nonsense, and I would have thought most Australians would have thought it was a nonsense too. I am disappointed that the parties in this chamber are prepared to see a loophole open that will only be pushed wider as it becomes known.

It has been identified that 97 per cent of the greatest losers will be sole parents. The remaining losers will be carer payment recipients. The government always commends itself on caring for carers but then, in the next breath, it removes a small benefit from a group of people who are prepared to stay home to look after their loved ones. I cannot support a motion that primarily removes from support for sole parents an opportunity to improve their mental or physical wellbeing and, in doing so, prepare for their future and for the future of their children.</para></talk.start><para>It would appear the Liberal Party's economic rationalists are at it again in what will be a short-term gain for the government's coffersâapproximately $6.5 million in 2001-02âand long-term pain for the people who will eventually be required to move back into the work force. Those people will find their skill levels seriously depleted in an environ 
 ment that all sides of politics agree is changing rapidly, particularly with our new technology. The irony is that, in the long term, governments will pay more, as they will have to offer training and educational opportunities for those who will now be both long-term unemployed and unskilled.</para><para>The government is saying that, if you study only 25 per cent to 50 per cent of a full-time course, your costs are automatically halved. Depending on the course, you may well find that you still have to travel as many days as you did previously. Your books can vary significantly in cost from subject to subject, but you will still need to the same amount of books and, as of 1 July, you will also have to manage a goods and services tax. The funds are not designed to provide a pat on the back for using your initiative and pursuing further education whilst forced to stay at home. They were to assistâand I stress the word `assist'âin keeping your skills, knowledge and abilities to a level that works towards keeping you work ready.</para><para>The skills obtained from further educational opportunities also provide social and emotional benefits. Single parents and carers in particular often become isolated from mainstream society. Educational opportunities provide these community members with an ability to mix with others both older and younger than themselves. It is not unusual to find that students find new support networks that can assist them in developing new parenting, caring and recreational outlets that assist in maintaining a healthy mind and body.</para><para>The reduction of payments to part-time students who study between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the full-time course demonstrates a lack of commitment by the government to provide worthwhile educational opportunities to all members of the community. It demonstrates simplicity in the way this determination has been made in that part-time study does not necessarily equate to a lesser amount of outlay for the student. It impacts on those people whom this government has indicated it particularly cares aboutâthat is, the carers. It does nothing to support sole parents who have a genuine desire to either keep their skills up to date or improve their 
 skills in many areas, including work, parenting and social skills. For this reason, I will not support the schedule.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>8622</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe pensioner education supplement measure will amend the rate of payment to better reflect the study load being undertaken by a pensioner. It is not a question of economic rationalism; it is just straight commonsense. If you are doing a half load, you do not get a full-time supplement. If you are doing a full-time load, you get a full-time supplement. Pensioners on a study load of 50 per cent or greater will continue to get the full rate of PES, which is $60 a fortnight, while pensioners undertaking a study load of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent will get the half rate of PES, which is $30 a fortnight.</para></talk.start><para>The pensioner education supplement for disability support pensioners and veterans affairs pensioners will remain unchanged. In passing, I suggest that people who are getting income support as a parenting payment (single) or carers who are getting a carers payment would, one would presume, find it pretty difficult to take on a full-time study load and still maintain their caring role. I think the reality is that a large proportion of people would in fact be taking a half load or maybe even less because the role of carer is very demanding. It is unrealistic to think that you can take on a full study load and be a full-time carer at the same time.</para><para>The government are very supportive of carers, as Senator Harris has acknowledged. In each budget since we came into government, we have done things that needed to be done to help carers. We continue to have a very keen concern for them. Carers and people on parenting payment (single) can also get access to the JET schemeâthe Jobs, Education and Training schemeâwhich helps people get the skills to get into the work force, to get off welfare dependency, to be self-sufficient and to have the dignity of being self-reliant. The government are totally committed to the concept of people being able to improve their state, educational ability and 
 skills. We just think it is pretty rationalâif that is what economic rationalism isâfor people to be paid for the amount of study that they are doing. That is what this reflects. It reflects the amount of study against the amount of supplement. At the same time, people are still getting their full pension payment in social security. There is no effect on that. I think it is a very reasonable thing to do. I think the taxpayer would, too.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>8622</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis section deals with the pensioner education supplement, which is a non-taxable supplementary payment of $60 per fortnight for pensioners who qualify as either full-time students or concessional study load students. It is designed, as I understand it, to assist pensioners towards financial independence through participation in education courses. It is another incentive towards education. The government is proposing to cut that payment to $30 for those who have only a part-time study load. Whilst it may seem logical on the surface that you get half the payment if you are doing half the study, I do not see this payment as operating in that way. I see it as a basic incentive payment for pensioners, regardless of their study load, to undertake education.</para></talk.start><para>If you are going to apply a pure logic principle, I cannot see the purely rational reason why the government is exempting disability support pensioners from this measure. It has said that it is in recognition that people have less capacity to increase their study loads in response to this change. That may be the case. For the reasons the minister just outlined, I am sure many carers would also have difficulty in increasing their study loads in response to this change. I cannot see any simple logical reason why disability pensioners should retain the full payment despite studying part time while other pensioners now have their payment cut in half. My understanding is that this will impact on nearly 8,000 recipients of the pensioner education supplement. I cannot see a reason why that payment should be reduced. It would clearly provide less assistance in the purpose that the payment was designed for, which is to assist pensioners to undertake education.</para><para>It seems to me to be basically a cost cutting measure that will hit the pensions of sole parent pensioners and carers. The Democrats believe that we need to be doing all we can to assist people in undertaking education. This will reduce the income of a significant number of people by $30 a fortnight for a reason that seems fairly flimsy to me. The Democrats will be joining Senator Harris of One Nation in opposing this schedule.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>8623</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must say that I am a bit torn on this proposal. I think it is fair to say that the Labor Party accept that there is a sound basis for the sort of approach the government has adopted. If you look at the Austudy pensioner education supplement that the payment is being based on in terms of the study load, it has a basic logic to itâthat the commitment given to study will be dependent, and the costs associated with it will be dependent, in part on the amount of study undertaken. So we have an inclination to say that there is some sense to that. We obviously have had a great deal of criticism of the government's approach in terms of support for sole parents and the cuts to JET and what we see as the government's under-utilisation of work in that regard.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âThere has been an expansion of JETâit has been expanded.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âYou made early budget cuts to JET, Minister. As I understand it, Centrelink is not meeting its targets for the number of participants in the scheme, after the government's cutbacks. So we do think the government needs to do better in support for sole parents who are making the transition from welfare to work. The Labor Party is concerned to have a much better strategy for that transition, particularly for sole parents, so I have some sympathies with the concerns raised about this being a measure that seems to be cost cutting rather than achieving any great benefit for those seeking to undertake study.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On balance, the Labor Party has agreed to support the government's position because of the rationale of having the allowance based on a connection with the amount of study undertakenâthat is, a payment that is made 
 in recognition of the costs associated with that study. I think Senator Bartlett raised a question which I was going to raise that I would appreciate the minister answering, and that is the question about the disability support pension and why that is treated differently. I would like to understand the government's rationale for that. It is clear in the explanatory memorandum that that is exempted and I am not quite sure that I understand why. The minister adds that there is also a second exemption for veterans. I think it would be useful, both for me and for the record, for the government to explain the rationale for that.

From memoryâI could not vouch for this for certain because it is a while since I looked at the detail of thisâa fairly small proportion of people who had disabilities were taking a full-time load, and this was coupled with the fact that they usually have greater costs in accessing a service like education.

First of all, in reality, it is going to become a disincentive to people who have this heavy workload of caring for their children or a close relative to embark on these educational 
 programs. As a result of that, in the long term the costs will be greater to the government. If they had provided this extra assistance to these people and helped them to be able to further their education while they were carers or while they were single parents, these people would be in a far better position to enter the work force at the end of that period. I believe that, while the government may be making some short-term gain in implementing this reduction, in actuality they are creating a higher cost in the long term.</para></talk.start><para>It is therefore very difficult to understand the rationale and the compassion of the government in reducing this payment to these people. They obviously need all the incentives that we can give to assist them to keep up with the changes in technology. These changes are immense now and I believe they will continue to have a more substantial impact on a person's ability to become re-employed. Therefore, I believe the government is, in actuality, being short-sighted in moving this reduction in assistance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that schedule 10 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âWe now move to government amendment No. 17 on sheet FC206 revised.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>(17)	 Page 107 (after line 6), at the end of the bill, add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Schedule 12âAdministrative provisions</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Social Security Act 1991</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1  At the end of Chapter 2</inline></para><para>	 Add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Part 2.27âEarly payment of first instalment of social security benefit</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1061ZAAR  Early payment of first instalment of social security benefit</inline></para><para>	 (1)	 If, after the commencement of this section:</para><para>		 (a)	 the Secretary determines:</para><para>			 (i)	 that a claim by a person for a social security benefit is to be granted; or

When I last spoke on this area, I was speaking about the need for us to move to a system in this country where regions are given assistance to lift themselves up by their bootstraps. The research shows that, rather than top-down assistance on a massive scale as we saw under the Whitlam government with the creation of the failed growth centres concept, what will work a lot better across regional Australiaâand in particular in smaller centres which are struggling in such difficult economic circumstancesâis an approach where their leadership is developed and honed towards growing their own economies. The role of government in that case is one of assisting that leadership 
 and those attributes of a particular area to develop.</para></talk.start><para>Last time I was talking about the town of Walcha on the New England in New South Wales and how government decisions, state and federal, could mean the difference between the death of that town and dynamic, robust growth. Today I want to start by talking about another small centre, Hamilton, in western Victoria, before going on to looking at a wider region. I visited this area several weeks ago at the invitation of David Hawker who is the member for Wannon. He wanted me to visit in particular the educational facilities in his area. However, I actually managed to get an overview of the area. It is a very interesting contrast to see the ways in which different types of government assistance over time have impacted on the western Victorian district.</para><para>One of the major intervention impacts was in the early 1980s when the then government supported the establishment of the Alcoa aluminium smelter in that region at Portland. The problem with that project was that the government had taken power from the eastern Gippsland area and taken it right across to western Victoria. It was good for regional development in that area, but it raises a question about major government intervention if it then creates a situation that might put a particularly large company at some economic risk.</para><para>What people have to understand about the aluminium smelting process is that aluminium is really just solid electricity. There is so much power going into smelting aluminium that the best and most efficient place to put the smelter is very close to the power stations. The reason why the fourth largest aluminium plant in the world is at Tomago in Newcastle is that there are an enormous number of power stations in that area. Down in Hamilton and in that area in western Victoria we had that type of government intervention, but we really need to develop more than that. Governments cannot save the economy of those regions by constantly putting in large projects because often those larger projects employ only a few hundred people. What we need is a more dynamic, sustainable, grassroots, 
 bottoms-up type approach to support the economy in these areas.</para><para>I went to have a look at what Hamilton had going for it. It was, in the past, a major wool area in this country. I have been to a number of wool areas; they all seem to claim that they are the home of the world's finest wool, and Hamilton was no exception. But of course the wool industry has fallen on hard times, and in a lot of the wool-growing areas and on a lot of grazing land they are growing blue gum timber. It is a very fast growing timber and gets to full maturity in 12 years. That industry employs people when you plant the trees and it employs people when you cut them down, but it does not employ many people in between. So they need to look at their strengths in this small areaâthis town of 10,000.</para><para>When I met with the people thereâI met with the community leaders the night before and then did inspections the next dayâI discovered that Hamilton has a tremendous capacity in the area of education. Not only has it got excellent high schools but also it has an excellent interface between education and the rural industry. It has set up training and extension programs for agriculture that not only serve western Victoria but also serve the whole of Australia. The programs are growing out of that area. The RMIT university has established a centre there for the work and projects of the university which could be extended a lot further to provide education on a more comprehensive basis for people in western Victoria. Other universities have set up campuses on such a basis in some of the smaller centres, and when speaking to the people at RMIT we really encouraged them to do further work in that area.</para><para>But the fascinating thing about education in that area is the high schools. The high schools in that region are unique in that one is a boarding schoolâthe last one west of Melbourne, so it certainly has a comparative advantage thereâand there is a range of high quality private schools. I met with all the principalsâagain, with the local member, David Hawkerâand that seemed to be a necessary catalyst. It was an idea they had thought about for some time, but when we had the meeting all the ideas they had seemed 
 to jell in a cooperative arrangement. So they are going to do cooperative things in marketing, particularly marketing themselves to other countries as an area in regional Australia you can come to to get a high quality high school education and then move on to university. They are also looking at cost sharing in a number of ways, such as across the three schools in subjects that are not in particularly high demand. A number of the languages come to mind: different campuses could offer different languages and then students from the different campuses could, say, attend Indonesian or German or whatever the language class was. You would then get a critical mass in terms of size of class. They are looking at some of the economies in that area. It is a matter of these smaller areas identifying their strengths and then growing those strengths.</para><para>I want to move now to a contrasting area. The resource base of the western Victorian area, particularly Hamilton, was fairly light in terms of its diversity. I will move on to one that has terrific diversity and potential, but it has lost many jobs: I refer to the Upper Hunter. With the downsizing of BHP there has been a major focusâby state and federal governments and all sorts of groupsâon the Lower Hunter and what is happening there. But in the Upper Hunter there are major problems because of the number of ways in which its economy is adjusting and shifting. It is a very strong economy but it is going through a lot of technological change and a lot of adjustments to our competitive market position.</para><para>I want to briefly move through the strengths of the Upper Hunter and the way in which industry is going. Its primary driving force is coal. Coal in the Hunter and the Upper Hunter has a terrifically bright future. This is shown by the fact that the coal loader at Newcastle has been expanded. They would not put $90 million into a new coal loader if they did not think we were going to have increased production. Production will increase, but what is happening is that new mines are opening up and are creating employment but they are high-tech operations and they do not employ as many as the older mines used to employ, and in this highly 
 competitive coal market some of the older, less efficient mines in the same area are shutting down. So you have got mines opening up and mines shutting down, and the net effect is on employment in that, because of high-tech procedures, you have got a drop in the work force.</para><para>The second areaâand it feeds off the coal minesâis power generation. There are two major power plants in the Upper Hunter, including the very high-tech Bayswater Power Station. Again, power has moved into a competitive market. We are competing particularly with Victoria. One of the effects of creating greater efficiencies in a power stationâthis has occurred in the last 18 monthsâis that the number of people it used to take to manage one power station now manage two. The work force has gone from 1,400 to 700 in that time. So that competitive market we have in Australia which is driving down power prices and improving the economy has an effect which we have got to take very much into accountâthe fact that a smaller, more efficient work force creates an employment problem for us.</para><para>The third areaâand I now am moving on to areas where government can actually make a bit of a differenceâis the area of forestry and timber. The regional forest agreements, RFAs, that have been brought in by the Carr government are shutting down major timber towns across the Hunter Valleyâtowns like Dungog, places like Bulahdelah. The focus of quite a number of towns was the timber industry and sawmills in those towns. The way the RFAs have been set up means there is not a sufficient supply of timber for many of those towns, and already the mills are shutting down and people are losing their jobs.</para><para>This is something that, if we got the balance right in terms of sustainable development in timber, we could actually change. People in the Gloucester area in the Hunter Valley have told me, for example, that they had it set up in such a way that they could log timber and not have to return to the same coup for 200 years. That is a sustainable system. But, for some strange reason, in the RFA process in the Gloucester area they 
 locked up so much timber that it has not become viable for that areaâsomething the state governments certainly could do something about in terms of jobs.</para><para>The other area that has been a victim of changing technology and changing markets in the Upper Hunter has been the abattoirs. A high-tech abattoir has been developed at Scone, and that is expanding and doing well. The nearby town of Aberdeen had an older, more inefficient abattoir, which closed with the loss of 450 jobs. This is a one-company town. This was the major job generator in Aberdeen. The state government has tried to come in to assist in various ways, but that abattoir is going to remain closed.</para><para>The state government, which has the primary responsibility for regional development, has had great difficulty in responding in an area of very rapid technological change and very rapidly changing markets. We have in the Hunter the Minister Assisting the Premier on Hunter Development, Richard Face. He set up a beyond 2000 Upper Hunter committee which has been running for two years and was publicised widely in the news a few weeks ago. When asked the basic question, `How many new jobs has the committee generated?' his answer was, `None in that area.' That was a very disappointing outcome.</para><para>One area that has some hope in the Upper Hunterâand it has tended to have some fluctuations over timeâis where federal government involvement occurs with the large military base at Singleton. When I went up to meet the mayors and the general managers I heard that there had been a reduction in activity at the base. But we do have the results before us now of what is actually happening at Singleton, and I am pleased to report that the actual number of training daysâbecause Singleton is a training baseâthe number of personnel involved, the amount spent, all of those things, are very much on the up at the moment. Given the current military situation, I think that is likely to continue. So, there is that base underlying the Upper Hunter.</para><para>The meeting I had with the mayors and with the general managers discussed quite a number of projects. We had a look at some 
 big projects that are coming into the area. The conclusion that we reached, really, was that these create jobs in the hundreds; what is needed is jobs in the thousands. We are only going to get that through involvement and development of small business in that area. In my next speech in this area I will continue with that story.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia</title><title>Victoria: Election</title><page.no>8630</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>8630</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe can look forward to instalment No. 3 in the ongoing saga. I would just like to say to Senator Tierney that I think he is committedâand his aspirations are certainly laudableâin relation to regional development. Certainly we on this side of the chamber would agree that the role of governments is to assist regional Australia. We give them a hand up, not a handout. However, Senator Tierney's aspirations may well be somewhat truncated and limited by the empirical actions of the federal government in this area as exemplified by what I would like to talk about today with regard to what happened in Victoria on Saturday.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>âThat was interesting.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âIt was very interesting, indeed. Probably Senator Tierney and others on the other side of the chamber would have had the degree of prescience necessary to predict it. Certainly Mr Anderson did make a statement several months ago in which he talked about two nations. I think many members of the opposition were concerned about what was going to happen in Victoria. However, from the federal government's perspective, nothing happened in terms of altering the policy paradigm in that respect.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On this historic day, 18 September, the Victorian electorate delivered a very clear message to not only the Kennett government but also the coalition government in terms of rejecting an archaic and outdated approach to regional development policy, something which most of the Western world has rejected. Labor's regional development policy included worthwhile initiatives, such as Working Nation. Regional Victorians said they had had enough of being ignored. They had had 
 enough of being bullied and enough of being completely cut out of the loop in terms of industry regional development employment initiatives. They said enough is enough.</para><para>Anybody with even a passing or cursory interest in the Victorian resultâwhich I imagine would be everybody in the federal parliament and in many state governments and oppositionsâcould not fail to note the reality of what happened in regional Victoria. Regional Victorians quite clearly voted against the Kennett government and its urban-centric policies. When I say `urban-centric', I do not actually mean `urban development'. I am actually talking about a piecemeal approach to urban developmentâwhich we also would not support; we support synergy between regional development policy and urban policyâthat was clearly a policy failure.</para><para>The Kennett government's policies were based on economic rationalism taken to absurd lengths. They took the voters for granted. When the voters voted the way they did on Saturday, they knew precisely what they were doing. I think it is sad that coalition senators, such as Senator Alston, have responded in this chamber by saying, `It was a protest vote. Look who they voted for. Perhaps they woke up on Sunday and wished they had changed their vote.' People in Victoria knew what they were voting for. If you actually have a look at the voting patterns, unusually for state elections, they did not park their vote with the minor parties. They went straight from the coalition to Labor. That was a very clear message. It was not a protest vote; it was a vote for Labor policies. They were clearly sick and tired of the Kennett government's policies, and there is no doubtâI think it has been successively shown by a number of electionsâthat they are also very concerned about, and sick and tired of, the federal coalition's policies.</para><para>The policies of the federal and Victorian state government contributed to high unemployment in Victoria. After seven years of conservative government, 140,000 jobs had been created in Melbourne and only 10,000 in the rest of Victoriaâsomething not lost on regional Victorians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>âHow many have been lost, though, as well?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>âI will get to that, Senator Woodley. There have been massive reductions in state services. For seven years, regional Victorians have endured cuts to health, education and other community services with no real tangible benefit, from their perspective. The government promised imposition of new fees and charges for infrastructure in areas such as regional roads and Catchment Management Authority taxes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Victorian result showed that governments who ignore regional communities do so at their own peril. In fact, in my own state of Tasmaniaâwhich is also your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherryâthat was very clearly shown in the result in the last federal election, which was a vote from regional Australia sending a message to the coalition government.</para><para>Under the coalition government, regional communities have been forced to make large sacrifices for the sake of what is termed `economic responsibility' by economic rationalists and yet they have not seen any real major benefitsâthe benefits have been minor. Voters in Victoriaâand those in the rest of Australia, I suspect, are currently feeling the sameâhave said they are simply not prepared to put up with it any more. They want a hand up, not a handout. It is important to have policies that provide a hand up, and that is what we are missing. There is a policy vacuum.</para><para>The federal government has to take greater notice of the issues facing regional communities. It is simply not possible anymore to transfer policies designed for metropolitan communities to regional areas and hope that no-one notices. There is an absolute truth in the axiom that the problems facing regional Australia are the same but the solutions for regional communities are different. That is the bottom line here and something that was completely lost in terms of the Victorian election. Regional communities expect and deserve elected representatives who will represent their concerns and interests. They demand and deserve policies that respond to their circumstances in a direct way, acknow 
 ledging that there are exigencies in regional Australia with respect to economic and social conditions and that policies are required to target those exigencies.</para><para>One policy which has done untold damage to regional communities is the omnipresent competition policyânot national competition policy in the broad, I hasten to say, because national competition policy does have benefits for everybody, from the big end of town to small rural communities. It is the way it is implemented that is the bottom line here. There is nothing wrong with providing services in an efficient and cost-effective way that has benefits for service providers and for the community. Like a lot of things, NCP delivered wrongly also has major costs. We have yet to see a balanced approach taken with regard to national competition policy to ensure that the community can benefit. Time does not permit me to go into that, but at a later stageâalong with Senator TierneyâI will do a stage 2 which will deal with national competition policy specifically. A lot of it is in relation to how it is interpreted and how it has been mismanaged since the original intention of the policy introduced under Labor.</para><para>In Victoria, the Kennett government has taken competition policy to the absolute extreme. Mr Kennett used national competition policy as a smokescreen to implement what was clearly an ideological agendaâan agenda which has been shown, since Saturday, to be thoroughly rejected by the Victorian electorate. His view was that the power of the market ought to reign supreme, sweeping aside any balanced discussion of the impact on regional communities, benefits and associated costs.</para><para>NCP in Victoria has become synonymous with compulsory competitive tendering and contracting out. CCT is based on the idea of introducing competition to service provision, with the aim of finding the most efficient service provider. Local government has been particularly hard hit in terms of being at the forefront in relation to compulsory competitive tendering, given the plethora of services it provides. These services have been exposed directly to competition policy, which has 
 resulted in major redundancies and contracting out.</para><para>The ASUâthe Australian Services Unionâhas estimated that 15,000 jobs, Senator Woodley, in local government in Victoria have effectively been contracted out. Of these 15,000 jobs, 5,000 have been filled by private contracts, which leaves a final loss of 10,000 jobs. Half of these 10,000 jobsâ5,000âare in regional Victoria. I can imagine that those figures may well be replicated across the board. You can imagineâas Senator Woodley and Senator O'Brien knowâthe impact that job losses have on small regional communities and the impact on the sense of pride of small communities. 	Job losses are not the only cost that has been associated with CCT. A recent study by the Victorian University of Technology unearthed the following costs: significant cost increases associated with the tendering process, often outweighing the proposed savings that are supposed to emerge from CCT; the breakdown of important service synergies like the loss of local knowledge, well-established relationships, informed helping networks and a general sense of community, which is something that regional Australia is very concerned about; the destruction of worker morale and job commitmentâpeople in local communities develop relationships with people who provide services and, when the contracting out occurs on a willy-nilly basis, this is lost; and the loss of information sharing and collaborative participation, particularly in the area of human services. These costs are significant but, here again, that is what the economic rationalist says. What we need to do is have a look at the human face of the costs in terms of service provision.</para><para>As I said before, local government has been forced to carry the costs of CCT in Victoria. There have been some benefits but there have been major downsides, particularly in the area of human services. A survey in 1996 by the Loddon, Buloke and Towong shires of 38 non-metro councils found that 50 per cent of local government respondents reported no savings from CCT at all; 75 per cent of respondents said that CCT had been a net cost to councils. Yet in recent weeks local govern 
 ment has again been forced into a position of uncertainty and caution, this time by the predictable flow-over from the first wave of the federal government's industrial relations laws.</para><para>What has happened as a result of this is that a major anomaly has emerged in relation to CCT that has meant that workers doing identical work could be paid different rates, based on outsourcing and the competitiveness of individual tenders. In effect, local government outsourcing has seen a transfer of work activities from the council to private contractors, usually on a lower wage and usually with worse conditions. This is despite the government's claim that no worker will be worse off in relation to this. That is yet another blatant breach, Mr Acting Deputy Presidentâwhich is no surprise to you or meâof the no-disadvantage test and something which we clearly pointed out in the discussions on the first wave.</para><para>The Federal Court, as we predicted again, has been forced to come in, clarify and clean up another major anomaly in the first wave industrial relations legislation. Recent decisions by the Federal Court have reinforced the finding that outsourcing did involve the transmission of business. Clearly, people are doing the same work when they move from a government instrumentality or a local council to a contractor. Why should they get paid less if it is the same work?</para><para>This decision will impact on up to 40 contractors who deal with municipalities in Victoria alone. The situation is best illustrated with the recent example of home care workers in the Dandenong region of Melbourne. These workers, predominantly women, are a group of unsung heroes. Working in people's homes, isolated from colleagues and performing tasks requiring great compassion, these workers show a commitment and application which would put most of us to shame. Yet when the company Silver Circle won the contract from an internal work force of the Greater City of Dandenong they refused to apply the same conditions. They refused to apply the Victorian Local Government Authorities Interim Award and council's certified agreement to their work force. The 90 home care staff 
 employed by the Greater Dandenong Council had to accept award reductions or lose their jobs. The home care staff refused and the contract was awarded to Silver Circle. Many of the employees of Silver Circle had been performing identical functions but were receiving $2 an hour less, for no good reason whatsoever.</para><para>The ASU, on behalf of its members, sought a Federal Court order forcing Silver Circle to pay its employees the council's and not the inferior conditions and wages it was offering. On 14 September, Silver Circle consented to a court order that recognised that the council award and certified agreement were predominant. Interestingly, the company put up a bit of a fight but, in the end, caved in. It knew that, as a result of a string of Federal Court actions, it had lost the case and it agreed with the ASU on the compromise. I would like to recognise the work of the ASU, particularly that of Brendon O'Connor, the assistant national secretary of the ASU, in relation to his assiduous approach to this matter and, on the broader issue of national competition policy, the other assistant secretary, Tim Lee.</para><para>Obviously the shortcomings of the federal government's legislation have caused all sorts of problems for local government in Victoria. Despite having received the wrong advice, councils have acted responsibly, taking a cautious approach to future outsourcing and seeking to resolve similar cases. We are talking about up to 5,000 local government workers who are affected by this Federal Court decision. Their claims over loss of pay and conditions as a result of contracting out will amount to millions and millions of dollarsânot simply in terms of the impost on the councils but also in terms of the imposts on the contractors themselves. That is an issue we need to bear in mind in terms of a commitment to small business.</para><para>To conclude, here again local government has had to take the brunt of slipshod policies on industrial relations by the government and also of complete myopia by the federal government, in particular by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, who ought to be taking an interest in these matters and ought to be 
 ensuring that industrial relations initiatives which were introduced do not impact in disparate proportion on local government, do not leave them in the lurch and do provide them with a situation where there is sufficient certainty.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jubilee 2000</title><page.no>8634</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>8634</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday in this debate I wish to talk about a worldwide movement known as Jubilee 2000. Recently in the Senate, Senator John Watson spoke on this issue and previously I have also mentioned it. Today I want to bring some more information to the Senate's attention. The movement Jubilee 2000 is based originally on a passage from the Hebrew scriptures in Leviticus 25 which proclaims a number of things. A contemporary version or summary of that passage in Leviticus says:</para></talk.start><para>You shall let the land lie fallow, that is, you shall practise Sabbath; You shall forgive debts, letting forgiveness in: You shall free captives and proclaim liberty; You shall find out what belongs to whom and give it back; You shall hold a great feast, learning to sing the canticles of "jubilate".</para><para>That is a very ancient statement about a vision that the Hebrew people had of what the world would be like if we could do all of those things. But it is interesting that, perhaps almost 3,000 years later, groups as widely diverse as governments, churches and aid organisations have combined around the world to proclaim Jubilee 2000.</para><para>To give the Senate an idea of how many people are involved in this movement, I will read to the Senate from an information document about the coalition that has taken off around the world:</para><para>A powerful group of organisations and churches met in Washington in 1997 to launch Jubilee 2000 in the US. They include Bread for the World, Friends of the Earth, the Fifty Years is Enough campaign, the Sojourners, Witness for Peace, the Methodists, Mennonite and Presbyterian Churches, and the Catholic Bishops Conference. Jubilee 2000 in the USA is conducting a vigorous campaign to persuade members of Congress to back Jubilee 2000.</para><para>It goes on:</para><para>Additional to the nations already mentioned there are currently campaigns in Ireland, Ghana, Zambia, 
 India and Kenya and we are supported by groups in Canada, France, Tanzania, New Zealand, Norway and many other countries.</para><para>A central effort of the worldwide campaign is collecting signatures for the world's largest petition.</para><para>I understand that upwards of 22 million signatures are being collected around the world.</para><para>In Australia, the National Working Group for Jubilee 2000 has representatives from the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, the Social Issues Committee of the Anglican Church, the Australian Baptist World Aid, the Baptist Union of New South WalesâSocial Issues Committee, the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission, the National Council of Churches, TEAR Australia, World Vision, et cetera. It is a very widespread and diverse group who have got together to attempt to proclaim, if you like, a jubilee for the year 2000.</para><para>One of the issues that the Jubilee 2000 movement has taken up is world debt. This is a very critical issue for many nations in the world which have gone past any ability to repay what they owe to creditor nations. In many nations of the world, particularly the poorest nations, debt is absolutely crippling them, not only crippling them in an economic sense but causing great hardship for the populations of those countries. The Jubilee 2000 Charter proposes, amongst other things:</para><para>.	 There is an overwhelming need for remission of the backlog of unpayable debts owed by highly indebted poor countries. Debt remission should relate to commercial, government and IMF/World Bank Debts, and debt reduction would comprehensively include all three forms of debt.</para><para>.	 Creditors as well as debtors must accept responsibility for these high levels of indebtedness.</para><para>.	 The remission should be a one-off, unrepeatable act, tied to the celebration of the new millennium. It would set no precedents for future loans.</para><para>And so it goes on. There is already amongst many of the creditor nations movement through the United Nations for the highest indebted countries to have some relief, but this goes beyond that and seeks to get at the very real problems there are in many of the poor countries of the world.</para><para>Today I want to go a little beyond what has been proclaimed in this worldwide movement because it concentrates on only one principle of Jubilee. I would suggest to the Senate that the other principles of that Jubilee ought also be included. These other principles include, for example, environmental responsibility. `Let the land lie fallow' was the old Hebrew command. Of course, that is more than simply engaging in particular agricultural practices. It goes far beyond that. It is about caring for the land in a global sense, because we understand today that that is the only way we can in fact save this earth from where it is heading if we do not begin to be far more responsible than we have been in past centuries. It is about sustainable agriculture. It is not only for Jews and Christians, for whom this command ought to be a high priority, but for all of the world's people learning to care again for the land and to be responsible.</para><para>It is about freedom from slavery. I guess some people would say, `Well, we got rid of slavery a long time ago.' But we have not. There is the slavery which unemployed people know and understand and live with every day. There is the slavery which is very real around the world where millions of young people, particularly children, act and live and work as slaves. Child labour is a form of slavery.</para><para>Another principle of the Jubilee speaks about the release of prisoners. One of the growth industries in Australia and in many of the developed nations is the building of prisons. We in Australia are all aware of the overrepresentation of indigenous people in our prisons. We are aware of the mandatory sentencing laws in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Particularly in the Northern Territory, those mandatory sentencing laws fall very heavily and overwhelmingly on the indigenous people of that state.</para><para>I want to mention the work of a friend of mine in Brisbane, Father Dick Pascoe, who has worked tirelessly for many years to try to do something about the overrepresentation of indigenous people in prison. He has done this at great personal cost. He has been slammed in the media without any opportunity of giving a proper reply to those who have 
 defamed him. He would be the first one to admit that not all he has done has perhaps been successful but, nevertheless, he has never given up in seeking to proclaim a Jubilee for indigenous prisoners in Queensland. He has sought, as we all ought to do, new ways of dealing with prisons and especially in dealing with proper rehabilitation, which often gets put down to the very bottom of the list when it comes to understanding the way prisons operate, especially in terms of prison budgets. We must take seriously this particular aspect of the Jubilee.</para><para>The Jubilee also talks about the return of land to the original owners. We know that we have a High Court decision in Mabo which forever extinguished the doctrine of terra nullius, but it is quite clear through the mail I get that many people in Australiaâmany groups within Australia, many organisations within Australiaâoperate and speak as though Mabo never happened, as though native title does not exist. Some people complain about the cost of native title. Of course it costs. Over the last 200 years plus it has cost indigenous people an incalculable cost in the loss of land, in the loss of language, in the loss of culture, in the loss of their children, in the loss of hope and in the loss of life itself. The cost for them can never be calculated. Those of us who say that it is costing too much ought to put that cost that we presently may be faced with against the cost to the indigenous people of this country over the last 211 years. We must also commit ourselves therefore to this principle of Jubilee.</para><para>These are the principles of Jubileeânot only the forgiveness of debt but freedom for slaves, the release of prisoners, to take seriously our environmental responsibility and the return of the land to the original owners. It is interesting that that very ancient Hebrew text was updated in the Christian scriptures by Jesus himself, who proclaimed his own Jubilee in exactly the same terms. What I want to say to the Senate today is that in Jubilee 2000 we have an update of 3,000 years of history of a vision which goes back that long of proclaiming to all the world a Jubilee. For the land, for those who are oppressed, for those who are in debt and for 
 those who are in prison there is the possibility of freedom and liberty and a new way of life. In order to update and proclaim Jubilee 2000, there must be a commitment of all to proclaim that Jubilee in the land in which we live and to all the principles of Jubilee:</para><para>You shall let the land lie fallow, that is, you shall practice Sabbath; You shall forgive debts, letting forgiveness in: You shall free captives and proclaim liberty; You shall find out what belongs to whom and give it back; You shall hold a great feast, learning to sing the canticles of "jubilate".</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Constitutional Referendum: Republic</title><page.no>8636</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>8636</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to speak on the matter of the constitutional referendum on the question of Australia becoming a republic. I have taken the view that, in deference to the constituents who have contacted me about this matter, I would state my position on the public record. I would like to thank those who have taken the time to communicate their views to me on this important matter and to let them know that I have thought long and hard about the issues and their ramifications for our nation's future.</para></talk.start><para>I commence by considering the history of the recent debate which has brought us to this referendum. In 1991 the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at the University of Melbourne facilitated a constitutional centenary conference which I had the privilege of attending. The aim of the conference was to initiate debate and raise public awareness of our Constitution as we moved towards its centenary. The issues recommended for review by the constitutional conference were far broader than the single issue of the head of state and covered a range of issues including judicial independence, trial by jury, federalism, protection of rights and the impact of globalisation. The process had strong bipartisan support from the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and the stage was set for a long-term, sensible and mature consideration of our Constitution.</para><para>The whole concept of constitutional change, bubbling and simmering from a groundswell 
 of public information, education and discourse, was something that evoked a strong kinship with our founding federationists. I did not envisage, therefore, a constitutional debate hijacked by a desperate Prime Minister Keating urgently needing to placate the Left and hoping the issue might divide conservative parties. In one fell swoop we moved from bipartisan support for a mature and extended examination of constitutional reform to the single issue of an Australian republic. By railroading the process, Paul Keating set back by years the cause of sensible and constructive debate on constitutional reform. The result has been a divisive constitutional debate and one where the broader issues of reform and community education and consultation have been lost in the `republic before 2000' hyperbole.</para><para>The yes advocates make it sound very simple, but I have concerns with the proposed model. According to some, moving to a republic is a simple task of taking our copy of the Constitution and liquid papering out any and all references to the Crown, sovereign and the Governor-General and replacing them with the phrase `President of Australia'. I am highly sceptical that this can be done whilst retaining our political stability, our constitutional certainty and the soundness of our institutions. Whilst I accept that the transfer of the reserve powers to the President can be achieved through the proposed amendment, I remain unconvinced that the conventions which have governed the behaviour of our governors-general will necessarily follow.</para><para>I have been profoundly disturbed by the lack of appreciation in the current debate of the values imparted by the concept of the Crown within our parliamentary democracy. An examination of our history shows an evolving Australian concept of the Crown which takes the lessons of European history and adapts them to the unique demands of the Australian nation. This ever-evolving Australian concept of the Crown has guaranteed the dignity and freedom of Australians since our inception as a nation.</para><para>Contrary to the easy rhetoric of the republicans, the notion of the Crown in the Australian Constitution is far more than just the 
 person of Elizabeth II. Over the centuries with the passage of time, war, regicide and heated debate has evolved the Westminster system and the constitutional monarchy. The role of the Crown has not only survived but also evolved to become the foundation for a system of democracy which is stable and sound. The Crown has been a solidifying and unifying institution in the Australian Constitution and is removed from the influence of politics and partiality. Yet too often the Crown and the protection it provides to our citizens are disregarded in favour of a confused, simplistic and sometimes petty discussion of the person of the Queen and her heirs.</para><para>Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch who represents the human face of the Crown, just as the Governor-General represents the Queen in Australia. The role of the Governor-General has been a role that has evolved since its inception in 1901. Since 1965 all governors-general have been Australian citizens. The way in which they have seen their role in modern Australia has been different for each Governor-General, but the evolution and the transformation of the role has been a consistent and common feature.</para><para>The Governor-General is entrusted with all the reserve powers of the constitutional monarch. Too often in this debate, the reserve powers have been brushed aside as a technical matter or treated like a nuisance or, at worst, characterised as somehow being undemocratic. The reserve powers are the invisible hand of our constitutional monarchy, regulating the behaviour of those who exercise power over the citizenry and ensuring flexibility in times of crisis. That is what I would emphasise, so I will say it again: the reserve powers are the invisible hand of our constitutional monarchy, regulating the behaviour of those who exercise power over the citizenry and ensuring flexibility in times of crisis.</para><para>It is disingenuous to seek to disentangle the reserve powers from the historical context from which they evolved. We cannot guarantee that, with a stroke of the referendum pen, these conventions will transfer from the old Constitution to the new. We cannot guarantee that a President would be guided by centuries of law and convention which have evolved 
 over a long time. Nor can we guarantee that the tenets of the Westminster system and the inherent impartiality of our present head of state will transfer to a President without diminution. I do not believe that there has been enough debate on the issue of reserve powers and the proposed transferral of these powers to the President, and this is because of what I believe to be a Cinderella mentalityâa determined push by sections of the community to achieve constitutional change before the clock strikes midnight on 31 December 1999.</para><para>A constitution is a living and breathing document that is the essence of the people who live under its laws, institutions and values. Those who argue that to value the current constitutional system is to be out of date or to belong to a bygone era of Mother England are missing the reality that the Australian constitutional monarchyâwith its unique Australian understanding of the Crownâis modern, relevant and evolving. The Statute of Westminster in 1942 and the Australia Acts in 1986 both demonstrate the manner in which the Constitution has adapted and evolved and can continue to adapt and evolve without sacrificing our stability of process and the strength of our institutions.</para><para>For nearly 100 years, Australia has functioned as one of the most modern, relevant and inclusive democracies in the world. Without civil war or widespread national division, our Constitution has accommodated great social and political change with only minimal constitutional hiccups. The guarantee of freedom, dignity and the rule of law which the Crown extends to all Australian citizens has drawn millions of migrants to our shores and improved the quality of life of succeeding generations of Australians, regardless of their country of origin. For these reasons, I will be voting no to a republic in the referendum on 6 November 1999.</para><para>In closing, I would like to make the point that I consider that one of the more disappointing aspects of the debate thus far has been the level of personal vitriol generated by some with opposing views. I do not pretend to be the fount of all wisdom on the issue, neither do I wish to enter into personal attacks on those who have taken a different view. I 
 do not intend to enter into that sort of debate and would like to put on the record my respect for those who have given a great deal of thought to this issue and have been willing to put their views into the public arena, many of whom differ from me in their views. It may well be that history will judge me to have been overly cautious. If the Australian people choose to move to a republic on 6 November, I will commit myself to working hard to ensure a strong and successful Australian republic.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Airservices Australia: Structural Review</title><page.no>8638</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>8638</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe matter I want to talk about today does not deal with the republic at all but deals with public accountability. This government keeps talking about its commitment to reduce the charges it imposes on industry, and that is an appropriate policy objective. Government must provide services as efficiently as it can. A reduction in the costs imposed by government authorities on industries that use their services was a key policy objective of the former government. While I was not part of that government, I think I can fairly claim that both the Hawke and Keating governments were successful in their endeavours.</para></talk.start><para>This government has also talked about the need for transparency of the cost basis for government charges. I also agree with that commitment. It is just as important that governments not only keep charges down but also justify the basis for charges they impose.</para><para>Last year, I asked a question on notice about a review that government had undertaken into the operation of Airservices Australia. That review in fact was completed in March 1998. According to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the purpose of the review was to determine what changes were needed to the structure of the authority to `facilitate the introduction of competition to the potentially commercial functions of the organisation'. I asked for a copy of that report that followed the review, but the minister, Mr Anderson, refused to release the document, as he normally does. Mr Anderson could never be accused of being a supporter of open government. In response to a question on notice, Mr Anderson said:</para><para>The Government has decided not to release the report, and I am not prepared to comment on its findings and recommendations.</para><para>Clearly, the endgame in all of this is the privatisation of Airservices Australia. That means the privatisation of everything, including air traffic control. The government has already attempted to privatise some air traffic services by way of regulation, but the Senate, quite rightly, blocked this move.</para><para>As I said earlier, the claimed objective of the government's strategy generally and in relation to Airservices Australia in particular has been to cut costs and ensure that charges imposed on industry are transparent. It was, therefore, of some concern to me and, I am sure, the aviation industry when details of the salaries paid to managers and other staff in Airservices Australia were leaked to the media. This information was obviously leaked by someone who considers the salaries paid to some officials are difficult to justify.</para><para>I was asked to comment on those alleged salariesâand I say `alleged' because I understand that the chair of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth, has claimed that the schedule of salaries that has appeared in the media is not accurate. I look forward with considerable interest to Mr Forsyth releasing an accurate schedule of senior executive salaries to correct the record, if such a correction is required. In fact, I invite him to do so.</para><para>It is important to note that Airservices Australia is accountable to the minister and the parliament through the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It should also be accountable to the industry it serves and the Australian travelling public, who, through their tickets, ultimately fund its operations. That is the point I made to a journalist from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> who wrote a story about this matter. If Airservices is paying its executives very large salaries, it must be able to justify those salaries.</para><para>The list of salaries paid to Airservices staff, which, as I said, somehow found its way out of that organisation and into the media, contained some very big numbers indeed. The minister has advised me that Airservices has initiated a full investigation into the leaking of the management salaries. The Manager, 
 Corporate Security, Mr Peter Beaver, is undertaking the investigation. That inquiry was initiated by the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Pollard. Mr Anderson has advised that he expects the Beaver inquiry to be complete and a report with Mr Pollard by the end of this month. Clearly, both Minister Anderson and Airservices are very sensitive about the fact that these salary packages were made public, and one cannot be surprised at that.</para><para>Some time prior to the Airservices management packages being exposed through the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline>, I placed on notice a question not about salary packages but about salary increases paid to Airservices executives. I asked how many increases in salaries or related benefits senior Airservices Australia officers had received since July 1995. I thank the minister for providing me with a prompt answer. I will not go through all of the information provided in that answer, but I want to highlight certain information contained in it. I might add that the answer itself generates a large number of issues, and the minister can, therefore, expect a large number of follow-up questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> shortly.</para><para>The Chief Executive and Managing Director, Mr Pollard, was appointed to that position in November 1995. He received a salary increase on 6 November 1996, on 6 November 1997 and again on 6 November last year. I will be interested to see if Mr Pollard receives a further increase in his salary on 6 November this year. The minister refuses to tell the parliament the quantum of each of these increases. According to the list of salaries that I referred to earlier, Mr Pollard currently earns $329,000 a year. I assume, again, that Mr Forsyth will correct this number if it is wrong.</para><para>The General Manager, Corporate and Employee Relations received a pay rise on 1 July 1996 and another one on 14 May 1997, after what is described by the minister as a scope change. On 1 July 1997, just 47 days later, the General Manager, Corporate and Employee Relations received another salary increase. Then he received another increase on 1 July last year. The basis of all these increases, according to Mr Anderson, was 
 independent advice from Mercers Cullen Egan Dell, the average weekly ordinary time earnings index and a performance appraisal by the Chief Executive Officer. The final decision of salary increases for this position rests with Mr Pollard, not with the board of Airservices. According to the list, this position currently attracts a salary of $256,214.</para><para>The position of General Manager, Air Traffic received a pay rise on 1 July 1996, 14 May 1997, 1 July 1997 and 1 July last year. The basis for the increases, according to Mr Anderson, was, again, independent advice from Mercers Cullen Egan Dell, the average weekly ordinary time earnings index and a performance appraisal by the Chief Executive Officer. Again, it was Mr Pollard who had the final say on whether or not a salary increase was granted.</para><para>The General Manager, Planning and Development has also done very nicely. She received a pay increase on 1 July 1995, 1 July 1996, 1 July 1997 and 1 July 1998. According to the list I referred to earlier, she currently receives $276,229 per annum. In the context of these salaries, it is salutary to recall that, as I understand it, the Prime Minister's salary is in the vicinity of $205,000.</para><para>My understanding of the workplace relations regime under this government is that increases in salaries must be directly linked with increases in productivity. That is the key objective, as I understand it, of the Workplace Relations Act. But the increases in salaries paid to managers in Airservices Australia appear to be based largely on increases in average weekly earnings and an index provided by Mercers Cullen Egan Dell, which I understand to be related to surveys of executive salariesâin other words, so-called comparative wage justice, something that is not available to the ordinary work force.</para><para>These increases appear to be locked in. They are granted on the same date each year. Accountability, in terms of an appraisal of the performance of these managers and the basis of increased salaries based on productivity gains, apparently rests entirely with the Chief Executive Officer. His only obligation is to consult with the Airservices board in relation to the principles that apply to salary packages. 
 I asked the minister whether there was any obligation on Airservices Australia to advise the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business of the quantum and basis for each salary increase. Mr Anderson advised no, even though Airservices is a government authority. He said this was not a requirement on Airservices Australia.</para><para>So what we appear to haveâand the government can clarify this issue quite easily by telling the parliament how much these senior public servants are paid and what the quantum of increases in their salaries has been since July 1995âis a process of remuneration in Airservices that is not open to any sort of scrutiny at all, and it is the industry, and therefore ultimately the travelling public, who must pay the cost.</para><para>I remind the Senate that earlier this year the government increased the avgas and avtur levies, despite having made promises to reduce them. According to the government, the additional funding was to meet the shortfall in the aviation industry's contribution to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's aviation safety programs. The reality is that CASA had overspent, and the government simply went back to the industry and extracted more money from it to meet the shortfall. The government also imposed a temporary surcharge on all aviation fuels. What for? To boost the Airservices budget. The government blamed the Senate for the increased levy because it would not allow the government to privatise air traffic services. That, I might say, was little more than a crude attempt to link a budget shortfall with an issue of public safety.</para><para>In conclusion, I will quote the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. In his 1999 corporate affairs oration, he quoted Milton Friedman:</para><para>In a free enterprise, private property system, a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business . . . in so far as his actions, in accord with his social responsibility, reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their money. In so far as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customer's money. In so far as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âMilton Friedman said that? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>âThat was indeed the Prime Minister quoting Milton Friedman. One only need reflect on that statement when wondering just why we do not get more information on this situation. This is about accountabilityâaccountability of Airservices Australia to this parliament and, through that, accountability to the aviation industry and the travelling public, who must pay the bills.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.47 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>8640</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business Tax Reform: Research and Development </title><page.no>8640</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8640</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Minchin, Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Is it not the case that, by retaining the R&amp;D tax concession of 125 per cent while reducing the company tax rate to 30 per cent, the government has cut the real value of the R&amp;D tax concession by one-sixth? Given the substantial falls in business expenditure on R&amp;D since your 1996 cut to the R&amp;D tax concession, did your department make any assessment of the implications for business expenditure on R&amp;D of this further cut in the value of R&amp;D tax concession? Will the minister release any such assessment?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8640</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhen we came into government we found we had a $10,000 million deficit and massive debt. We also found that we had significant rorting of the R&amp;D tax concession involved in the process of syndication. Unlike the Labor Party, which sat around for 13 years doing nothing, we acted when we came to office both to correct the problems in the deficit and to remove the rorting involved in syndication. That involved a cut in the R&amp;D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. It was a necessary action to ensure the sharing of the burden of dealing with Labor's incredibly irresponsible approach to the deficit.</para></talk.start><para>I might point out that it costs $300 million annually to restore the 150 per cent tax concession. Labor has not made any attempt to indicate how on earth they are going to find $300 million to put the tax concession back up to 150 per cent. They just blandly 
 say, `Put it back to 150 per cent.' Nowhere do they say how that is going to be paid for.</para><para>What we have done is to provide to business the most fantastic reforms of business tax ever in this country, something Labor did not do in its 13 years. We are reducing the company tax rate to 30 per centâone of the lowest tax rates in our region and one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world.

There are a whole range of reasons why business expenditure on R&amp;D has fallen. One is the low commodity prices in the minerals sector.

Madam Deputy President, I think the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  got it right today when one of their major headlines said `An overwhelmingly positive climate for investment'. What the Treasurer announced yesterday was the third plank in the historic overhaul of the taxation system by the 
 government. This overhaul will create an environment for Australia to achieve higher growth and, more importantly, will lead to job creation. Furthermore, the review of business taxation aims to provide a sustainable revenue base so that the government can continue to deliver services to the community.</para></talk.start><para>Yesterday the Treasurer announced the government's business taxation proposals, as recommended by the Ralph committee, to lower the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 34 per cent in the 2000-01 financial year and to 30 per cent thereafter. As Senator Minchin just mentioned to the Senate, this represents one of the lowest company tax rates in our region. The United States has a 35 per cent rate; New Zealand, a 33 per cent rate; Japan, 42; and Canada 44.</para><para>Our capital gains tax regime will also be overhauled. For individuals, only 50 per cent of the capital gains are to be effectively taxed, with the result that the highest rate of tax for individuals will effectively be 24.25 per cent. As for superannuation funds, only two-thirds of capital gains will be taxed, which will mean a concessional rate of 10 per cent.</para><para>To move to the second part of the senator's question, about the community reaction to the tax package, it is true that there was an overwhelming response and that the response was overwhelmingly favourable to what the government announced yesterday. For example, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia said that the government response to Ralph is `fair and balanced' and that super fund members will gain through only two-thirds of capital gains being taxed. The Investment and Financial Services Association says that overall the review has `produced a set of proposals that will greatly enhance the capacity of the economy to produce improved savings and investment results.'</para><para>The Australian Industry Group says that on early examination they believe that it represents a `generally positive and balanced approach to business tax reform.' And so the story goes on. The Financial Planning Association of Australia applauds the government's support for investors through tax reform. The Australian Society of CPAs says that small business and small investors 
 are `winners' from Ralph. Importantly, the National Farmers Federation has indicated that most of Australia's farmers will be more competitive because they will be operating under a simpler and fairer system.

We want to see people, with the incentives available, to really get in there and commercialise new ideas. It is not a matter of just talking about them, of getting out to the John Curtin Hotel and saying, `Isn't it a good idea that we could punish some of these people who have been earning too much money. We will take their capital gains away from them.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are particularly concerned to ensure that the industries that have enormous potential in this country are not handicapped by an out of date and outmoded taxation system. The reforms that were announced yesterday have received very widespread support. Merrill Lynch Asset Management said that these are very favourable tax reforms. Clearly, they build on the Prime Minister's plans to encourage investment. Australia's IT&amp;T communications sector is an engine of growth. Arthur Anderson's corporate tax partner said that the concessions for the foreign pension funds really make Australia competitive with the ordinary tax rules in America, the UK and other major countries.</para><para>The CGT rates are enormously important if we are to stimulate investment in areas where there is normally a higher degree of risk attached. The rewards are there, but there has been a degree of conservatism displayed over a number of years, particularly by Australian superannuation funds. Certainly the US pension funds and other major pension funds around the world have treated Australia as a no-go area as the rates are punitive. They have made that abundantly plain on a number of occasions. We have had discussions with some of the leading pension funds to address this issue.</para><para>I will pick up on the point about Labor's approach to this issue. At the last election when they were busy trying to introduce a whole range of other highly unpopular tax reforms they proposed that they would allow overseas funds, in concert with Australian investors, to invest through a limited number of tightly regulated, approved venture capital 
 funds which would be required to place emphasis on start up and early stage development.</para><para>Where you draw those boundary lines would be an absolute nightmare. But critically important, what they were proposing was that US pension funds could not make their own decisions. They had to do it in conjunction with Australian super funds. In other words, they were playing the old protection game.

In other words, completely removing the flexibility from investors who want to make intelligent decisions on the merits and who might want 20 or 30 per cent or, on the other hand, might want 100 per cent. If that is the way in which they need to be persuaded to invest, then that is the degree of maximum flexibility that they ought to be allowed. That is what our system will permit. That is not what Labor was prepared to countenance. Once again, they were trying to tie one hand behind the back, trying to dictate how they should do it, in conjunction with whom they should do it and, in all sorts of ways, guarantee that the system simply would not work.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is perfectly clear that there is overwhelming support for our proposal. Labor tried the Management and Investment Companies Program, which did not work. They had 13 years to tackle all these issues and simply did not.

Now we are moving to a regime where we are taxing the nominal rates at a lower rate. We think this is a very positive move. In fact, I have to say this move has been very widely welcomed throughout the community, particularly in the press.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murray asked why we are doing this. We believe that Australia needs a more internationally competitive tax regime and that is one of the moves which will help encourage that. We also believe that, by these changes in capital gains tax, we will encourage people to save and invest. We think that is very positive; it is extremely positive for jobs. With these changes, we cut down on a whole host of red tape as well. To be quite frank, these changes are very positive. It is worth noting, as I mentioned in the answer to Senator Cook, that this will produce more revenue not less because it leads to a more efficient system.</para><para>Self-funded retirees will benefit very substantially under the tax package, and self-funded retirees vary from those on high incomes to those on comparatively low incomes. Let me just list, apart from the change we made in the capital gains tax, some of the other areas where self-funded retirees will benefit. First of all, we are cutting income tax rates, which is a big plus. Again, I do not think there is any proposal around this chamber to raise those rates. We are delivering the largest tax cuts in Australian history.</para><para>One of the other very important factors in this which has been particularly welcomed by self-funded retirees is refundable imputation credits. This is one of the key demands from the self-funded groups. They have wanted the government for many years to move on this front to provide refundable imputation credits, and that is precisely what we have provided. Another big plus for self-funded retirees out of the government's overall tax reform package is the health insurance rebate, which 
 again was a big demand from many people in the self-funded retiree area.</para><para>So there are many big pluses in this package for self-funded retirees, indeed for all Australians. Senator Murray mentioned that there would be a different rate between income and capital. That is not atypical around the world in tax systems. Australia wanted to adopt world's best practice and we particularly wanted a tax system which encourages people to save and invest. That is precisely what we have done with this tax package and with the other reforms we have announced in the area of income tax and indirect taxation.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8646</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister, for your answer. I think, in summary, the equity issue will need further exploration. The minister would be aware that the abolition of indexing and averagingâwhich he mentionedâpays for only about 60 per cent of the cost of cutting capital gains tax for individuals, with the remaining $500 million coming from so-called extra capital gains. Isn't it the case that, if that money fails to arrive or if the Treasury estimate of tax avoidance through lower capital gains ends up an underestimate, then the capital gains tax cut is not funded and it would then just represent a net loss and a windfall tax cut to higher income earners?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8646</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn response to Senator Murray's question, the figures we announced yesterday were figures which were prepared by the Ralph committee.

 extensive assessment. It was required to accelerate its analysis to meet World Trade Organisation requirements. The process was transparent. It invited submissions from interested stakeholders and took into account the scientific issues raised by those stakeholders. It announced revised quarantine access policies for salmonoid products, non-viable fish, marine fin fish and live ornamental fish on 19 July last. And the policies are based on an extremely comprehensive and thorough import risk analysis process using the most up-to-date scientific information and the input of 14 independent Australian and international experts. It is the most intensive study of fish quarantine conducted by a quarantine service. It follows from all that that the measures announced by AQIS bring Australia's quarantine controls into conformity with our obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation, and we will continue to adhere to those obligations.</para></talk.start></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8648</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMadam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Two great sectors of this economy have borne the brunt of Australia's horse and buggy tax system. They are manufacturing and mining. Manufacturing and mining, in particular, have had to wear the load of the wholesale sales tax which, for reasons that are completely inexplicable, the Labor Party seems to think is such a wonderful taxâshared only by the Solomon Islands and a few others, of course. We have recognised that the tax system is putting a completely unfair burden on manufacturing and mining in this country. That is why we have reformed our indirect tax system, and that is why we announced yesterday major reforms to Australia's business tax system. They will, in combination, represent and mean a very big boost for mining and manufacturing, for investment and exports and, most particularly, for employment in these two key sectors.</para></talk.start><para>The manufacturing sector get the benefit of the drop in the company tax rate to 30 per cent by 2001. They lose absolutely the burden of the wholesale sales tax. Fuel costs are reduced; compliance costs are reduced. Our tax reforms are terrific news for the 85 per cent of manufacturing enterprises that qualify for the new simplified tax system and retention of accelerated depreciation. In relation to the car industry, we have rejected the Ralph committee's recommendation that the FBT arrangements be modified in a way that we believe will damage that vital industry.</para><para>Research by the economic modellers Econtech shows that manufacturing output will increase by three per cent as a result of our tax reform initiatives. Output in the mining sector is going to increase by over six per cent as a result of our tax reforms. Mining also gets the benefit of our cuts to the company tax rate. They retain the benefits of the deductibility of the removal of mining overburden, prospecting and exploration. They remain immediately deductible. Probably the best news for mining is that, from 1 July 
 2001, deductibility for so-called black hole expenditures like export market development, mine closures and defending native title claims will be immediately deductible, which the mining industry has been seeking for years. As the Treasurer said, we will be retaining and enhancing for major, long-life capital intensive projects the strategic investment incentive process, with particular regard to investment allowances, on a case by case basis.</para><para>Eighty per cent of mining companies in this country have an annual turnover of less than $1 million. That 80 per cent will still retain the benefits of accelerated depreciation and will also get the new simplified tax system. Of course, mining loses the costs of the WST, fuel taxes and other taxes. The reaction from both sectors has been positive.

You would know that reservists, as Senator Hogg knows, are very honourably represented amongst the ranks of the medical corps. In fact, specialists in particular come almost exclusively from the reservists. That has been the case for a long time, too. We currently have reservists in the medical corps serving on Bougainville, but the longstanding call-out legislation, which allows for a reserve to be called out in the defence of Australia or in a declared defence emergency, does not 
 apply in East Timor. Reservists are able to serve on deployment in other positions within the ADF after volunteering for full-time service. That is how we have reservists in Bougainville at the moment. The health support to the Australian members is integral to the operation, and the processes that have been put in place are good to ensure optimum health preparedness for the deploying ADF personnel.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Pre-deployment briefings on current health intelligence, specifically on the environmental and situational health threats that are, or may be, present in Timor have been given to all deploying ADF personnel. Pre-deployment medical and fitness screening is mandatory. Only those persons who are fully vaccinated and operationally fit have been deployed. All deploying ADF personnel have been given antimalarial medication, which will be resupplied as required by the ADF medical facility deployed to East Timor. All deployed ADF personnel have received basic first aid training, and all units have ready access to advanced life support trained medical personnel. To minimise disease and injury threats, preventative medicine trained personnel are being deployed to East Timor.

Secondly, does the minister recall the warning from Australia's Army Land Commander, General Hartley, earlier this year about the critical shortage of medical specialist personnel in the ADF? Why didn't the government respond to that warning instead of denying the shortage, as the Minister for Defence did in parliament last month?

I will ask Mr Anderson if he is aware of it. This question follows on from a matter that Senator Woodley raised with me a couple of days ago when he asked me if I was concerned about the fact that BASI had not released its final report into the G airspace demonstration. As I indicated then, we are not concerned as a government. The G airspace report is a very important one on a very complex matter and it has required a great deal of investigation and analysis. It will be released towards the end of this year. So it will be finished within about a year of when the investigation actually started. That time frame, I am told, Senator Woodley, is entirely normal. You might recall that BASI's investigation into the Monarch Airlines crash in 1993 took just over 12 months and the investigation into a near miss at Sydney airport in 1991 took some 18 months. So the length of time that it has taken for BASI to complete its report into the G airspace demonstration is not unusual.</para></talk.start><para>I am sure that Senator Woodley, as someone who follows these things, will appreciate that it takes some time to put together a detailed, professional and definitive air safety report.

So it is no wonder we could support them.</para><para>In today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in the opinion pages, the distinguished economic columnist Alan Kohler had this to say about the government's tax package:</para><para>Treasurer Peter Costello has pioneered a new technique in tax policy announcement: you defer the nasty measures for "further consideration" but still count the proceeds from them.</para><para>That is indeed a view that could easily be formed. When we look at the measures that have been deferred, we find that, to meet the need of this package to be self-funding, there is a $3.8 billion shortfall. Between the measures being offered in the package and the measures taken to fund the changes being made there is a $3.8 billion shortfall.</para><para>This is a serious matter of great consequence because, if business pays $3.8 billion less in tax, who makes up the difference? Ordinary taxpayers on wages and salaries in Australia make up the difference. If this difference is not made up from within business tax, who pays the burden? Ordinary Australians do, and there is a massive shift from the business sector to ordinary PAYE taxpayers. That is why it is very important that the government answer questions about who will pay, where the money will come from and whether they can assure us that ordinary taxpayers will not be slugged again in order to compensate for cuts in business taxation. </para><para>My question was about the Ralph report's estimate of a $500 million loss to revenue because of personal income taxes being taxed higher than the income through capital gains, and I referred to attachment T of the government's own document. The Assistant Treasurer could not tell us today or, if he did know the answer, declined to tell the Senate whether or not the figure of $500 million identified in the Ralph report is included in that attachment to the government's own 
 report. Now, $500 million is not a trifling amount. Surely the minister can tell us that. He did not even take it on notice. He should come back and tell Australia, through this chamber, what the facts are on that matter.</para><para>But, worse still, the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Alston, did not explain whether the Prime Minister endorses massive tax avoidance by the wealthyâthe top one per cent of income earners in Australiaâbecause in this package they are let off. If there is one way of paying for tax changes, it is by slugging tax avoiders. Because the government remains quiet on this pointâit will not say what it is prepared to doâa huge question mark is left that maybe ordinary wage and salary earners are going to have to make up the difference, because the government does not have the courage or the desire to take on tax avoidance in Australia. They are significant issues that require an answer. Because the government knows its own package and declines to answer, the only conclusion one can come to is that it is hiding here. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>8656</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs usual, we get nothing but criticism from the Labor Party when any reform is undertaken or initiated by this government. We heard some encouraging noises from Senator Cook's colleague in the other placeâthe shadow Treasurer, Mr Creanâlast night following the announcement of this much needed business tax reform package. But, in a sense, it is faint praise because as soon as they acknowledge the need, to a degree, and acknowledge some of the benefits that will accrue from this tax reform package, they are back to their old carping criticism.</para></talk.start><para>What is the essence of the criticisms we have heard from Senator Cook? One of the claims he made is that this package is not revenue neutral. I think the Treasurer himself has acknowledged that there might be an approximately $1 billion shortfall in terms of the revenue raised by the current tax system in the business sector as against the proposed reforms. When you are talking about a budget of some $150 billion or moreâas in the current federal budgetâ$1 billion in relative 
 terms is neither here nor there. As was pointed out by economic experts yesterday, it is also well within any margin of error in terms of doing calculations on reforms of this nature.</para><para>For the Treasurer to acknowledge the possibility of a $1 billion shortfall is, in reality, neither here nor there. It does not take into account the incentive effects of this new tax structure for business. The Treasurer in his assessments has not taken any account of the incentive effects of the change to business taxation because you cannot measure those in this situation. But, of course, there will be incentive effects from business tax reform: there will be more growth and there will be more employment which, in itself, has beneficial revenue effects.</para><para>The reality is that over timeânotwithstanding these changes to taxation in relation to business: lower tax rates for business, reducing the company tax rate from 36 cents in the dollar down to 30 cents in the dollar and halving the capital gains tax rateâit is highly likely that more revenue rather than less revenue will be raised. So that really obliterates the point Senator Cook is trying to make on the revenue issue.</para><para>He also raised the issue as to the tax rate for capital gains tax. He claims that because capital gains tax will now be effectively taxed at half the rate that income is taxed, that is somehow unfair. What Senator Cook firstly ignores is that, in the main, capital gains are achieved from assets that are purchased from after tax income, by and large, particularly by individuals. What often happens is that individuals save their after tax income, purchase assets of one form or another with that after tax income and then at some later date may realise a profit on those assets. So to relate the tax rate that you might apply to those assets to the income tax rate is a fallacious argument because, as I have already pointed out, it is after tax dollars in the main that contribute to the accumulation of those assets.</para><para>But the more important point is that, in terms of the overall welfare of Australians, it is important that our capital gains tax regime be equivalent to that applied by other similar countries around the world. Even with this 
 great cut to capital gains taxâit has been cut in halfâour rate will still be higher than that of some of our competitors. But at least we are now competitive. The cut will, I think, mean that our rate is only one or two per cent, on average, higher than that of the United States, for instance. That is an important factor when we talk about attracting development capital to this country, because one of the main disincentives to development capital coming into Australia has been our punitive rate of capital gains tax. Unless we urgently implement reforms in that area, capital which is much needed for development in Australia will stay away.</para><para>Senator Cook has raised this issue of the relative rate of tax between capital gains and income, but it is not relevant because of the after tax savings that go into capital gains. But, more importantly, in terms of the welfare of all Australians and in terms of the capacity for our economy to expand and create more jobs and create higher incomes for Australians, it is absolutely essential that we have a much lower rate of capital gains tax to encourage that investment and growth in development. That is exactly what the government is doing here. If any criticism could be made of these changes, it is that they do not go far enough, not that they go too far, as Senator Cook would have us believe. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>8657</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take note of the answers given by ministers about the government's proposal for business tax reform. As someone who comes from a manufacturing baseâI spent all my life in the manufacturing industry and the manufacturing sectorâI, like the shadow treasurer, welcome the proposals for reform in the areas of capital gains tax and provision of funds for venture capital. They are long overdue. There is, however, nothing new about the proposals for reforming this area. It is not something that John Ralph suddenly discovered over the past 12 months, it is not something that the Treasurer suddenly discovered over the past 12 months, and it is not something that this government suddenly discovered over the past 12 months; it is an issue that has been on the table in the forefront of debate on manufactur 
 ing, mining and the development of our economy for several years.</para></talk.start><para>I recall tabling a report in this chamber in September 1997, a report called <inline font-style="italic">Rebuilding Australian Industry</inline>, produced by my old union, which contained several similar recommendations on this area. I recall, in the very early stages after my election to the Senate, participating in the production of a report by the Senate Economic References Committee. <inline font-style="italic">Creating opportunities: promoting Australian industry</inline> was the title of the report. It carried a number of recommendations which went to capital gains tax reform, provision of venture capital funds and a range of other mechanisms to encourage and develop our industrial base. So there is nothing new about these issues.</para><para>Senator Alston is, I notice, still in the chamber. He keeps talking about the ALP being a policy free zone. But Senator Alston and his colleagues had no difficulty picking up the 1998 ALP policy platform and ripping out the provisions for changes to capital gains tax to encourage investment in this country and ripping out the proposals for changing the rules facilitating investment of American industry funds in our venture capital industry. Those proposals were there in the early part of 1998; they were adopted by the party in 1997. You do not have any difficulty, Senator Alston, taking those policies from the ALP that you think are useful to you and your government. I presume if you look at a number of your other reforms you will see that some of them are contained within ALP policy.</para><para>But I specifically want to raise a couple of issues arising out of the report yesterday. The first one is capital gains tax reform. One of the concerns that I have is that there has been no modelling done by the Treasury or by anyone else of the changes that are being proposed to capital gains tax to see whether or not, at the end of the day, they will result in productive investment in the Australian economy. There has been no modelling to see whether or not the reforms that are being put in place will result in funds finding their way through to investment in industriesânew industries, new production lines, new forms of manufacturing or new goods and ser 
 vicesâwhether they will find their way back into bricks and mortar or whether they will find their way into further investment, more rapid investment or more rapid turnover of shares on the stock market, which only inflates the value of companies that currently exist. That has not been modelled. That has not been put to the test. The umpire is still out on that issue. In terms of revenue neutrality I just want to quote briefly what the Treasurer himself said in his press release. He said:</para><para>It is expected that the second stage measures recommended by the Report (and not ruled out today) will be adopted to reduce the cost of the package in the outyears in accordance with the goal of revenue neutrality.</para><para>He has conceded in his own press release that the package will not be revenue neutral, except in the year 2000. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>8658</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI offer my good friend and colleague Senator George Campbell congratulations for at least sticking to the subject. It looked as though he had done a bit of preparation before he came here. But I wonder how long Senator Cook's staff spent trying to find the one comment in this morning's newspapers which made some slight criticism. It seems to be a new Labor Party tactic to quote commentators or newspapers. We heard Mr Beazley and Senator Faulkner yesterday quoting ad nauseam from commentary in the newspapers in relation to the motion on East Timor. While Senator Cook's staff were wading through volumes of paper this morning in order to find the one comment that might suit his argument, I wonder how on earth they went past the media release from the Certified Practising Accountants, where Angela Ryan said:</para></talk.start><para>"The government appears to have heeded the call from small business who are drowning in red tape,"</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Taken together, these capital gains tax reforms will make investment in small business a much more attractive proposition, and should assist in the growth and employment generating capacity of the economy as a wholeâthe sort of efficiency gains the Ralph review was aiming for.</para><para>I wonder why Senator Cook's staff went straight past that press release.</para><para>Then there was the press release from the Investment and Financial Services Association, entitled `Good news for saving and investment'. Their CEO, Lynn Ralph, said:</para><para>Overall, the Review has produced a set of proposals that will greatly enhance the capacity of the economy to produce improved savings and investment results.</para><para>I wonder how Senator Cook's staff went past that media release. Then there was the voice of superannuation, ASFAâwho have not always been that complimentary towards the government, I can promise youâwhich said that the Ralph outcome was largely `balanced and positive'. That is the greatest endorsement you could ever get from ASFA. They said:</para><para>. . . the government's response to it has been hailed as positive and balanced . . . </para><para>I wonder how Senator Cook's staff went straight past that press release or the one from the National Farmers Federation, which said:</para><para>Farmers relieved over Ralph CGT decision.</para><para>In fact, the National Farmers Federation in their press release are totally positive and support the government's position.</para><para>I wonder how Senator Cook's staff happened to go past the press release of the Taxation Institute of Australia. What do they have to say? They said:</para><para>Ralph's Revolution creates a brave new world for Australian business.</para><para>I have never heard Senator Conroy commenting on, or giving any credit to, all of these people who have put out press releases yesterday, all in support of the positive moves that have been made by the government in relation to the Ralph report. I just do not know how Senator Cook's staff can retain their jobs if they walked past that press release. Then we have one from the Australian council of university presidents:</para><para>Ralph creates the climate for stronger venture capital investment in R&amp;D.</para><para>What did Senator Cookâand Senator Conroy in his questionâhave to say about research and development? Here the Australian council of university presidents claim that the Ralph report and the government's decision will create a climate for stronger venture capital investment and R&amp;D. I am sure that Senator 
 Conroy's staff would have gone straight past that press release too, because it would have not have suited his argument. Senator Cook's staff, once again, went straight past that one.</para><para>I have not got time to go through them all, but let me say that the Australian Industry Group, one of the major bodies, also welcomed the Ralph report. The Taxation Institute again talks about small business being a `big winner under business tax reforms'. I wonder whether I should post all of these press releases around to Senator Cook's office, because it is obvious that they were not received by his staff. When they searched through to find Alan Kohler's comment, they must have gone straight past that press release. The Certified Practising Accountants again said:</para><para>Small business and small investors the winners . . .</para><para>We are looking after small businesses and small investors, because they are so important to Australia's economy. Then we have the media release from IFSA, which said:</para><para>Good news for savings and investment.</para><para>We have Senator Cook coming into this place and providing us with one quote from one commentator. If he is going to be consistent, the way the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Faulkner were yesterday, he should quote the lot. They were prepared to quote the lot yesterday; how about quoting the lot today? I hope Senator Conroy is going to be the next speaker. I am not sure whether he is on or not but, if he is, I am quite sure that he will want to pick up on those endorsements from practically every commentator in Australia in relation to this important report that was released yesterday. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>8659</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am hoping that Senator Ferguson will stay, because selective quoting is something he has been guilty of before, and I am afraid he has been at it again today.

Did you miss it? It said that the new business tax system unveiled yesterday is a:</para><para>. . . triumph of smoke, mirrors and . . . political tap dancing.</para><para>Then you go to Tom Allard in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> . The headline reads "`Heroic' hope for revenue balance". Here is where the deceit in this package is. Mr Allard says:</para><para>The Federal Government has relied on . . . an "heroic" assumption that halving capital gains tax (CGT) will cost little in lost revenue to achieve in part its aim of revenue neutrality.</para><para>The government wants to say there is a dividend: `When we cut the capital gains tax, there will be a spurt of activity and all of this extra revenue will come in.' Those of you who have followed economics for a while may have heard of Mr Laffer and the Laffer curve in supply-side economics. They ran a huge deficit in America and it is largely discredited.</para><para>On the one hand, the government is prepared to argue that it will gain revenue because of this which will offset the losses from the lower rate so that it is a neutral thing. But what it will not acknowledgeâand what Mr Costello yesterday in his press conference refused to acknowledgeâis that there is now a massive incentive to set yourself up so that you can minimise your tax and have your income in the form of assets, so that when you make capital gains on it you then pay less tax. The revenue neutrality argument on the GST makes the assumption that there is no behavioural change on the income tax side.</para><para>If you are prepared to believe in that, you believe in the tooth fairy, because the whole reason capital gains tax was introduced in 1985 was the rorts that the wealthy in this country were pulling to avoid income tax. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say there is a positive behavioural impact from lowering the rates and no negative impact from the income tax revenue collections. These are two conflicting assumptions. You know they are conflicting and you do not 
 care. These figures are as others have described themârubbery.</para><para>Brian Toohey is another one that perhaps Senator Ferguson did not bother to read this morning as he quoted ad nauseam from all of the Liberal stooges out there.

 Services. However, it is indeed very necessary and will serve to highlight the hypocrisy the Australian Democrats have displayed on this issue and many others to do with superannuation recently. Labor's amendment is essentially the same motion which Senator Allison gave notice of in this place on 9 March this yearâthat is, the original Democrat motion.</para></talk.start><para>Since that time, much has happened. Many hours have been spent negotiating the terms of reference for the establishment of this fine committeeâterms of reference which could be accepted by all political parties. Senator Allison's original motion to re-establish the superannuation committee was broad ranging but contained a number of elements which the opposition was eager to see examined by the committee. The motion stated:</para><para>	 (a)	 the adequacy of the tax system and related policy to address the retirement income and health care needs of Australians into the new millennium;</para><para>	 (b)	 strategies for building more effective national retirement income and long-term saving outcomes;</para><para>	 (c)	 reforms that could be implemented following the completion of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge phase-in to 9 per cent;</para><para>	 (d)	 the taxation of superannuation, particularly the Superannuation High Income Earners Tax Surcharge legislation and alternative payment mechanism;</para><para>These issues are of vital importance to all Australians. The time is right to examine them through a committee that Senator Lees described in a speech to the Investment and Financial Services Association last night as `among the most influential of any Senate committee'.</para><para>However, as senators will notice in the motion amended by Senator Allison, the critical issues mentioned above have been excised from the committee's terms of reference. They are completely gone. Gone is the examination of the adequacy of retirement incomes and health. Gone is the examination of the taxation of superannuation, particularly the superannuation surcharge tax. Gone is the national savings focus.</para><para>There are two new issues that the committee is being encouraged to examine in Senator 
 Allison's amended motion. They are the prudential supervision and consumer protection of superannuation, banking and financial services and the opportunities and constraints on Australia becoming a centre for global financial services. These issues are important and should be dealt with in an appropriate way. In fact, they are Labor's issues which I sought to have included in Senator Allison's original motion and which she agreed to.</para><para>Why is Senator Allison gutting her own motion by removing the references for the committee to examine the critical issues of the adequacy of health care and retirement incomes, the effectiveness and efficiency of the taxation of superannuation and the importance of developing strategies for boosting national savings? The only reason I can think of is that the government has asked Senator Allison not to include these items in her motion for reference to the committee.</para><para>I can understand that. After all, why would the government want to have the superannuation surcharge re-examined by a specialist committee which would rake over the fact that it is a policy that is considered a joke? Why would the government want a specialist committee to examine its record on national savings and to point out how it has gutted Labor's co-contribution policy which would have seen billions of dollars flow into savings and point out how it has introduced a raft of policies designed to undermine the confidence of superannuation and savings? Why would the government want a committee to examine its record on the damage it has caused to retirement incomes? The answer is that it would not want these issues examined. It has clearly made this point to Senator Allison.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

It was as insightful as ever. As I was saying, the an 
 swer is that the government does not want these issues examined. It has clearly made this point to Senator Allison who has acted accordingly by gutting her own notice of motion. We are not prepared to let that happen, hence our action in denying this motion formality. Labor is happy to support Senator Allison's original motion. That is the amendment we will seek to move to Senator Allison's amended motion. We want to see how Senator Allison and the other Democrat senators will vote on what is essentially their own motion. If they vote against it, they are sending a clear message that they will do whatever the government asks them to do.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We all heard the Treasurer say yesterday that the fairies at the bottom of the garden are in the lounge room and taking tea. This motion is absolute proof of that. We have seen the Democrats recently flip-flop around on a choice of funds. Now they are doing it with the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. We want to make it clear to the superannuation industry and the business world who may be thinking that the Australian Democrats are a serious political party that they are quite willing to try to take the applause for re-establishing the Senate committee but have baulked at the hard decisions and slip and slide around at the begging of the government. Perhaps that is what makes the Democrats so attractive to big businessâall you have to do is apply a bit of pressure and they will bend over backwards to assist the government to get its program through, no matter what the cost.</para><para>We have always indicated that we would support Senator Allison's motion, albeit we asked that the committee not be established until after 30 June this year to allow for a full and open debate on the GST package. That was always our position and still is our position. We did have a couple of issues relating to the financial services part of the committee that we wanted included and they have been.

No such reason exists for the amendments moved by Senator Allison, and this issue has done little to assist people treat the Democrats as a serious political party.

This reference to a new select committee for superannuation to reconvene in fact the previous one has been around since 6 October. I do not think any terms of reference for anything at all in this chamber has taken as many drafts, as much consultation and as much time as this one.</para></talk.start><para>Let me just go through the ways in which the Democrats have accommodated the ALP in respect of the details of the terms of reference. The ALP requested that looking into the question of Australia becoming the centre for the provision of global financial services should be addressed by this committee. We agreed, although strictly speaking that has very little to do with superannuation.</para><para>The starting date of 11 October was simply to accommodate the ALP's need for staffing this committeeâagain, we went along with it. That the chair would be appointed by the Senate is, again, another concession to the ALP. It is one which I think is quite reasonable, but it was again part of our consultation which accommodated the ALP's concerns about timing for themselves and their own staffing. The question of the enforcement of the super guarantee legislation was another important issue brought in in the last couple of weeks to accommodate people in the union movement and also the ALP. Again, it was another accommodation. </para><para>Senator Conroy also said that we have been, I think the words were, `slip-sliding' on this issue of the question of the adequacy of the tax system and related policy to address the retirement income and health care needs of Australians into the new millennium. This is 
 the term of reference which he complains about having disappeared.</para><para>The ALP over the last few weeks has agreed that we would start with those three issuesâthe prudential supervision and consumer protection for superannuation, the centre for provision of global financial services and SGC. It was always agreed between our parties that that would be the work the Senate committee would embark on initially and that it would report by the last day of sitting in June next year on those issues. They are all very substantial. They will take that amount of time. They are complex. They are difficult.</para><para>We accommodated the government, who did not want us to spell out exactly what the next round of inquiry would be about. But we do have in the terms of reference the words which make it quite clear that this Senate committee will look at superannuation and financial services issues. Senator Conroy, Senator Sherry and others in the ALP have had my commitment that, by agreement of the Senate, we will proceed down that path when these other matters are dealt with. But there are a number of superannuation bills which I would like to think this Senate committee could deal with as well.</para><para>So it is not appropriate for us at this time to be spelling out in great detail an inquiry which we will not likely get to at least until the latter part of next year and maybe not at that time either. I agree with the government. It is not appropriate for us to be providing at this early stage such detail on an inquiry which may not take place until well into the future. I would be happy if it started quickly, but the Senate can only manage so many terms of reference at any time, and I do not think this committee could deal with more than the terms of reference that are already up.</para><para>I think the ALP is just procrastinating. I think it has just offered up another opportunity to bash the Democrats, as the ALP has been so fond of doing lately. Really we are talking about semantics; we are talking about two or three words being in or out. It does not matter one way or the other. It is not to be dealt with by this committee. The terms of 
 reference in my motion make that very clear indeed. I really think it is time that the ALP simply got on with this whole questionâor perhaps it does not want this committee to be set up; perhaps it is not interested in superannuation issues at all.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>âIs there any objection to this being taken as formal?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>8669</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI want to briefly respond to aspects of Senator Conroy's remarks which I felt were particularly offensive.

Each of us had particular interests. As Senator Allison has pointed out, the terms of reference which this committee is looking at are essentially those which Labor strongly support, and some of which Labor initiated. What a joke for Senator Conroy to get up and attack the superannuation surcharge. As far as I am aware, the Labor Party now supports the superannuation surcharge. Maybe it does not; maybe we are due for another backflipâour third or fourth. In noting that the advisers are in the box, I do wish the Labor Party could get their lines straight on this. They are all over the place. I may well make a longer speech on this in due course.</para><para>Senator Conroy got up and spoke about the co-contribution. What a joke: it was not Labor's policy. Labor dropped that policy at the last election. Senator Conroy never listens to anybody, but maybe his advisers in the box will point out to him that this was not Labor Party policy. So to stand up and read this trite nonsense is pathetic.</para><para>We had negotiations over a very long period of time. I felt in the end that the various particular preferences of all parties were met. The motion, from our point of view, is not idealâthat is the truth.

 we had to reach accommodations.

That is why we have now had three senators seeking leave to discuss the substantive issue before the chair. I would be as disappointed as Senator Conroy, or my other colleagues who have 
 carriage of these sorts of issues, if I had been intimately and directly involved in negotiations and come to understandings and found that they did not stand after a little bit of arm twisting from the government.</para><para>I put seriously to the Australian Democrats that it is just simply no way to do business in this chamber.

It is an unusual circumstance; it is not the norm. It normally does not occur. I think most senators in this place would acknowledge that that is a fair comment.</para><para>It leaves us all in a very difficult situation when we face this unfortunate set of circumstances.

 in the margin, and then they are breached, unfortunately this place is simply not going to work.

The best I can do in this situation is ask: what is in the public interest? Well, superannuation affects every Australian. What I am hearing here is that the Labor Party wanted to at least consolidate, if not expand, the terms of reference of this committee to make sure that important items were not left out of the purview of the committee that is going to do the investigation and had reached an agreement with the Democrats on that matter. What I also hear is that, through negotiations with the government, the reverse has occurred: the government wants to constrict some very important matters that this inquiry might look at as far as the interests of Australians going into the next millennium are concernedâin particular, to hold off the impact of tax policy, for example, on superannuation.</para></talk.start><para>It is a simple matter for me to arbitrate as far as the public interest is concerned here. You have one side putting pressure on the Democrats and the Democrats acceding to narrow the matters that the inquiry might look at.

It might disappear into the wide blue yonder. I am not going to support that. I think the Labor Party is correct here. If I hear the amendment correctly, I will also be supporting that.

Why wouldn't you want the committee to talk about the adequacy of the tax system and related policy to address the retirement income and health care needs of Australians into the new millennium? Why wouldn't you want a committee to look at that? That is a significant public policy issue. The health care needs of the baby boomer generation are going to be hitting.

We need to know about the retirement income needs of Australians in the next 10 years.</para><para>If you wait 10 years and spend your time now pretending it is not a problem and sabotaging the retirement incomes of Austral 
 iansâlike this government has been doing for the last 3Â½ yearsâyou will not be able to respond when the time comes. Why wouldn't you want terms of reference that look at the strategies for building more effective national retirement income and long-term savings outcomes? How could you possibly want not to examine that? Senator Kemp has consistently tried to confound the establishment of this committee and demanded that the terms of reference be acceptable to the government or it will vote against it. That is what has been going on. They do not want terms of reference that look at the effective national retirement income and long-term savings outcomes.</para><para>The original terms of reference also included a reference to reforms that could be implemented following the completion of the superannuation guarantee charge phase-in to nine per cent. We all know that in this country we have a looming crisis in this area. The government abandoned the former government's co-contribution and abolished its own contribution.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âYou abandoned it, too!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âYou abandoned it and have done nothing. We got the savings rebate. Remember that, Senator Allison? It was a joke. Treasury admitted publicly, again to the humiliation of the government and of the Assistant Treasurer, that the so-called savings rebate would, in actual fact, lead to a reduction in national savings. The savings rebate saw money being taken from ordinary battling Australians and given to people who already had wealth and savings. You did not have to create any new savings to qualify for the savings rebate. All you had to do to qualify for the rebate was already have some money or savings. Not only was there no incentive for increased savings but you got the rebates by doing nothing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This parliament knows and has acknowledged consistently for 10 years that we need to look at what we are going to do after the superannuation guarantee phase-in to nine per cent is finished. Nine per cent is not enough for the majority of Australians to live on. It is acknowledged that somewhere between 15 per cent and 23 per cent of your annual 
 income needs to be put into long-term savings so that you have enough money to live on when you retire. The former government had a policy to get it up to 15 per cent. This government chose not to pursue it. It was its right to do so. I think it is bad policy, but it is its right to. We now have many hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians who will be retiring with just nine per cent and will still require access to the social security system.</para><para>The whole point when it was designed with bipartisan supportâI believe the Democrats also supported it, so there was unanimous support in the chamberâwas for the co-contributions. Senator Kemp, I know you did not have responsibility in this area, but leading into 1996 the government said, `We will keep that, but we choose to vary the means of delivery.' Four billion dollars worth of tax cuts would have been put into people's long-term retirement incomes that you said in your 1996 election platform you would support. Then, like a number of other core commitments, it suddenly became non-core. This government abandoned it. That was the first part of the destruction of people's retirement incomes. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of retirement income were tossed out by this government so that they could give money to people who already had money.</para><para>Even the government became embarrassed by the savings rebate. Last year when the ANTS package came, what happened to the savings rebate that was there to fix this problem? They abandoned it. They knew the savings rebate was a dog. They knew it would lead to lower national savings and yet they did not care. They cared about looking after their mates. Like in the Ralph package yesterday, where again they have not addressed this issue, they are giving money to their mates. We are seeing huge gains for the people on higher incomes.</para><para>I noted that in question time today Senator Murray even had a question for Senator Kemp on this issue. He said that 70 per cent of capital gains at the moment go to the top 20 per cent. He did not mind voting for a tax package a few months before which saw 50 per cent of the gains from the ANTS package 
 going to the top 20 per cent. They shaved $1 billion off it. All of a sudden, he has a conscience about the 70 per cent of capital gains revenue that will be given away to the top 20 per cent. No doubt if he is able to knock a couple of hundred million dollars off that, he will be voting to give the top 20 per cent all the big benefits in the business tax reform package as well.</para><para>Many good things are in the business tax reform package, as the shadow Treasurer has said. If this government was actually prepared to talk to the Labor Party rather than just being insulting and abusive as the Treasurer was yesterday, it might be able to get a decent bipartisan package. The Treasurer might be prepared to do so. You can sit there on the other side of the chamber and say, `What did he call you?' Then, when it is pointed out that all the Treasurer was doing is abusing us, the Assistant Treasurer just laughs. He wants it both ways in this debate.</para><para>But what is wrong with having a look at the taxation superannuation, particularly in light of the Ralph report? What is wrong with looking at the taxation of superannuation, particularly the superannuation high income earners tax surcharge legislation and alternative payment mechanisms? Why don't the government want to look at that and, more importantly, Senator Allison, why don't the Democrats?</para><para>What we are moving today may seem very familiar to you because it was originally listed as `Notice given on 9 March 1999, 136, Senator Allison: to move'. This is your original motion. You have let the government bully you and force you into abandoning your own position, and you have caved in to Senator Kemp and Treasury. That is what has happened. Caving in to Senator Kemp! It is almost too frightening for words. Wait until they turn up the pressure and wheel out Senator Alston and Senator Hill on you again, and wait until the Treasurer and the Prime Minister start on you on Ralph. You have caved in on something that is simple and fundamental to this chamber and, if the government are not prepared to support a terms of reference for a select committee, you 
 say, `Well, we will not do it; we will give them what they want.'</para><para>How on earth can opposition parties stand back and not say anything when we reach a deal with youâwhen we think we have an agreement? We have taken responsibility for the fact that two weeks ago you stood up and sought to move the original motion and, due to confusion on our side, it was denied formality. Within two weeks and after a couple of phone calls from Senator Kemp and his office, you have caved in. What sort of serious political party do you try to portray yourselves as? A bit of pressure from Senator Kemp! I would not mind if it was from Senator Alston. I would not mind if at least a few of the heavyweights had been brought in to put the weights on youâthen, at least, it would have been, `Well, you know, we were called in.' I would not have minded if it had been Senator Hill or Senator Alstonâone of the bovver boys from over there. I know Senator Alston has called you a lot of names over the years in the chamber. I would not have minded himâbut Senator Kemp! It is an insult to all Democrat members. It is an insult to Senator Brown, who was party to the agreement, and it is an insult to Senator Bartlett that you caved in to Senator Kemp.</para><para>The substantive issue that we are debating in these amendments, which are now circulating, is what is wrong with those issues. I am looking forward to your contribution. Do not just stand up and say that the government did not like them. Stand up and argue why you do not want to look at retirement incomes and health care needs, why you do not want to look at the national retirement income and long-term savings outcomes, why you do not want to look at what we should do after the nine per cent phase in has finished, and why you do not want to look at the taxation surcharge. I know why Senator Kemp does not want to talk about the surcharge. It is called a tax, for a start. It represented the big lie in their first budget and it represented dishonesty to Australian people when the government said that they would not put in any new taxes. They called it something else fancy and then they turned around and put in a surcharge, and it has been a disaster. They 
 have not been able to get as much money from it as they projected and it has caused enormous cost to ordinary, battling superannuation earners. But Senator Kemp is forever trying to pretend that it is a great measure.</para><para>Why don't we look at another mechanism?

I was amenable to the wider terms of reference of the inquiry but, apparently, due to government pressure, Senator Allison and the Democrats have taken these key issues of the retirement income and health care needs of Australians off the agenda of that inquiry. We have two questions to ask there. The first is: why don't these matters relate to the other terms of reference of the inquiry into the superannuation welfare of Australians? The second is: why did the Democrats agree to government pressure to narrow the terms of reference of the inquiry when they did not have to? The mathematics of the Senate is such that, had the Democrats proceeded, they had both the Australian Greens' support and the Labor Party's support, and therefore they had the numbers in the Senate to ensure that their original terms of reference got through. They did not have to bow to the dictates of the government.</para></talk.start><para>As a political party that has always supported transparency in the public interest, we need to hear much more from Senator Allison about the negotiations that took place between the government and the Democrats. Every Australian is aware that there is a new configuration of power in this place. But when you see an important issue like this being altered when it does not need to beâin other words, the Democrats are doing this as a favour to the government because, had they stood their ground, they would have prevailed and the inquiry would have proceeded as originally put forward by themâyou have to ask: what is the quid pro quo? What are the other factors that have been brought in to the discussions with the government? The public has a right to know this.</para><para>Otherwise, and I say this to the Democrat members present, the public will begin to gain the impression that the Democrats not only are moving closer to the government but also are in a working relationship with the government for mutual advantage which is not in the public interest. Changing these terms of reference is not in the public interestâit is in the government's interest but it is not in the public interest. We have the Democrats unnecessarily working against the public interest by narrowing these terms of reference.</para><para>Senator Allison may not even know what is being traded here. It may be that other members of the Democrats such as the Leader of the Australian Democrats or senior staffers are negotiating with the government on a range of other matters and have agreed, for the convenience of the government, to accede to narrowing the terms of reference of this inquiry. We need to knowâthe Senate ought to be putting pressure on the Democrats now and that is what I am doing hereâwhat those other matters are. What is going on behind closed doors in the mutual self-interest of the Democrats and the government against the wider interests of the public of Australia?</para><para>The Democrats have been sticklers for transparency in government. What has happened here is they are now becoming part of the government. So they have to be consistent and transparent about this when they are affecting government outcomes. This is a 
 government outcome that we are dealing with here.</para><para>I say to Senator Allison, because I know she is going to follow me in this debate, that a lot of people will be listening carefully to what she says in answer to this question: what are the other issues that have come into play to break an agreement that the majority of the Senate had arrived at and to unnecessarily narrow the terms of reference of this inquiry because the government wanted it? You just do not do that off the cuff; you just do not do that to be nice because the public interest is here. Something else is being traded. The Senate has a rightâbecause the public has a rightâto know what that something else is.</para><para>I say to Senator Allison: be straight with us; tell us what the other matters are and tell us what the other advantage to the public is that the Democrats see in agreeing with this arrangement unnecessarily with the government. Then both the public and I can understand. Only thenâif necessary and if it is important enoughâwould I change my voting intention here, which is to vote with the opposition. There is the challenge: it is not to simply get up and say, `We have an arrangement with the government and we have agreed to change an agreement made with the rest of the Senate'; the challenge is to get up and say what is being traded here.

 able number; Senator Brown who has moved in his place his own terms of reference to the environment references committee which I chair and who has never even bothered to consult me about this matter individually. For Senator Brown to come into this place and complain about breaches of agreement and lack of consultation, openness and transparency is the height of hypocrisy, and I could not believe I was hearing it.</para><para>Let us just look at exactly what we are talking about here so that we see the absurdity of the ALP proceeding down this path. We are talking about terms of reference which have changed very slightly in their wording. I am going to go through those terms because those people who are listening to this debate would have no idea. They would imagine that the Democrats have agreed to some amazing arrangement with the government that is beyond the scope of this place or beyond anything the ALP might have imagined, so let me just go through the wording. The ALP amendments state:</para><para>The committee inquire into matters pertaining to superannuation and financial services referred to it by the Senate and inquire initially into . . . </para><para>Then there are three matters: prudential supervision and consumer protection for superannuation, banking and financial services; opportunities and constraints for Australia to become a centre for the provision of global financial services; and enforcement of the superannuation guarantee charge. At every point in the discussions over these terms of reference, the ALP has agreed that this committee will look at those three matters initially and that it will report back in June next year.</para><para>Senator Conroy and Senator Faulkner talk about breaches of agreement. This was always the agreement, such as it was, in terms of consultation and drafts going from one office to the other trying to reach some agreement, some accommodation, on this issue. It was always understood that those would be the matters this inquiry would look into initially. The adequacy of the tax system and related policy to address retirement incomes et cetera are fine things for the Senate to look into, and have my support, but we always agreed not to deal with those matters until we had dealt 
 with these other matters. I am quite happy to entertain terms of reference which go to the wording of the ALP, but we all agreed that this was not the right time to do that.</para><para>It has been fairly obvious to me since coming into the Senate three years ago that the best outcomes from the work of the committees in this place come from reaching consensus, reaching accommodation, with each of the parties in this place. That is what I have attempted to do for the last seven monthsâsince 6 March this year. Senator Conroy says there has been no discussion with his office. That simply is not true. The emails just in the last week between my office and his and between my office and Senator Kemp's office are almost too numerous to count. So for Senator Conroy to now have the gall to stand up here in this place and say that the Democrats have breached some agreement is an outrage and an absolute fabrication of the truth. Senator Conroy would happily have the Democrats and the ALP agree to something with which the government did not agree and proceed down that pathâhe would be very happy to do that. But to reach accommodation is apparently out of the question for the ALP and the opposition. I do not operate that way.</para><para>If there is a possibility on a committee such as this of us reaching agreement then I will seek to do that because I think that you have the best kind of cooperation in, and the best outcome from, committee inquiry processes if all parties are happy with what they are doing. In the case of setting up this committee, it seemed to me to be a very opportune thing to proceed down that path and to reach agreement. Down the track, once we have finished these inquiriesâthat is entirely up to the ALP and ourselves, and possibly it will not include the government; I do not know about thatâit is entirely up to the Senate to determine when we move to the next stage of the inquiry. I am happy with that; the Democrats have said all along that is what they are interested in. But it is a question of staging, of timing. This committee cannot take on board broad terms of reference that go into so many different areas. These three matters will occupy the time of the committee very substantially between now and then.</para><para>It is all very well for Senator Brown to stand up and say, `The committee should do it all,' but he does not have to be on these committees. He does not turn up to these committee hearings. He is not part of the process. I really think he should mind his own business because, quite frankly, these three matters that are before us today, that are part of these terms of reference, will occupy a great deal of the time of this committee. They are very substantial and do not need to be added to by the further broad terms of reference that Senator Conroy has proposed in the amendments he has moved. It is totally disingenuous for him to stand up and say we are now rejecting something which was agreed previously and that we are somehow caving in to what the government wants us to do.</para><para>I am really disappointed in this whole debate, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have proceeded on good faith. I have attempted to reach consensus and an accommodation with the parties involved. Clearly the ALP simply see this as an opportunity for them to stand up and bash the Democrats yet again. Senator Conroy brings into the debate the question of the GST. I ask him: what has that got to do with this particular debate? Again, this is nothing to do with the real matters: what is appropriate for this committee to deal with and what sort of staging we should adopt to get sensible reporting out of this committee when it has looked at very important issues. This is about the ALP again taking the opportunity to attack the Democrats. I for one am very disappointed because I worked with the previous superannuation committee and found it to be one whose members could cooperate across political parties. It was, in my view, a very effective committee. But clearly Senator Conroy does not want that in the future. He sees this as an opportunity for political point scoring. Quite frankly, I am disappointed with that. I have, as a result, some fairly low expectations of what this committee will be able to do if that is the attitude which prevails. If it is not, fineâwe will proceed to do some good work. But if Senator Conroy proceeds with this kind of political point scoring there is not much to be gained by that committee. </para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendments (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Conroy's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy PresidentâSenator S.

The Base is a joint user airfield, supporting both military and civil aircraft operations.</para><para>RAAF Base Townsville was developed during the Second World War and many of the existing facilities have been only slightly modified since this period. The Base forms part of a chain of military airfields across northern Australia to Learmonth in the west. It provides for the air defence of northern Queensland and its approaches. The Base's primary function is as a deployment base for combat aircraft during a contingency and as an air head for the 3rd Brigade's Ready Deployment Force. 
</para><para>The proposal examined by the Committee aims to provide new operational facilities and upgrade or replace current Base facilities, including:</para><para>.	 a purpose built Ordnance Loading Apron complex;</para><para>.	 a Quick Reaction Alert Facility;</para><para>.	 a dedicated Fighter/Strike Operational and Technical Support Facility;</para><para>.	 light tactical aircraft facilities;</para><para>.	 consolidated vehicle and battery maintenance facility; and</para><para>.	 replacement of existing perimeter road with a sealed all-weather surface.</para><para>An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the redevelopment has been undertaken. The findings of the EIA have led to a determination that there will be no significant environmental impact resulting from the proposed Redevelopment Stage 1. Concurrent with the EIA process, substantial consultation was undertaken with special interest groups and environmental agencies to assist in determining the environmental issues associated with the proposed project. An Environmental Management Plan for the Stage 1 Redevelopment construction activities is to be developed and approved before construction commences.</para><para>The Committee is satisfied that the Department of Defence appears to have undertaken sufficient consultation with the relevant authorities and interest groups in the consideration of environmental and heritage issues associated with the redevelopment.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated cost of the project was $95 million. However, the approved budget figure is $87.05 million. Defence indicated to the Committee that attempts will be made to make some savings throughout the project, allowing funding of the full scope of the works outlined in the proposal. However, budgetary restraints may result in some lower priority elements of the project being moved to a subsequent stage.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Redevelopment of Darwin Naval Base Project</inline></para><para>The second report I have just tabled, the Committee's seventh of 1999, relates to the redevelopment of Darwin Naval Base.</para><para>For this inquiry, the Committee inspected existing facilities and sites for the proposed works. The Committee also held a public hearing into the proposal in Darwin on 6 July 1999 and received a number of written submissions.</para><para>Darwin Naval Base is located within Larrakeyah Barracks two kilometres from the Darwin Central Business District and was constructed between 
 1980 and 1982 at a cost of $17.7 million. The Base provides support for vessels undertaking patrol activities, the Commander Northern Command, major fleet units, submarines and visiting warships from foreign navies exercising or operating in northern Australian waters.</para><para>The operational tempo in Australia's north has increased significantly over the past few years. Defence has advised the Committee that the proposed facilities are necessary to overcome existing occupational health and safety (OH&amp;S) issues and operational deficiencies.</para><para>The proposal examined by the Committee involves the:</para><para>.	 construction of a new 146 metre wharf to accommodate up to nine patrol boats;</para><para>.	 improvement and extension of the existing wharf;</para><para>.	 realignment of the boat ramp to be parallel with the existing wharf;</para><para>.	 construction of three new hardstands;</para><para>.	 provision of an additional fuel storage and reconditioning facility;</para><para>.	 provision of an under cover naval stores receipt and dispatch area; and</para><para>.	 relocation of 36 Water Transport Troop to the main Base complex.</para><para>The proposal will relocate approximately 130 personnel and 120 dependents to Darwin, but the total number of Navy personnel will remain basically the same, due to the effects of the Defence Reform Program.</para><para>The development provides an opportunity for locally-based businesses to benefit through contracting, sub-contracting and the supply of goods and services. Increased expenditure in the Territory is expected through provisioning and maintenance contracts for the additional ships. It is anticipated that the redevelopment will result in greater opportunities for companies supporting patrol boat maintenance in Darwin.</para><para>The Committee is satisfied that the Department of Defence has adequately addressed environmental and heritage concerns.  Defence has completed a flora, fauna and aquatic survey of the area and forwarded the resulting report to Environment Australia and the Northern Territory Department of Lands, Planning and Environment. Both authorities have agreed to the project proceeding. An issues identification study will also be used as a basis for detailed consultation. Factors to alleviate community concerns will be built into Defence's plans for the project, for example, relevant concerns will be incorporated into the project environmental management plans.</para><para>Concern was expressed by local residents that the works may result in an increase in the flow of 
 traffic, particularly heavy vehicles on local roads. The Committee has recommended that in order to alleviate excessive traffic noise related to the operations of the Base, the Department of Defence should continue to consult with Darwin City Council and local residents. This should include consideration of existing guidelines governing the level of noise permitted from construction activities, particularly those carried out outside normal working hours and on weekends.</para><para>The Committee also heard safety concerns from local residents that the project may result in an increase in the transportation of weapons along residential roads. The Committee was satisfied that the movement of ordnance is not an environmental or safety risk due to the limited quantities transported, the nature of the ordnance being transported and Defence's compliance with transportation rules and regulations.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated cost of the project was $12.4 million.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the reports to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>8682</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt question time today, Senator Newman was criticised by the opposition about the government's non-activity in defence matters and the fact that not enough money was being spent on defence. I think these two reports put the lie to that. These reports put forward two proposals amounting to almost $100 million. One of them is the RAAF Base Townsville. Part of the activity there and money being spent there is on the development of the Air Force base which, as everybody who is interested in the matter would know, particularly Senator Ian Macdonald, is an airhead for the 3rd Brigade's ready deployment force, which of course is in East Timor at the moment. It just shows that the government is supporting the 3rd Brigade. The other relates to the Darwin naval base redevelopment, as Senator Patterson would know, and approves facilities to enable more patrol boats to be stationed in Darwin to carry out patrol work to avert the further incursion of illegal immigrants and others into Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Statements</type><page.no>8682</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>8682</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to incorporate a ministerial statement on

</para><para>.	 informed the wider community of the preparedness of key sectors.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government has been actively monitoring progress towards Year 2000 compliance of over 3 500 business critical systems across 124 Departments and agencies, and has released results publicly since December 1998. The level of detail in these reports places Australia at the forefront of public reporting by governments around the world.</para><para>I am pleased to announce that according to the most recent public report released today, as at August this year, 97 per cent of the business-critical systems identified in Commonwealth agencies had been fixed. All the available evidence suggests that the community can have confidence that key Commonwealth Government services will be able to be delivered seamlessly into the year 2000.</para><para>The Government will now receive monthly reports on the small number of outstanding systems until all work is complete. Less than 1 per cent of systems (or 21 systems) are likely to be non-compliant by the end of this month. The majority do not have a role in the delivery of key services. Half of them relate to building systems.</para><para>The Government also monitors the progress of 51 government business entities (GBEs). These include Telstra, Australia Post and the Sydney Airport Corporation. At August 1999, Commonwealth GBEs reported they had achieved average compliance levels of 93 per cent. Full compliance for all GBEs is scheduled for end October 1999.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government's remediation work is substantially complete. Agencies are required to develop contingency plans aimed at delivering services as usual in the event of any unforseen problemsâwhether Year 2000-related or not. This latest report shows 78 per cent of contingency planning is now complete.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government is responsible for the delivery, or regulating the delivery, of three key national infrastructure sectorsâbanking and finance, aviation and communications.

Australia's banks and other financial institutions have completed the vast majority of remediation and testing of all critical systems. This should ensure that it will be `business as usual' in the financial sector.</para><para>Institutions are also finalising their contingency plans to deal with unexpected problems or prob 
 lems outside of their control. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is continuing to closely monitor the Year 2000 preparations of financial institutions.</para><para>A comprehensive program to test the Year 2000 readiness of the Australian payments system was successfully completed by 30 June 1999. No Year 2000 problems were reported by test participants and payments mechanisms, such as ATMs, EFTPOS and credit cards, are Year 2000 ready. Contingency plans for the payments system are also nearing completion.</para><para>The public can be reassured that their deposits are safe and that their records are not at risk from Year 2000 related problems. There is no need for people to withdraw more money over the New Year period than they normally would for a long weekend.

More than 90 percent of remediation work on critical network and IT systems has been completed by these carriers, with full remediation of critical systems scheduled for October 1999 or earlier. Their current focus is on contingency planning. In general, the smaller carriers and carriage service providers report that they are also well advanced in their Year 2000 preparations.</para><para>The Government, through the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), will be continuing to monitor further developments closely.</para><para>In August 1999 the industry body, the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF) reported that telecommunications carriers and service providers had successfully completed a range of cross-network service continuity tests for the Year 2000.

Since 1996 the Commonwealth has:</para><para>.	 provided leadership in preparing and reporting on the Government's own systems for the Year 2000;</para><para>.	 through its various regulatory bodies, overseen the Year 2000 preparations in the sectors for which it is responsible, in particular banking and finance, aviation and communications;</para><para>.	 raised awareness of the need for business to be prepared, with a particular focus on small-to-medium sized enterprises;</para><para>.	 provided appropriate legislative and taxation support for business efforts; and</para><para>.	 informed the wider community of the state of preparedness of key sectors.</para><para>Similarly, the State and Territory Governments have:  
</para><para>.	 remediated and reported on their own systems in preparation for the Year 2000 issue;</para><para>.	 overseen the preparations of key infrastructure and services for which they are responsibleâsuch as the energy, transport, health, water and sewerage, and emergency services sectors, including through cooperative arrangements with the private sector;</para><para>.	 worked with the Commonwealth to raise industry awareness of the Year 2000 issue;</para><para>.	 supported the Commonwealth by passing complementary information disclosure legislation where necessary; and</para><para>.	 complemented national awareness messages for the community with local information.</para><para>In relation to listed Australian companies, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has required a series of disclosures regarding Year 2000 preparedness.</para><para>In addition to these formal frameworks for awareness raising, cooperation and reporting, a stocktake commissioned by governments of national activities to address Year 2000 issues found that a range of supplementary informal mechanisms exist in addition to formal monitoring. These include:</para><para>.	 functional area forums set up by State governments for sectors such as health and emergency services, promoting information exchange in areas of common interest;</para><para>.	 industry working groups to ensure that key areas of common interest are addressed effectively, such as the Interbank Working Group (IWG) and the Aviation Year 2000 Committee;</para><para>.	 issue-driven working groups, for example health sector groups addressing business continuity planning and prescription drug logistics management; and</para><para>.	 bilateral contacts such as those between the major food retailers and their suppliers, or transport and logistic companies and the owner drivers who work for them.</para><para>In addition, the stocktake identified widespread use of the Internet, public and private seminars and conferences, published material, information packs and helplines to raise awareness of Year 2000 issues and how they are being addressed. A copy of the stocktake, undertaken by Admiral Management Services, can be found at www.year2000.gov.au.</para><para>A key national forum for addressing the Year 2000 issue is the Year 2000 National Steering Committee (NSC). The Government established the NSC in 1997 under the chairmanship of Mr Maurice Newman AM, with funding of nearly $10 million. The NSC comprises members of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, and local government and industry associations, and was charged with developing and implementing a national 
 awareness raising strategy to encourage business and industry to prepare for the Year 2000. The NSC has targeted its messages particularly at small and medium enterprises.</para><para>Major NSC initiatives include national television, radio and print advertising campaigns, a national telephone hotline (1800 11 2000), seminars and workshops, and a round of national infrastructure forums. The forums focused on providing a platform for business to brief industry and the community on their Year 2000 readiness, and to engender a spirit of cooperation. The very high levels of awareness of the Year 2000 issue demonstrated in surveys of Australian business must significantly reflect the outstanding efforts of Mr Newman and his committee.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PREPAREDNESS</inline></para><para>The level of detail of reporting on public sector Year 2000 progress in Australia has placed this country at the forefront of public reporting by governments around the world.</para><para>Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments are all working towards the common goal of maintaining business as usual for the delivery of key services in 2000, and all are developing contingency plans to cope with any unexpected problems that may arise. Each jurisdiction has developed an approach to addressing and reporting on Year 2000 progress that best serves its particular circumstances and requirements.</para><para>Governments around Australia are also working cooperatively. Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for Year 2000 issues have met on a number of occasions to exchange information and to support the development of a national approach to Year 2000 issues. Year 2000 Project Directors from Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments meet more regularly to support this process.</para><para>Australian governments are now entering the final phases of their Year 2000 projects and are on target to have them completed ahead of the critical date change period. This means that the Commonwealth, States and Territories are well on track to deliver services normally on and beyond 1 January 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT REPORTING</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government has been actively monitoring the progress towards Year 2000 compliance of over 3 500 business critical systems across 124 budget dependant Departments and agencies. Agencies include, for example, Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</para><para>The Government has compiled quarterly reports on the Year 2000 readiness of portfolios since 1997, and released results publicly since December 1998. Public reports are now being issued at agency level, 
 placing the Commonwealth at the forefront of public sector reporting.</para><para>The most recent Commonwealth report released today (22 September 1999) reveals that as at August this year, 97 per cent of the business-critical systems identified in Commonwealth agencies are now fixed. This means they are either fully compliant, or have been remediated and brought back into service, awaiting the executive sign-off necessary to achieve full compliance. All the available evidence suggests that the community can have confidence that key Commonwealth Government services will be able to be delivered seamlessly into the year 2000.</para><para>The Government will now receive monthly reports on the small number of outstanding systems across all agencies until all work is complete.</para><para>The Government also monitors the progress of 51 government business entities (GBEs). These include Telstra, Australia Post and the Sydney Airport Corporation. As at August 1999, Commonwealth GBEs report that they have achieved average compliance levels of 93 per cent. Full compliance for all GBEs is scheduled for end October 1999.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government's remediation work is substantially complete. However, like any other organisations, Government agencies are dependent on supply chains, distribution systems and basic infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunications to operate normally. Even though no major disruptions to key national infrastructure services are expected, agencies are required to develop contingency plans aimed at delivering services as usual in the event of any unforseen problemsâwhether they be Year 2000 related or not.

In those exceptional cases where testing is yet to be completed, the industry regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is satisfied that there are adequate fallback arrangements in place to ensure that it will be business as usual.</para><para>Banks have almost completed their contingency plans to deal with unexpected problems or problems outside their control. Similarly, other financial institutions (namely, building societies, credit unions, life and general insurance companies, superannuation funds and friendly societies) have also completed the vast majority of remediation and testing of critical systems, and are now well into the contingency planning phase.</para><para>A comprehensive program to test the Year 2000 readiness of the Australian payments system was successfully completed, on time, by 30 June 1999. No Year 2000 issues were reported by test participants.</para><para>APRA is continuing to closely monitor the Year 2000 preparations of financial institutions. It is now focusing its attention on the development and implementation of contingency plans by regulated entities. Planning is now well underway, with contingency plans for all clearing arrangements scheduled to be ready by end-September 1999.</para><para>The public can be assured that electronic payments mechanisms, such as ATMs, EFTPOS and credit cards, are already, and will continue to be, Year 2000 ready.</para><para>The public can also be assured that their deposits are safe and that their records are not at risk from Year 2000 related issues. As such, there is no need for people to withdraw more money over the New Year period than they normally would for a long weekend.</para><para>However, if they wish to do so, the Reserve Bank has built up ample stocks of currency notes to meet that demand.

Both operate international and domestic flights and have regional airline subsidiaries or affiliate partnerships. Major airports in Australia are owned by the private sector, with the exception of airports in the Sydney Basin, which remain in Commonwealth ownership. The 
 Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is the statutory authority responsible for aviation safety. Airservices Australia (ASA), a Government-owned commercial authority, is responsible for  air traffic management.</para><para>Since July 1998 the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DoTRS) has chaired a Year 2000 Aviation Committee which meets monthly to monitor and report to Government on the preparedness of the various sectors in the aviation industry. The Committee consists of representatives from the Commonwealth Government, the aviation industry and consumers of aviation services and reports on a regular basis to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.</para><para>ASA has been working since 1996 to ensure its services are maintained normally during the Year 2000 transition. ASA has advised that the majority of its internal systems are Year 2000 ready. ASA is confident that there will be no disruption to the services it provides to the aviation industry as a result of the impact of the Year 2000 issues on its own systems. To the extent that ASA relies on others, it has determined they are compliant and, where appropriate, has developed extensive contingency plans.</para><para>The Department of Defence is undertaking a comprehensive remediation program to ensure that all relevant military aviation systems are Year 2000 compliant before 1 January 2000. Already 100 per cent of critical systems and airfield technical equipment are certified as Year 2000 compliant.</para><para>CASA has called on all licensed air operators, aviation maintenance organisations and licensed aerodromes to provide it with information on their Year 2000 readiness and contingency planning by 30 September 1999. To assist this, CASA has sent a comprehensive <inline font-style="italic">Operator's Guide to Y2K Readiness and Contingency Planning</inline>  to all licence holders.</para><para>Major Australian airports have advised that they are progressing well towards full compliance and have programs in place to ensure business continuity during the Year 2000 period. As part of its Year 2000 Project, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has conducted site visits to 70 major international airports worldwide, including Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.</para><para>The Australian Airports Association has been working closely with other airport operators, particularly those in regional Australia, to ensure they are aware of Year 2000 issues, and to provide advice and guidance on compliance issues.</para><para>Qantas and Ansett, and their subsidiaries and country regional alliance partners, have been working on the Year 2000 issue for a number of years.</para><para>The airlines are significant contributors to industry initiatives on addressing the millennium bug. The 
 manufacturers of aircraft used by Qantas and Ansett (Boeing, Airbus Industrie and Bombardier) have advised the industry there are no safety or airworthiness issues relating to the Year 2000 compliance of their aircraft.</para><para>Through its membership of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and APEC, its contacts with other countries on a bilateral basis, and international assistance projects, Australia has taken a leading role internationally in raising awareness of the Year 2000 issue and its implications for aviation. ICAO has developed regional contingency plans, and the Asia Pacific regional contingency plan, which will be used to manage air services during the transition period, was approved by the ICAO President in August 1999. Airservices Australia had an active involvement in the development and finalisation of this plan.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Communications</inline></para><para>Given the dependence of contemporary society on telecommunications it is imperative that this sector is Year 2000 ready.</para><para>The Australian telecommunications industry includes around 50 major service providers, including some 30 carriers, and around 800 Internet service providers. Together they use wire, cable, radio and information technologies to provide a vast range and number of telecommunications services from simple telephony to sophisticated broadband services.</para><para>The industry regulator, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA), has a significant role in relation to technical regulation and consumer protection. Together with the industry body the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF), both have played a key role in coordinating Year 2000 preparations in an industry highly dependent on network linkages.</para><para>In recent reporting to Government, the four major carriers (Telstra, Cable and Wireless Optus, Vodafone and AAPT) have indicated that their Year 2000 preparations are well advanced. More than 90 percent of remediation work on critical network and IT systems has been completed by these carriers, with full remediation of critical systems scheduled for October or earlier. Their current focus is now on contingency planning. The four major carriers anticipate that by the end of June 2000 their expenditure on Year 2000 preparations and remediation will be in the vicinity of $540 million.</para><para>In general, the smaller carriers and carriage service providers report that they are also well advanced in their Year 2000 preparations. Many are advantaged by their comparatively recent entry into the market. Their equipment is already compliant, and they also rely on the services of the major carriers.</para><para>The Government, through the ACA, will be continuing to monitor further developments closely. 
</para><para>In August 1999, ACIF reported that telecommunications carriers and service providers had successfully completed a range of cross-network service continuity tests for the Year 2000. The three-month test program involved a range of carriers and various call types. Successful call connections were made across different carrier networks from fixed-line services to mobile services, fixed-line services to fixed-line services, mobile services to mobile services, and mobile services to fixed-line services. The tests confirmed that dates do not pass between networks, which greatly limits potential for Year 2000 impacts in the highly interdependent cross networks. With the cross-network testing program complete, ACIF is increasing its focus on intercarrier and industry contingency planning activities.</para><para>The major Australian carriers are conducting interconnectivity testing with international carriers through the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other carrier specific international relationships.</para><para>Telstra is playing a key leadership role in supporting the regional Year 2000 initiatives of the ITU.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Emergency 000</inline></para><para>Telstra has reported that it completed its program of evaluation and testing of individual elements of the 000 emergency service in 1998.

Preliminary survey results released on 31 August 1999 confirm that Australian business has made considerable progress in dealing with the Year 2000 issue. 35 per cent of businesses surveyed report that they had completed their preparations. Encouragingly, virtually all businesses who haven't already completed their Year 2000 work report that they expect to be completed by December 1999.</para><para>The survey reinforced the electricity, gas and water supply sectors as those where the highest proportion of businesses were undertaking, or had completed, Year 2000 work. The finance and insurance industry reported the highest rate of completion of Year 2000 work and testing. 
</para><para>The proportion of businesses not intending to undertake work has remained constant at around 40 per cent. Nearly 80 per cent of these are micro businesses with less than 20 employees, and low levels of technology dependence. They are found across all industry sectors. The majority of businesses not intending to undertake any Year 2000 work reported that they either don't have any technology that will be affected, or they don't believe their businesses will be affected. The proportion and general characteristics of business not undertaking Year 2000 work in Australia is broadly consistent with experiences in the US and other well prepared countries.</para><para>The survey suggested, however, that there is no room for complacency, with many businesses identifying the need to complete contingency planning in the remaining months ahead.</para><para>Based on the latest data, the ABS has revised downwards its estimate of the costs to Australian business of addressing the Year 2000 issue to around $10 billion. When public sector remediation costs are added, total estimated expenditure in Australia on Year 2000 is around $12 billion.</para><para>As more information becomes available on the preparedness of individual organisations, business and governments will be better placed to make informed decisions about the level of contingency planning required.

Local Government was added in April 1999.</para><para>The reporting by States and Territory Governments together with that of private utility and infrastructure providers combine to provide the following picture on local key services and utilities.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Electricity</inline></para><para>A reliable supply of electricity is fundamental to the maintenance of normal business and community services. The electricity industry in Australia is organised according to four regions: Tasmania; Western Australia; Northern Territory; and the National Electricity Market, which supplies the Eastern Seaboard (covering all other States/Territories). Single, vertically integrated companies supply both Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In Tasmania the industry is divided into three companies: one each for generation, transmission and retail.</para><para>On the Eastern Seaboard the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO) manages the wholesale market for the supply and purchase of electricity. Participants in the Eastern Seaboard market include generators, distributors, retailers and wholesale customers.</para><para>Information on the Year 2000 readiness of all organisations involved in the delivery of electricity is contained in State and Territory Government Year 2000 reports, except in Queensland where 
 reports on private sector participants are published by the Queensland Electricity Supply Industry (QESI) Year 2000 committee.</para><para>The two peak electricity industry bodiesâNEMMCO and the Electricity Supply Association of Australia (ESAA)âhave established a number of forums on Year 2000 issues to facilitate information sharing, cooperative approaches to issues and coordination of activities.</para><para>The industry as a whole has reported it has nearly completed analysis, assessment, and testing of business critical systems, and is well advanced in contingency planning. The industry advises that extensive testing to date has not revealed any problems associated with Year 2000 that would affect current supply reliability. Remediation activities have reached the 90 per cent mark and are scheduled for completion by September 1999. State and Territory Governments report that contingency plans are increasingly in place and complete in some jurisdictions.</para><para>Contingency planning in the electricity industry is normal practice. The industry already has in place extensive contingency plans to deal with disruptions to electricity supply that can occur at any time through events such as storms, unplanned outages at power stations and damage to power poles and lines. NEMMCO chairs an industry group that examines contingency planning, including for the Year 2000. Those plans are being reviewed in light of the Year 2000 issue.</para><para>States such as Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory are used to dealing with electricity outages during the summer months, which are cyclone and storm seasons. In these areas end users who have a reliance on electricity generally have alternative arrangements in place (e.g. diesel powered generators) should the service fail. Similarly, those organisations with greatest dependency on electricity generally have contingency plans in place to continue operations over the short term.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Water and sewerage</inline></para><para>Local water authorities are responsible for the collection and distribution of water and the environmentally safe collection, treatment and disposal of sewage. The water sector is owned and operated by State, Territory and Local Governments, except in South Australia where it is supplied by a government-owned and private sector operated entity. The number of entities varies by State and region.</para><para>State and Territory Government Year 2000 reports indicate that the Year 2000 readiness of water supply across the majority of States and Territories is above 90 per cent, and contingency plans range from 75 to 100 per cent complete  Information on the readiness of water supply in some areas of Queensland is not yet complete. Some jurisdictions, 
 for example Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania report a heavy reliance on gravity fed water systems that make little or no use of date dependent technology.</para><para>Disruptions to water supply, such as a burst pipe, can occur without warning. As with the electricity sector, contingency planning is part of normal business planning for water suppliers, but they report that they are also developing additional contingency plans to cope with any unexpected problems arising from Year 2000.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Gas</inline></para><para>In Australia gas is supplied primarily by the private sector. Western Australia is the exception, where gas is distributed by the State-owned AlintaGas corporation. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory the gas sector is almost entirely owned and operated by the Australian Gas Light Corporation (AGL). In all other States and Territories there are a number of large and small organisations involved in the supply, distribution, transmission, retail and wholesale of gas. In the Northern Territory, 99 per cent of gas is used in electricity generation, and 95 per cent of electricity is generated by gas. Tasmania does not currently have natural gas. The main activity of the Gas Corporation of Tasmania is the supply of bulk LPG to thousands of consumers throughout the state.</para><para>In Western Australia the major gas producers, users and pipeline owners have formed a Gas Industry Group to facilitate industry exchange and cooperation on Year 2000 issues. A similar group has been formed in South Australia, which includes representatives from Western Australia and Queensland.</para><para>While gas has wide domestic use, especially for heating systems, the Year 2000 critical date period is considered to be a low usage period in Australia as it will be summer. For industry also it will be a low usage or close down period of the year. Gas is also used to power electricity generators. In the main, gas fired generators are used to manage peak demand. In the Northern Territory, however, its five major electricity power stations are powered by gas.</para><para>Most gas companies in Australia report their Year 2000 status through the ASX, and in one case to the New York Stock Exchange. A number of States report on the preparedness of the gas sector as part of their reporting framework. Victoria has brought the entire sectorâgas distribution, retail and transmissionâinto its standard state government reporting framework. By July 1999, it reported that its gas industry was 98 per cent ready for the Year 2000, and that 88 per cent of contingency plans were in place. Western Australia reports that by June 1999 gas distribution was 92 per cent Year 2000 ready, with 90 per cent of contingency plans in place. The Queensland government is monitoring 
 the gas industry in its jurisdiction, reporting that by August 1999 all but one of the major operators was more than 80 per cent ready.</para><para>Based on current information available through extensive reports by the gas industry, the sector is confident that gas will continue to flow on and after 1 January 2000.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Transport</inline></para><para>States and Territory Governments are generally responsible for passenger and freight road transport, passenger and freight rail services, and shipping and port facilities. Where transport activities are government-owned or controlled, advice on Year 2000 progress is contained in State and Territory Government Year 2000 Reports. Larger private entities generally report through the Australian, London or New York stock exchanges.</para><para>The Australian road transport industry consists of commercial companies that operate fleets or provide logistics services to others; independent owner-operators; and bus and coach fleets, about one third of which are government operated. The road infrastructure itself is a State and Territory Government responsibility, with the provision and maintenance of services delegated to State and Territory agencies or local government. State and Territory Government Year 2000 reporting on road transport covers road infrastructure, including signalling and traffic management systems. Where reported, readiness levels are generally above 90 per cent.</para><para>The rail operating businesses of Australian National (SA Freight, Tasrail and AN Passenger) were sold to three privately operated consortia in 1997. The interstate freight operator National Rail is owned jointly by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales and Victorian Governments. It has reported that it is scheduled to be compliant by the end of October 1999. Otherwise, the rail transport sector is predominantly State and Territory Government controlled and is part of their Year 2000 reporting frameworks. Year 2000 readiness levels of rail transport where reported by States and Territories tend to be 90 per cent or above. The reported level of contingency planning is variable.</para><para>Australia's major port facilities are owned and operated by State and Territory Governments, and are therefore part of the State and Territory Year 2000 reporting framework. Many States and Territories are reporting levels of Year 2000 readiness above 90 per cent, and some at 100 per cent. The Commonwealth Government's Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has embraced the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) <inline font-style="italic">Code of Good Practice on Y2K</inline> . The Code of Good Practice is aimed at producing a safe environment for normal business in ports and navigation during 2000.  
</para><para>From 1 July 1999, AMSA surveyors stepped up their program of checking that ships have addressed the Year 2000 issue in accordance with the Code. Ships entering Australian ports are required to demonstrate Year 2000 compliance or readiness and a satisfactory management strategy. Ship owners have been warned that from 1 November 1999 ships may be detained on a visit to an Australian port unless and until they can demonstrate adequate levels of Year 2000 preparedness. State and Territory marine authorities and/or port authorities may take action in addition to that of AMSA, depending on their legislative responsibilities.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Fuel</inline></para><para>Formal reporting on Year 2000 preparedness in the fuel sector occurs through Australian and international (New York and London) stock exchanges or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Australian Institute of Petroleum (AIP) formed a joint Year 2000 Committee with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) in 1997 to assist member companies on the Year 2000 issue. The committee is discussing contingency plans with the emergency services authorities in States/Territories. The Committee has also met with ESAA,  the New South Wales and Victorian Electricity Supply Associations and Telstra.</para><para>Along with electricity, fuel is critical to enabling normal business and community activity. Contingency plans for a range of businesses which involve backup electricity generation units generally rely on fuel for operation.</para><para>The Australian petroleum industry has examined its systems and, where necessary, remediated and tested them. The industry is reporting that remediation activity is almost complete. Supply chains have been checked. Business continuity plans are being finalised. Contingency plans are a normal part of business in the fuel industry for safety purposesâfuel is a volatile product and the safety of the public and workforce is of paramount importance. The fuel industry is IT-dependent but it also has manual back up systemsâsuch as turning valves by hand, and trucks with their own power and pumping ability to enable fuel to be moved wherever it is required.</para><para>The industry is ensuring that all parts of the supply chain are prepared and is confident that there is at least two weeks of stock within the system. This gives a very large margin of time to get the refineries operating again in the unlikely event of any disruption.</para><para>There is no need, therefore, for business or the community to stockpile fuel which could endanger public safety.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Health and Aged Care</inline></para><para>The Australian health care system involves a diversity of arrangements for planning, funding and 
 delivering health services. The sector includes the public hospital system, private hospitals, community health services, aged care facilities, doctors' surgeries, and medical services such as X-rays, pathology and blood services.</para><para>Commonwealth health policy is administered through its portfolio agencies under the Minister for Health and Aged Care. The Commonwealth contributes to funding for hospital services and some community-based health care and aged care services, and administers the Medicare Benefits Scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>Each State and Territory Government is responsible for the administration and funding of its public health authorities. Local governments and private, non-government organisations (including not-for-profit organisations) also provide health services. Most medical and dental care services are provided by private practitioners.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government and each State and Territory Government have been checking equipment and systems likely to be affected by the Year 2000 issue. Equipment and systems identified as having a problem are either being repaired or replaced and contingency plans developed to ensure services can be provided if unexpected incidents occur.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government, in partnership with general practitioners through the profession's peak national body for computing, the General Practice Computing Group, has developed a guide to assist individual general practitioners address Year 2000 issues. The guide gives doctors resources to put strategies in place which will allow them to continue to run their practices throughout this period.</para><para>The Commonwealth and the States and Territories have provided information to the nursing home and hostel sectors on preparing for the Year 2000. These aged care facilities have been encouraged to identify date sensitive electronic systems and equipment, take reasonable and necessary steps to manage risks, and prepare contingency plans.</para><para>The Health Departments of each State and Territory are already well-versed in dealing with critical incidents such as loss of power and communications or other events that could be caused by the Year 2000 issue. To deal with these incidents, hospitals and other health care facilities are putting in place plans to allow them to switch from normal operations to contingency mode with minimal disruption to the care provided to patients.</para><para>Reporting on the Year 2000 readiness of medical devices has been required by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and State and Territory Health Departments have been undertaking and/or advocating the thorough testing of medical equipment.   
</para><para>Pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers have indicated that they have undertaken thorough Year 2000 compliance reviews underpinned by appropriate testing and remediation programs, and are planning to operate normally throughout the Christmas/New Year period.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Local Government</inline></para><para>Local government provides services and infrastructure, plays a major role in environmental management, and provides leadership and governance to local communities. The key service supplied by local governments is water supply where, as noted above, good progress is being made.</para><para>Constitutional responsibility for local government rests with the States and Territories, which has resulted in development of different State and Territory systems for overseeing local government and delivering local government services. State and Territory Governments have the primary role of managing local government within their jurisdictions, legislating for and regulating local government, setting new policy directions and distributing Commonwealth funding to local government.</para><para>New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania report on the Year 2000 preparedness of local government in their State as part of their government reporting framework. Year 2000 progress is variedâalthough in all three jurisdictions there are increasing numbers of local governments reporting 100 per cent Year 2000 readiness and high levels of contingency plans complete.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">COMMUNITY INFORMATION PROGRAM</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government will distribute information to ensure Australians are kept informed of the progress being made on Year 2000 work.

The bill will also enhance the protection available to owners of registered trade marks against imported goods that bear infringing trade marks.</para><para>In 1996 the Parliament enacted legislation, the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996, to protect the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games (the Games) against ambush marketing. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Olympics, without paying for the marketing rights.</para><para>The Olympic and Paralympic Games next year are events of great national significance. These events provide unique opportunities to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. One of the critical factors in making the Games an outstanding success is the ability of the organising Committees to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. It is a massive task. It is also very expensive.</para><para>The cost of staging the Games is estimated to be over $2 billion. The costs are being shared between the organising Committees, the Government of New South Wales and, to a minor extent, the Commonwealth Government. In its 1998 Annual Report, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games estimated that it needs to raise in the vicinity of $800 million from official sponsor 
 ships and licensing fees to meet its budget for the Games.</para><para>The ability of the organising Committees to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. If the Parliament had not enacted the Sydney 2000 Games Act to protect the organising Committees against ambush marketing, the official sponsorship revenue for the Games may have been at risk. The Sydney 2000 Games Act vests the rights in the indicia and images specified in the act with the organising Committees. The act enables the organising Committees to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the act for commercial purposes.</para><para>To constitute use for commercial purposes, Games indicia or images must generally be used in a manner that falsely suggests a person is a sponsor (or supporter) of the Games. The Sydney 2000 Games Act, however, does not place an absolute fetter on the use of protected Games indicia and images. For example, the act does not effect the community's fundamental right to freedom of expression. This is particularly the case in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the use of Games indicia and images apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.</para><para>The Sydney 2000 Games Act provides various remedies to the organising Committees and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Games indicia or images in contravention of the act, an organising Committee (or a relevant licensed user) may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. I have been informed that, to date, the organising Committees have not yet needed to take any action to enforce their rights under the Sydney 2000 Games Act through the Courts.</para><para>The Sydney 2000 Games Act also includes appropriate Customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods that seek to ambush the Games marketing. These border interception provisions enable the Australian Customs Service to seize imported goods that seek to ambush the Games marketing. Once goods have been seized, Customs is required to advise the relevant organising Committee or licensed user and the designated owner of the goods of the seizure. The organising Committee or licensed user has then 10 days following seizure of the goods to commence infringement proceedings. If proceedings are not commenced within that time, the goods are returned to the owner. However, the designated owner of the goods may forfeit the goods to the Commonwealth at any time before proceedings commence. 
</para><para>Customs has seized a significant number of consignments under the border interception provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games Act and it is likely to encounter an increasing number of these consignments during the lead-up to the Games. In many cases, after Customs has seized goods, the designated owner of the seized goods has forfeited the goods to the Commonwealth thus eliminating, quickly and cheaply, potential threats to the organising Committees' revenue. In the majority of the other cases, the designated owner of the goods has complied with the organising Committees written demands.</para><para>It is these border interception provisions in the Sydney 2000 Games Act that this bill is intended to modify. The amendment proposed by this bill to the Sydney 2000 Games Act addresses a discrepancy between the seizure powers of Customs and its obligation to notify the designated owner of the seized goods under the border interception provisions of that act. The seizure power of the Sydney 2000 Games Act is in broad terms; it applies to all infringing goods. However, as I have mentioned, Customs is also obliged to notify the designated owner that the goods have been seized.</para><para>Presently, the Sydney 2000 Games Act defines the designated owner as the person identified as the owner of the goods on the `entry' made in relation to the goods under section 68 of the Customs Act 1901. However, section 68 of that act excludes several types of goods from the general requirement to be entered. For example, goods consigned by post worth less than $1000 or goods worth less than $250 consigned by other means do not have to be entered. Therefore, goods that are not entered do not have a designated owner. As a result, Customs cannot seize goods that are not entered because there is no designated owner to notify. As considerable numbers of such consignments can occur, this discrepancy undermines the intent of the border interception provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games Act.</para><para>The amendments proposed by this bill will improve the effectiveness of the Sydney 2000 Games Act by enabling Customs to seize all goods that seek to ambush the Games marketing, whether or not the goods require entry under the Customs Act.</para><para>As the border interception provisions of the Sydney 2000 Games Act were largely based on the border interception provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995, both acts share a common definition of designated owner. Therefore, this bill proposes also to make a similar amendment to the Trade Marks Act.</para><para>The amendments made by this bill are not intended to apply to all goods imported into Australia and especially not to goods imported for personal use. As I mentioned previously, goods will only infringe the Sydney 2000 Games Act if the goods are used 
 for commercial purposes and that term has a particular meaning under that act. Similarly, goods will only infringe a registered trade mark if the goods bear the trade mark, or are used in connection with the trade mark, in the course of trade.</para><para>I commend this bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till the first day of sitting in the summer sittings 1999, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION REGULATIONS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>8700</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>8700</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That Schedule 1 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 8), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 132 and made under the <inline font-style="italic">Migration Act 1958</inline> , be disallowed.</para><para>That string of numbers relates to a regulation which has extended the operation of the $1,000 post-decision fee which applies to unsuccessful applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is a matter that has been raised in this chamber a number of times. It was initially put into operation a couple of years ago. In 1997 in fact, before I came into this place, it was subject to an unsuccessful disallowance motion moved, at that time, by Senator Margetts.</para><para>At that time a two-year sunset clause was put on the $1,000 fee, and a number of other measures were introduced which were not subject to a sunset clause and which are still in place. The $1,000 fee for Refugee Review Tribunal applicants did have a sunset clause put in place, which meant that it ran out at 30 June this year. This regulation extends that sunset clause for another three years. The operation and impact of the $1,000 fee was subject to an inquiry by the joint parliamentary migration committee, of which I am a member, and the report from the government members of that committee recommended maintaining the $1,000 fee.</para><para>I and the three Labor membersâDr Theophanous, Mr Ripoll and Mrs Irwin, all from the lower houseârecommended that regulation 4.31B cease to operate after 1 July. And that is basically what this disallowance motion aims to do: it is to give effect to that recommendation. I note that Senator McKiernan, who is the other Labor member 
 on that committee and who will be speaking on this motion, did not share the view of his colleagues in that regard, and I am sure he will be outlining his rationale for that shortly.</para><para>I would say, as I do try to acknowledge with this area of law, that immigration lawârefugee law, in particularâis not an easy area and that there are a lot of competing issues that need to be addressed. I do recognise that it is appropriate for the government to try to ensure that the operation of the refugee program, the onshore humanitarian program in particular, is not abused and misused by people for inappropriate purposes. My view is that the extent of that misuse has been somewhat exaggerated by the government and the department, but I certainly would not pretend to suggest that no misuse occurs.</para><para>It is for that reason that many of the original measures were brought in in 1997, including limiting the right for people seeking protection visas to be able to work whilst they are in Australia. I think that those measures are more likely to have had an impact in stemming misuse than has this particular fee. Either way, in an issue like this, whilst there are competing policy aspects that have to be considered, I and the Democrats believe that priority has to be given to the human rights aspects of this issue and to ensuring that genuine asylum seekersâand that does not necessarily mean successful asylum seekersâare not disadvantaged.</para><para>I think the onus has to be on the government and the department to prove that there is no disadvantage being caused to those people. I believe that they certainly failed to prove that during the course of the joint committee inquiry. The government would and did argue that it has not been proven categorically that genuine applicants have been disadvantaged and have suffered as a result of this fee. I would suggest that there is some degree of evidence to the committee that that was the case, from a number of organisations that work in this area and also work with people involved in this area at community level on the ground.</para><para>My view is that there was some evidence presented that indicated that it was a potential problem, but my viewâdespite or in addition 
 to thatâis that it really is, in an area like this, up to the department to categorically prove that no disadvantage occurs. I do not think the onus of proof should operate in the other direction in that community organisations and refugee applicants should have to prove categorically that there has been disadvantage.</para><para>The inquiry heard from a number of organisations, as I mentioned, who were involved on a daily basis with onshore humanitarian refugee issues. Some were well-known ones, such as Amnesty International, the Refugee Council of Australia and the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia. There were also a number of other organisations that are not so well known but that are also very heavily involved in this area: the Refugee and Immigration Legal Service Centre, the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre, the Campbelltown Legal Centre and other more community based centres. The very strong view from those associations and organisations was that the $1,000 fee is not appropriate and does provide a potential disincentive and potential hardship for genuine refugee applicants.</para><para>It is important to emphasise and clarify in this area again that, to apply for a protection visa in Australia, peopleâif they are not successful at departmental levelâcan appeal to, and have the right of appeal to, the Refugee Review Tribunal, and that is something that the Democrats certainly support. The $1,000 fee applies if they are unsuccessful; yet it has to be emphasised that many people who do not fit the definition of `refugee' apply for a protection visa and appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</para><para>But the definition of refugee is a very narrow one. I think it is a lot narrower than many people realise, and many quite genuine humanitarian cases nonetheless do not fit the technical legal definition of a refugee and are then able to seek the operation of ministerial discretionâthat is, apply to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs asking him to exercise discretion to grant them a protection visa on humanitarian grounds. That is successful in a number of cases. I cannot think of the number off the top of my head, but certainly it is more common that people 
 are successful in that regard than they have been previously.</para><para>But, to get to that stage, even people that know they are not technically refugees but still believe they have a genuine humanitarian case have to go through the Refugee Review Tribunal anyway. Then, not surprisingly, they fail and have to seek ministerial discretion. If they get ministerial discretion, the $1,000 fee does not apply but, whilst a number of people do get support from the minister and the exercise of ministerial discretion, a number of them do notâa majority of them do not. That ministerial discretion is not compellable; it is not appealable. Regardless of how genuine their claim is and how genuine they feel it is, they have no way of knowing for sure whether or not they are going to be successful, because it is very arbitrary in the technical senseâit is a very arbitrary powerâand it is difficult for people to be certain that they will be successful in appealing to the minister.</para><para>But if they are not, regardless of how genuine their claim is, they are then subject to this $1,000 fee. I believe, and the Democrats believe, that that is completely inappropriate. I am not suggesting that the government explicitly says this, although I think sometimes it is implied somewhat. But certainly there is the suggestion out in the community from time to time that anybody who applies for a protection visa and is unsuccessful has therefore been trying to rort the system: they are either accepted and successful or they are unsuccessfulâand that means they are trying to rort the system. I think that is a misconception that we need to completely deny, because it is clearly not the case. Obviously, some people do try to misuse the system but, in my view, the vast majority of people who are unsuccessful in applying for protection visas are nonetheless genuine in their belief about the genuineness of their case and genuine in their attempts to exercise what they believe is their legal entitlement to a protection visa.</para><para>So I believe it is important, in terms of our approach to this debate within the community, to make sure that we do not allow that myth to take hold as a community perception. In my view, this $1,000 fee does reinforce that 
 perception. It is clearly a penalty or a fee which people are required to pay. If people are charged a fee for something when they are unsuccessful there is a symbolic inference that they have not been genuine in the application.</para><para>There are many other issues in relation to the operation of refugee policy which I will not go into, because I will try to confine this debate specifically to the fee. As the Senate would know, there is a committee inquiry at the moment, with the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee examining the wider operation of our refugee and humanitarian program. That committee inquiry is proving quite constructive and all parties are contributing in a cooperative way. Whilst I am not sure that I am going to be getting support from other parties for this allowance motionâalthough I certainly hope I do, because of the evidence that has been providedâI do again recognise that this is a difficult area of policy.</para><para>As I mentioned before, Senator McKiernan disagreed with his Labor colleagues on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration about the best approach with this fee. Obviously I disagreed with him on the conclusion, but I do recognise his very comprehensive understanding of the issues involved in this area and his commitment to them. But I do believe that on this particular issue it is important to come down on the side of emphasising justice and humanitarian assistance.</para><para>As I stated in a number of forums in the last couple of weeks, it is my view and the Democrats' view that a humanitarian and compassionate approach has been devalued somewhat in recent years in immigration and refugee policy. I am not in any way suggesting that our approach should be an unthinking, bleeding heartâ`Let everybody who wants to come in come in, just because we feel sorry for them'âtype of approach. I recognise that we have to put particular restrictions in place, but I do believe that the balance has got out of kilter in recent times and that this fee is one example of that. The focus has been so much on preventing rorting and on keeping so-called non-genuine people out that it may be achieving that goal to an extent but it is also penalising innocent people 
 in the process. I believe that when you get to that circumstance it clearly needs some readjustment.</para><para>In my view, disallowing this fee will not generate a huge budgetary problem and, inasmuch as it does, I do not believe it is appropriate for measures such as this to be driven by budgetary implications. The rationale for putting it in place was not cost related or for it to be a budgetary assistance measure; it was meant to be a disincentive for misuse. I do not believe it has been proven by the departmentâin fact, I am certain it has not been provenâthat it has operated in that way, that it has had that effect. But I do believe it has had an effect. Many of the organisations that work with asylum seekers in Australia believe it has had a negative effect on those people.</para><para>The majority of people that are subject to the $1,000 feeâit is worth emphasising and I am sure other speakers will do soâdo not pay it. They tend to leave the country and not pay the fee. That was an argument the department used to say that there was not much hardship being generated, because people choose not to pay it and just leave the country. Obviously the aim of the policy is to have non-genuine applicants or non-legal residents removed from the country.</para><para>The downside is that, until that $1,000 fee is paid, they are not able to return in any way or under any form of visa at all. That presents problems for genuine applicants who have gone through the process in good faith and then have that particular avenue closed off to them unless they pay that extra fee. The costs and hurdles in relation to people trying to enter Australia and trying to settle here are already fairly substantial, in the Democrats' view, and adding an extra hurdle in this regard is, in our view, inappropriate.</para><para>In conclusion, the clear evidence provided by a vast number of organisations who work very closely and heavily in this area was that this fee was not proven to be operating in a way that clearly prevented misuse of the protection visa stream, but they were almost unanimously of the view that it clearly provided a disincentive for genuine refugee applicants and seekers of protection visas on 
 humanitarian grounds. In the face of that evidenceâthe fact that it is not appropriate for it to operate as a budgetary measureâI think it is almost impossible to see how it could not impact on some genuine asylum seekers in a negative way.</para><para>The Democrats believe that it is appropriate that this disallowance motion be supported. Otherwise, we will be stuck with this for at least another three years. In that case, we certainly believe that the inappropriateness of the measure would become even more clear over that period of time. There are plenty of other measures in place that already make it difficult for people seeking humanitarian visas or protection visas in Australia. I do not believe this extra one is an appropriate one. I do urge the Senate to support the Democrats' move to disallow it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>8703</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the previous speaker, Senator Bartlett, said, regulation 4.31 has been in existence now for some two years and just under three monthsâless than 27 months. It was, when it was first introduced, made subject to a two-year sunset clause. Part of the condition of opposition support for the regulation at that time two years ago was that the regulation be subjected to a review by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration prior to the expiration of the sunset clause.</para></talk.start><para>I was a member of that committee which reviewed the regulation and the impact of the regulation. As Senator Bartlett said, I supported the majority decision of the committee which recommended at 3.35 on page 43 of the committee's report that regulation 4.31B be retained and that, to allow for a more thorough assessment of its effectiveness, it be subjected to a three-year sunset clause commencing on 1 July 1999. It is my understanding that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has agreed with that recommendation and has gone even further to make it a two-year sunset clause, which is when it will be reviewed again. That is a welcomed action by the minister. It will enable, I would think, intelligence to be gathered about the proper impact of the fee.</para><para>It was the general conclusion of the committee that two years was a very short time 
 for it to be in existence to get a proper and thorough analysis of its impact and effect. When one takes into account the fact that the fee came into being on 1 July 1997 and that it did not have an impact on many of the people who were already in the pipeline at that time and that the committee was reviewing it in the first half of this year, effectively we were looking at 12 months worth of figures. So we were not really in a position to look at all of the impact of the fee. With a further two-year sunset clause, it will enable a bodyâand I hope it would be the joint standing committeeâto undertake the review again. It will enable them to review the impact of the fee in a proper atmosphere.</para><para>Like Senator Bartlett, the Democrats and many others in this chamber, I too have a great concern about the impact of this fee on genuine refugees and genuine asylum seekers in this country. I was at pains during the inquiry to question the witnesses about the impact. As I said in my additional comment which I included with the report, I was comforted by the fact that nobody was able to point out to me or to the committee that the fee was having a negative impact or was stopping genuine asylum seekers from putting in their application to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a reassessment of their claims for protection in this country.</para><para>A person who I hold in very high regard, a person who from time to time can be a great thorn in the side of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and indeed officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, is Ms Carolyn Graydon from the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre. In Melbourne she told the committee:</para><para>From my own personal knowledge, I am not aware of any cases where I thought a person had very strong prospects of success but had been deterred by applying due to the $1,000 penalty fee. Some people are driven by such strong subjective fear that I do consider it to be unlikely that someone who faces persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, in their home country would be deterred.</para><para>Carolyn Graydon cannot be said to be a friend of the department in any shape or form. She is an excellent individual who has moved on to other things other than the Refugee and 
 Immigration Legal Centre. But Carolyn Graydon was not the only person who was questioned on this matter by me and other members of the committee. At the end of our inquiry we were not able to get the hard evidence to say that this $1,000 fee had inhibited or prevented a person who would have likely been granted refugee status in this country or protection in this country from being deterred in continuing their application to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</para><para>I wish to draw attention to the status of the people who made submissions to the committee as well as those who appeared before us. We had representatives from the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Council of Australia, the Adelaide Justice Coalition, the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, the Refugee Council of Australia and the Australian Section of the International Commission on Jurists. Those who appeared before the committee were quite a representative group of well skilled advocates for refugees and asylum seekers in this country.</para><para>There were many others who were invited to appear and give evidence to the committee. Some of those included: the Thai Welfare Association, the Tribal Refugee Welfare of Western Australia, the Kingsford Legal Centre, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Amnesty International Australia, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, Campbelltown Legal Centre, the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists, the Network for International Protection of Refugees, the Australia Family Party, the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils and the Adelaide Justice Coalition. The community was invited to give the committee evidence on this issue. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the weight of evidence did not support the proposition that this fee was preventing or inhibiting genuine asylum seekers from continuing with their applications for protection.</para><para>Ms Biok from the International Commission for Jurists gave the committee an example of how she convinced a family from Sri Lanka to continue with their refugee application when they became concerned about their 
 liability to pay a fee in the event of a failed application. Ms Biok said that she encouraged these people to continue with their application despite their worries. The family was granted protection in Australia. When granted protection they are not liable to pay the fee.</para><para>Mr Bitel from the International Commission of Jurists gave the committee an example of the inconvenience caused to an applicant from the Philippines. The asylum seeker failed in his application and returned to his homeland. He was later able to return to Australia after the fee had been paid. The interesting point is that this individual was returned to his homeland and was then allowed to leave his homeland again and make an application for refugee status in this country.</para><para>Another example of inconvenience was given to the committee by Ms Jennifer Burn from the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre. She provided a case study of the inconvenience caused for a failed asylum seeker who later returned to Australia under a different visa class. The committee did not have the opportunity to examine all of the details of the particular example given, but we do know that the individual returned on a spouse visa. Would it not be better to make the application under a spouse visa in the first instance rather than trying to engage Australia's protective mechanisms? That is part of the difficulty we have in this area.</para><para>It was admitted by a number of witnesses, including the Adelaide Justice Coalition, that there is a great measure of abuse occurring in the refugee application system in this country. That is a fact. This $1,000 fee is supposed to, in some way, curtail that problem. It has probably had some effect. I do not believe the committee was in a position, given the short time the $1,000 fee was in operation, to reach the conclusion that it was having the effect the government hoped it would have. The fact that, at the time the committee was inquiring, some $370,000 was collected from the fee is an indication that it was having some impact. I understand that figure is now closer to half a million dollars. I do not believe that half a million dollars in the immigration portfolio is seen to be a revenue measure as such. Nonetheless, it would look very nice on the bottom 
 line. As I understand it, it goes into consolidated revenue rather than back into the immigration portfolio budget.</para><para>Things were happening far too quickly in the process. Eighteen months was too short a period under which to conduct a proper review of the impact of the regulation. As I said in an earlier part of my speech, I was comforted by the fact that the genuine refugee, the genuine asylum seeker, was still able to continue with his or her application through the review mechanism.</para><para>The Joint Standing Committee on Migration had a specific brief which was to look at the impact of the regulation. The committee did not have a brief to look at the operation of the exercise of the ministerial discretion to issue a humanitarian visa as such. We were inhibited in looking at that. I accept what you said, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, in your contribution to the debate that there are people who have to go through the refugee application process in order to reach the minister to get humanitarian consideration. That is not something that the committee made recommendations on because we did not have a brief on that. I think there is a general view in the community that this procedure is somewhat convoluted and messy and does leave the refugee application system open to a form of abuse by some. It is something that has to be addressed and addressed properly by perhaps another parliamentary committee. I will not go into that matter any further at the moment.</para><para>I want to conclude my remarks by welcoming the minister's response to the report and the fact that there will be another review within two years. If that review occurs in the first half of 2001, the $1,000 regulation will have then been in existence for some three years plus. I think that would be quite a useful time period to properly analyse its impact and effect. I hope that, during that period, no genuine asylum seeker is removed from this country or is refouled under the terms of the various international conventions that Australia has agreed to be part of and has signed up to.</para><para>I am comforted, as I said in my additional comment in the report, by the fact that the 
 minister still has a discretion and that people who are applying through the system for protection in Australia and who are going to the primary stage and the review stage know about the ministerial discretion and are making application to the minister. I am also comforted by the fact that the minister is responding and issuing humanitarian visas after consideration. Whether he is getting each and every one of them right is a matter for conjecture, but the evidence was not given to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. When we are dealing with matters such as we are dealing with at the moment, we do have to rely on hard evidence. If that hard evidence were there, I am sure the Refugee Council of Australia, the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre, the International Commission of Jurists and other bodies like that would be in the forefront of presenting that evidence to a parliamentary committee such as the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</para><para>I have devoted my remarks to merely a personal sense because of my involvement in the joint standing committee that reviewed the regulation and presented the report to the parliament earlier this year. The matter, however, has been discussed by my party in our caucus, and in that caucus meeting we have determined to oppose the disallowance of the regulation. Whilst I have spoken personally, I am representing the position of the Australian Labor Party in this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>8705</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, I rise to support your disallowance motionâfor the record, it should be noted that the mover of the disallowance motion, Senator Bartlett, is now in the chair as the Acting Deputy Presidentâand I do so for the very reasons you have advanced. I will not speak long because it is obvious that, if you call that the ayes have it from that exalted position, you might get a call for a division. Senator McKiernan has advised the Senate that the opposition will be voting with the government to defeat the disallowance motion, so there is not much point in my pursuing it further.</para></talk.start><para>With respectâand I say that deliberately because those who have preceded me, Senator McKiernan and Senator Bartlett, know far 
 more about this matter than I doâI might take up a point Senator McKiernan raised. Senator McKiernan was emphasising the point that this $1,000 fee was not a deterrent. I think he has a point, frankly; it is not a deterrent as such. But it may be for some who have a really genuine belief that they will be persecuted if returned to their country of origin.</para><para>If they have that genuine belief, then it may deter them, bearing in mind they may have been advised by their solicitors that, if the appeal were made to the Refugee Review Tribunal, that tribunal may on balance consider that their genuine belief was not a well-founded fear. They may have that genuine fear, they may believe sincerely, they themselves might feel that is the case, but on balance the Refugee Review Tribunal may say, `No, that is not well-founded fear of persecution on convention grounds'âthat is, the refugee convention grounds. But there again, those individuals may have a well-founded fear on grounds other than the convention grounds. We have been through this in the recent discussions of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee which is chaired by Senator McKiernan.</para><para>I will go to another point. It may not be a deterrent, but it may be a penalty for persons who are very concerned and are genuine applicants. The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its submission, stated:</para><para>Migration regulation 4.31Bâ</para><para>that is the regulation which we are seeking to disallowâ</para><para>is much too blunt an instrument and will deny to many genuine claimants their entitlement to an effective procedure and to non-refoulment. If the government is concernedâ</para><para>this is a very important observationâ</para><para>that some applicants to the Refugee Review Tribunal are unmeritorious or abusing the system, the appropriate response is not to penalise all unsuccessful applicants, as the present regulation does, but to give the tribunal discretion to impose a fee where it finds that an application is vexatious or an abuse of process.</para><para>I have not heard any arguments rejecting that view of the Human Rights and Equal Oppor 
 tunity Commission. The parliamentary secretary may direct our attention to any view of the government with respect to that statement by the commission. But I think that is quite a reasonable approach to take. Why not? Why penalise the genuine people? As I say, they are genuine, because Australia, unlike most countries, just does not have an onshore humanitarian visa. That really is a problem when it comes to questions as to whether refoulement might take place, because of the genuine fear of persecution on grounds other than the refugee convention grounds; so, for example, under the convention on torture and on the ICCPR.</para><para>Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask the minister: what is wrong with taking up the suggestion that was made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission? Why not allow this regulation to be disallowed, vote for the disallowance, then bring in further regulations which will enable the Refugee Review Tribunal discretion to impose a fee where it finds that an application is vexatious or there is an abuse of process? I will leave it at that. I will be interested to hear the response of the minister. But I think that would surely be the fair way of going about it. As it is, it is more costly to get to the Refugee Review Tribunal, if you are talking as though this $1,000 fee were a sinker, than it is to get to the High Court.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>8706</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions. The government opposes the motion by Senator Bartlett to disallow schedule 1 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 8) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 132. I remind senators that only applicants whose review is unsuccessful are liable to pay the fee. What I am saying may be a little disjointed, as I am responding; usually one gives a speech and does not respond, but I asked to speak last so that I could have the opportunity of responding. In response to what Senator Harradine just said, I point out that it is actually not a penalty; it is a fee. If you take the view that it is a 
 penalty, then of course you might look at what Senator Harradine was suggesting.</para></talk.start><para>We also have to remember that the people who are in this situation have been through a first process. When Senator Harradine indicates that they may have a fear, it is a well-founded fear. It has been indicated that around 90 per cent of review applicants are unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal, because they have already been through a first process. There has been one decision made already. If the applicant has strong claims outside the UNHCR convention, then this can be picked up in the minister's public interest powers following the Refugee Review Tribunal. So if the person is reviewed and the review is unfavourable and the minister then intervenes, the fee is no longer liable to be paid or, if it is already paid, it is refunded to the applicant. If the person is a genuine applicant, they have already been through one process, then they go into the Refugee Review Tribunal, and they all then have the chance of the minister intervening.</para><para>If a person has a well-founded fear, and they are genuine, they ought to believe that through that process they will be accepted and therefore not liable for the fee. Also the fee can be waived in certain circumstances. It was introduced to minimise abuse of the protection visa system by non-genuine applicants seeking to delay their departure and to access various benefits in Australia. At the time of the introduction, it was agreed that there be a two-year sunset clause ending on 30 June with a review by the joint standing committee to be completed on that date. The majority of the committee concluded that a significant amount of abuse was occurring. I think that is something that needs to be taken into consideration. There was a significant amount of abuse occurring. The fee has not deterred genuine refugees from applying for review. It was not in breach of Australia's international obligations to refugees. The extension of the sunset clause by two years to 1 July 2001, together with a review within that period, is consistent with the majority recommendation of the joint committee.</para><para>Supporting the motion that Senator Bartlett has proposed would mean that abuse of the 
 refugee system of review would continue and non-refugees would no longer have a debt recorded against their name if they did not pay the fee. They could reapply to obtain a visa to re-enter Australia, without making any contribution to the costs incurred by the Australian taxpayer in their misuse of the protection visa system.</para><para>In response to some of the things that Senator Bartlett said, not one case was identified in the course of the inquiry into the sunset clause where a person who was a refugee or who had good claims was deterred from going to the RRT. As I said before, it is not a penalty; it is a fee. There is no need for presumptions about motives of the individuals. It acts as a general disincentive for those who are not genuine in their motives. Those who depart instead of paying can always be given time to pay off the fee if they want a visa to return, and Senator McKiernan gave an example of that.</para><para>I have to say that the more experience I have in this portfolioâand I acknowledge Senator McKiernan's long interest in this portfolio, and I think Senator Harradine said that Senator McKiernan knows more about it than he does, and I am sure he knows a lot more about it than I do; I have been on a steep learning curveâmy great concern is that every person who comes here, who somehow manipulates their way through the system and who is not a genuine refugee takes the place of someone else, many of them languishing in camps with no place to go. I believe it is our responsibility to ensure as far as we humanly can that people apply appropriatelyâand Senator McKiernan gave the example of the fellow who was able to reapply for a spouse visa. Every single one of those people who can come to Australia as a skilled migrant or on a spouse visa but chooses to apply in the refugee category and is not a genuine refugee takes the place of a person who has no homeland to go to or who is at risk of persecution or death on return to their homeland. That is the real balance.</para><para>I think any minister for immigration needs to have the wisdom of Solomonâchop the baby into 140 pieces instead of into two. In this process, where an administrative decision 
 is made, they can appeal that administrative decision through the refugee tribunal, and if they are successful there is no fee incurred. They can then appeal to the minister. If the minister intervenes and gives them a favourable outcome, again they pay the money in return or incur no fee.</para><para>I would have to concur with Senator McKiernan that we should leave this in place to see its effect, and I am sure we will be told in no uncertain terms by the people in the industry if they believe that people who are genuine refugees are being disadvantaged or there is a disincentive for them to continue in the review process. I believe we will be told very clearly.</para><para>I have just been advised by one of the officers that a recent investigation undertaken by the principal migration officer in Manila highlights the extent of the problem. Of 1,500 applicants for spouse visas submitted since January 1998, about 300 had applied for protection while on visits to Australia. The majority had also sought review by the refugee tribunal of primary decisions and requested ministerial intervention. Ninety-seven per cent of the group admitted to making frivolous protection claims solely for the purpose of obtaining permission to work. I repeat: 97 per cent of the group admitted to making frivolous protection claims solely for the purpose of obtaining permission to work.</para><para>When I visited Hong Kong a couple of years ago, I was taken by a friend to the central square on Sunday where I saw the ayahs from the Philippines. I do not know whether Senator Harradine has been there on a Sunday. I saw maybe 8,000 to 10,000 Filipino women who were working in Hong Kong having their lunch, chatting, talking and meeting because they cannot invite anybody back to their very small room, maybe off the laundry in the facilities. When I sat on a bus with a woman who was working as an ayah at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, she said to me, `I have been here for 10 years as an ayah. I have a 14-year-old child and a 12-year-old child back in the Philippines and my husband and my parents look after them.' I realised then why some of them may want to come here and have the ability to work: some 
 of them could earn a salary that would take years and years to earn as an ayah in Hong Kong. It is a tragedy that they are in that situation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>âWhat has that got to do with it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âThat may explain why some people will make every attempt possible to be here and will make frivolous claims. Senator Harradine asks me what is the point. Well, there are lots of points. Ninety-seven per cent of this group admitted to making frivolous protection claims solely for the purpose of obtaining permission to work. The reason they want to work is that they cannot get employment in their own countries and, if they go to other countries like Hong Kong, they earn so little, but they are prepared to leave their families, their young children, to go to work to send money back to the Philippines. The motivating factors to make a frivolous claim are so strong. I understand that. I feel terrible about it, but that is one of the reasons why. Manila is now receiving about five new cases a week under the spouse category with the same profile: people who admit that they are making frivolous claims.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>âWhat has that got to do with this debate?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>âI am not going to have a debate with Senator Harradine here.

A few points need to be re-emphasised. Suggesting that this $1,000 fee is not a penalty but a fee is perhaps the case in some very narrow legal sense but, like other arguments we have had in this place about the difference between a surcharge and a tax, the impact is still the same. I am not sure that it serves the debate much to try to deny that it has a penalising effect on people who are subject to the $1,000 fee. It is a bit of a spurious distinction that is being made.</para></talk.start><para>I have been surrounded by commentary from the parliamentary secretary about abuse of the systemâwidespread rorting and non-genuine claims, et cetera. This highlights the point that I want to make initially: clearly, there is an implication that a black-and-white approach is adopted to people who are not successful through the RRT. They are successful and they wear the white hats, or they are unsuccessful and they wear the black hatsâand there is no problem with such people having a $1,000 penalty, or a $1,000 fee, put upon them.</para><para>Clearly, there are people misusing the system; nobody denies that. But, equally clearly, it would be helpful if the government acknowledged just as categorically that there are many genuine people making genuine applications who are unsuccessful. This point was highlighted most clearly by the Refugee Council of Australia in their submission. I will quote from it because it puts the point particularly well and it is worth emphasising. They state:</para><para>Official statements about this abuse tend to be very black and whiteâeither a person is a Convention refugee or they are abusing the system. RCOA would argue that the reality is more complex and there are many reasons and motivations behind applications for refugee status. These include:</para><para>. people with a well founded fear of returning to their country of origin on grounds consistent with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees;  
</para><para>. people with well founded fears of returning to their country for non-Convention reasons, such as the fact that their country is in a state of civil war and they fear generalised violence;</para><para>. people with compelling family or medical (eg a condition for example, a condition for which treatment does not exist in their country) reasons to remain in Australia which properly ought to be brought to the Minister's attention;</para><para>. people who have no reason not to return other than a desire to extend their stay and who have sought advice from agents who have promised them a `work visa'. . . Commonly in such cases the applicant had no notion that this hinged on an application for a protection visa or that their conduct was in fact abusiveâ</para><para>and evidence has been provided to parliamentary committees about that practiceâ</para><para>. people wishing to extend their stay in Australia (for economic or lifestyle reasons) and who apply for a protection visa knowing full well that it is not applicable to them.</para><para>Out of all those categories, clearly only the first group has a legitimate so-called refugee based reason to apply. But it is equally legitimate that only the last group is knowingly abusing the system. People in those interim groups are people who believe they have quite genuine humanitarian reasons, as Senator Harradine outlined. They may even be aware that they are not strictly eligible for refugee status and may go through this process to request the minister to give humanitarian consideration to their case.</para><para> It is also important to emphasise the evidence provided by people in the community about people who have been poorly or improperly advised by migration agentsânot even necessarily migration agents but people who are not qualified to give advice but who provide them with that adviceâand who act upon that in good faith. That clearly occurs in some circumstances. Evidence was given of people turning up to the refugee tribunal not even being aware until they had got there that what they had applied for was a protection visa. They thought that they had applied for a work visa, because that was what they had been advised. Those sorts of instances need to be acknowledged, and innocent people should not be penalised because of that situation.</para><para>It is worth emphasising again that this $1,000 fee was just one of a number of measures designed to stop abuse. I believe a number of those, and particularly the one in relation to people seeking to apply for a protection visa solely so they can work, were addressed by some of the regulations that were brought into place at the same time as this one. Whilst I have concerns about that as well in terms of it impacting on genuine asylum seekers, that would be far more effective in providing a disincentive for people who are deliberately abusing the system.</para><para>The fundamental point here is that it seems to me a bit incongruous for such a strong argument to be put forward by the government that this fee is providing a clear disincentive for non-genuine applicants and yet that it is somehow not providing a disincentive for genuine applicants, particularly those who may know they are not necessarily refugees in the strict sense of the word but are going through the channels they have to go through to access the minister's humanitarian consideration, something that has to be a bit of a lotteryâand that is not meant to impugn the minister's motives at all.</para><para>It is hard enough to be sure about your chances when you are going through a normal legal process and you have people looking at the legislation and giving you legal opinions. When you have something that is a non-compellable, non-reviewable discretionary power of the minister based on humanitarian considerationsâand I know there are guidelines in relation to thoseâyour chances of predicting your success are much lower than in any normal legal process. Yet people have to go through this channel and have to put themselves at the risk of being subjected to this $1,000 fee to get humanitarian consideration. That, to me, seems to be a significant flaw. To suggest that somehow the risk of a $1,000 fee is a clear disincentive for non-genuine people yet is no disincentive at all for genuine applicants who have no way of knowing whether they going to be successful is a pretty hard argument to follow.</para><para>I emphasise again that the Democrats and I believe that when you have issues that have 
 to be weighed upâsuch as the issue of abuse of the system versus ensuring that genuine applicants do not get disadvantagedâyou have to put a very strong emphasis on the human rights obligations of ensuring that disadvantaged people are not further disadvantaged and are not subject to more disincentives or hardship. When you are looking at balancing those arguments, from the Democrats' point of view you have to come down on the side of human rights. I believe you have to come down on ensuring that the department has to prove that there is no hardship rather than the community or others having to prove the contrary. That is a crucial point in terms of how we should approach these issues.</para><para>Unfortunately, the disallowance motion is not going to be successful. Despite what I believe are my very telling points, I suspect I am not going to sway the Senate at this late stage, so I will not continue. Another sunset clause will now operate with this regulation. There will be a review, and I will certainly be watching that closely. We may even be revisiting this debate in a couple of years time. One hopes that it is conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, a committee that I find operates very constructively with difficult issues and works hard to get a consensus approach. I hope some of the arguments that I put forward today get greater acceptance in the committee next time we are reviewing this matter.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Deputy PresidentâSenator S.

The most significant of these is the inclusion of accommodation charges in the act. We all remember the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, appearing on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline>  to announce the backdown on the government's aged care policy, but we are only now seeing the legislation to implement that backdown.</para></talk.start><para>Until now the accommodation charges he announced have been implemented through subordinate legislation, without the proper scrutiny of parliament. We are now also told that, because of his ad hoc arrangements, residents paying the charge have been denied basic protections. Labor opposed the introduction of the accommodation charge. We had very serious concerns about the equity of requiring pensioners to pay thousands of dollars a year for nursing home care. Those 
 concerns remain. However, as those charges have been implemented, we support any move to introduce better protection measures for residents paying the $12 a day fee. We do have serious concerns that the protections introduced in this bill do not go far enough, and we will be moving amendments to increase residents' rights in relation to accommodation, bonds and charges. The government abrogated its responsibility two years ago by introducing the charges without those protections. </para><para>The bill makes a number of technical amendments to address problems with the act, which include providing for the refund of accommodation charges to residents who were in homes prior to October 1997âhonoured only after Labor pressured the government to fulfil its commitments to those residentsâensuring that people were not liable for fees and charges before they have even agreed to move into a facility, clarifying the situation where a person admitted to a facility has a mental impairment, formalising reduced qualifying periods for co-residents, and broadening the definition of `family'. Labor supports all of these amendments. They are a belated attempt to fix up some of the problems with the Aged Care Actâproblems that the government has been aware of for more than 18 months now.</para><para>Unfortunately for older Australians, while the bill does fix up some of the many technical problems associated with the government's Aged Care Act, many significant problems with the act are not addressed by this bill and will remain. These problems include: difficulties with the government's income tested fee, which has caused significant distress to older Australians and their families and is forcing providers to divert resources away from the care of residents; problems over the use of capital funding in the sector; an inability to appropriately deal with poor providers, including the closure of poor providers and provisions for the investigation of residents' complaints; significant difficulties being experienced by providers with the government's new resident classification scale; difficulties in accessing aged care, as the ratio of places to people aged 70 and over has declined over 
 the last three years and waiting times have increased; a blow-out in the budget for aged care, which has occurred alongside the reduced access because of the government's misdirection of taxpayers' dollars; the continued implementation of the government's coalescence policy, which has been described by the Productivity Commission as inappropriate and inequitable; and providers in some states facing very serious problems arising from workers compensation premium increases without any support from the government, which is resulting in a reduction in the quality of care to residents.</para><para>These and a number of other problems have emerged as a result of the failure of the government's aged care reforms. The hasty changes introduced in fright in 1997 are now falling apart. They have reduced access to residential aged care, and they have forced providers to compromise on the quality of care delivered to residents. They are failed reforms. These problems are causing distress to older Australians and their families and, in some cases, are forcing providers to reduce the quality of care delivered to residents. What is inexcusable is that the government has known about these problems for some time, yet it has done nothing to address them.</para><para>The two peak provider organisations in the sector have raised serious concerns about the minister's inaction in relation to the issues confronting the industry. A recent journal included a headline article from the chief executive officer of one of those organisations, entitled `Government inactivity', that indicated that `issues currently affecting the operation of the aged care facilities are reaching crisis point.' Uniting Community Services has also stated that the minister's inaction in relation to the comprehensive Productivity Commission report into the nursing home sector is a time bomb and that older Australians deserve better.</para><para>This bill provided the government with the perfect opportunity to respond to the concerns of residents and their families and to providers and employees in the aged care sector, yet it has merely sought to recycle an 18-month-old bill that does nothing to fix the many problems that have emerged over the last 18 
 months. Because of the government's inaction, Labor will move amendments to the bill to attempt to address some of the issues facing this sector as a result of the failure of the aged care reforms.</para><para>The only reason we are debating this bill today is that Labor put pressure on the government to meet its commitment to residents in nursing homes before 1 October 1997. These residents were promised by the Prime Minister that they would not have to pay the $12 a day accommodation charge, but nothing was done to implement that promise. It was only after pressure from the Labor opposition and questions in the parliament in April that Senator Herron finally committed the government to meeting those commitments to those residents in the 1999-2000 budget.</para><para>One and a half years after the government introduced its aged care reforms, the government finally undertook to honour its commitments to them. Unfortunately, many of those residents have since passed away. Because of the government's reluctance to implement its commitments, not one of them has received any refund of the potential millions of dollars they have paid in total in accommodation chargesâcharges that they should never have paid.</para><para>Almost two years after the reforms were introduced, these residents are still required to pay the $12 a day charge. They are still facing financial pressureâpressure to sell their homes and somehow come up with the $12 a day charge when the government has promised they would not have to pay the charge. This is a tragic situation caused by the government's reluctance to act. These residents rightly feel cheated by the government, and the government failed to respond by introducing this bill until June 1999. This, of course, is consistent with its reluctance to debate aged care. The government seems desperate to keep aged care off the political agenda, given the history of losing two ministers in trying to implement these reforms.</para><para>I have raised the government's inaction in relation to aged care on a number of occasions in the past. The history of this 
 government's failure in aged care was discussed broadly in the house when this bill was debated in June, and I will not seek to repeat some of that debate today. But the earlier bill that the government introduced was then withdrawn by it. Knowing the problems being experienced by residents and providers, the government chose to drop the bill that sought to fix some of the problems. Facing an election, the government put its own political interests ahead of the interests of aged care residents. Eighteen months later, under pressure from Labor, the government finally sought to introduce legislation when it took the opportunity to recycle the 1998 bill.</para><para>The provisions to provide for the refund of accommodation charges to pre-October 1997 residents, inserted at our insistence, are the only major changes to the bill tabled in March last year. Given the history of inaction, it is not surprising that the minister has failed to address a number of significant problems within the Aged Care Act that have become apparent over the last 18 months. In the context of this bill, I will be highlighting just three of the problems now facing the aged care sector: the income tested fee, capital funding and how we deal with poor providers.</para><para>In terms of the income tested fee, there have been numerous reports in the media recently about the problems with the government's income tested fee. We have heard that aged care residents are receiving a series of letters from the department, sometimes within a matter of days, each indicating a different level of fee. In one case the department sent three letters to a resident in two days, advising of three different levels of fee. Understandably, residents are confused and upset by this inconsistent advice. Residents, many of whom are pensioners, are rightly distressed when they are then hit with bills for thousands of dollars as a result of the department's confusion.</para><para>At the same time, providers are complaining about the complexity of the fee which is requiring more and more staff resources to administer. This means more staff filling in forms and less time caring for residents. These problems flow from the government's bungled implementation of the fee, which was 
 criticised in the recent Audit Office report. That report identifies significant problems with the fee's implementation and ongoing complexity in its administration.</para><para>In the face of all these problems, it is not surprising that we have also been getting reports that the department is advising people to divorce to avoid the income tested fee. You know a system has failed when the department's officers advise people to divorce to avoid it. These problems were raised by the sector with the government over a year ago, yet the minister has done nothing to relieve the distress of residents and their relatives. She did not take the opportunity provided by this bill to address those problems. It is just not good enough. Residents continue to receive confusing advice and continue to be upset by large bills for backdated fees that they did not even know they had to pay. Labor calls on the government to urgently introduce legislation to resolve the many problems with the income tested fee and thereby relieve the distress of residents and their families.</para><para>I turn to the question of capital funding. A few weeks ago I mentioned an example which graphically demonstrates the failure of the government's arrangements to fund capital improvements in the residential aged care sector. A Victorian nursing home provider closed his facility after it appeared he did little or nothing to improve the infrastructure of the facility. Residents at the nursing home had been paying the government's $12 a day accommodation charge. The Commonwealth had been paying on behalf of other residents the equivalent through the concessional resident supplement.</para><para>In total up to $200,000 could have been paid to the provider to fix up the nursing home, yet he was under no obligation to spend any of that money on capital works, and it appeared that he did not do so. Instead he chose to leave the industry and pocket the funds. The minister cannot guarantee residents or taxpayers that one dollar of the $200,000 was actually spent on improving the nursing home.</para><para>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. In Victoria, in particular, there have been a 
 number of recent instances where aged care facilities have closed their doors. In all these recent cases, the provider has been under no obligation to spend the funds collected from residents through an accommodation bond or charge on capital improvements. In all cases, the provider has been under no obligation to spend taxpayers' money collected through the concessional resident supplement on capital improvements. In all cases, the provider can simply pocket the money and walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars. This bill does nothing to prevent that circumstance recurring.</para><para>While the providers who close down their facilities in these circumstances are few and represent the small minority of irresponsible providers in the system, there are other providers who are using the funds raised through the accommodation bonds and charges to cover ongoing costs. Under the current system, they are perfectly entitled to do so. These providers have the interests of residents at heart and are compensating for a lack of recurrent funding by dipping into their capital funding stream. Unfortunately for the provider, this has long-term consequences as these providers will have little or no means of refurbishing their facilities in five or 10 years time.</para><para>The current system is disguising the crisis in ongoing funding that many providers are facingâa crisis that the Productivity Commission identified in its recent report into nursing home funding. Some providers are sacrificing future capital reserves to meet current costs. Accommodation charges were introduced to fund capital improvements. We do the residents, the providers or the taxpayers no favours by refusing to quarantine those funds. I think this highlights a significant failing of the current Aged Care Act.</para><para>The funds collected from residents are not quarantined specifically for capital improvements. Attempts were made by both Labor and the Democrats at the time the act was passed to tighten accountability for the use of these funds. However, they were resisted by the government and the current arrangements have proved to be ineffective. At the time Labor raised the very possibility of the situa 
 tion that has unfolded with providers simply incorporating the capital funds into their daily budgets. The minister has proudly produced graphs showing the amounts the new user-pays fees raise and claims that this will meet the capital needs of the sector, but she cannot guarantee that one dollar of that money is actually spent on capital improvements.</para><para>Nursing home residents have been told they must find $12 a day to fund the capital development of the aged care sector when many of them simply cannot afford it, and the government has not put any accountability arrangements in place to ensure that the money is directed to improving their accommodation. It must be remembered that accommodation bonds and charges are only half the picture. We know that 47 per cent of residents are not paying any accommodation bond or charge. In this case the Commonwealth pays the provider $12.34 a day through the concessional resident supplement. There is no provision in the current Aged Care Act that defines what that money should be used for. Providers are able to simply pocket that money. This year the Commonwealth will spend $142 million on the concessional supplement, next year it will be $169 million and the year after that $181 million, yet we have put no conditions on how that money should be used. Given that the concessional resident supplement is paid when the resident cannot afford an accommodation bond or charge, the clear intention is that the supplement be used for capital improvement. The Aged Care Act does not reflect that intention. We will move amendments to try to ensure that funds raised from residents through their accommodation bonds and charges are used for capital improvements and that taxpayers' dollars spent on the concessional resident supplement are similarly used for that purpose.</para><para>Where a provider closes a facility, forcing residents to relocate to other facilities, the provider will have to ensure that the money is used for those purposes or refund it to taxpayers and residents if it has not been used on capital improvements. A provider should not be allowed to accumulate these funds, knowing that they will close down, do no 
 capital improvements and simply walk away with the money. That is a very real issue as accreditation approaches. The current arrangements encourage providers in this situation to do no capital improvement. Our amendments will require providers to refund any moneys collected through the accommodation bonds or charges or the concessional resident supplement when that money has not been or will not be spent on capital improvements. If a resident pays $12 a day to the provider for that purpose and the provider chooses not to spend that money on improving the facility, the resident is entitled to a refund of the money.</para><para>The recent cases in Victoria also highlight another significant problem in the government's Aged Care Actâhow to deal with poor providers. The department have indicated to me that there are a small number of providers that they would like to close down but cannot because of difficulties with the act. As a result, the government is now proposing an amendment that will allow for the gradual wind-down of a facility when it wants to revoke a provider's approval to operate. While I can understand the rationale for this amendment, it raises significant issues over the care of residents in a facility that is being wound down and poses real risks to their health. These residents will potentially be left for an extended period in a facility that has been assessed as not providing an adequate level of care. Given the shortage of alternative places in some areas, the resident may have to wait for months as the facility is gradually wound down. In this situation, there is a clear need to ensure that these residents are being appropriately cared for. We should not set up a situation where we leave residents in a facility under the control of a provider who is known to have acted irresponsibly in failing to provide appropriate care to residents.</para><para>The problem will only get worse as the January 2001 accreditation deadline approaches and some providers make a decision to leave the industry and make as much money as they can in the process. They will be looking to cut staff hours and reduce the level of care provided to residents. They will be 
 looking to cut back on the quality of food and generally looking to save costs. It has to be remembered that residents are potentially in a very vulnerable position. Some of them may have no relatives within the area to regularly visit them, some may be suffering dementia, all of them are physically frail. I find it appalling that the government is now proposing an amendment to allow a known poor provider to continue to operate for six or 12 months, while the facility is gradually wound down, without providing extensive additional protections for the residents. The provider knows they are being closed down and therefore has every reason to try to extract the most money they can from the facility in the time remaining, which means reducing the quality of care to an intolerable minimum. I have serious concerns about the provisions in the act in relation to the investigation of complaints. Many people have noted the current provisions do not ensure that complaints are promptly and thoroughly investigated. To rely on these provisions in the case where a known poor provider is allowed to continue to operate a facility is inviting disaster. The Labor opposition will move amendments to ensure that the care of residents in this situation is monitored by a departmental officer who will report directly to the minister.</para><para>We will also move amendments that seek to protect the interests of employees when a nursing home is closing down. We know of a number of instances where staff have been left owed large amounts of moneyâtermination and leave payâby providers exiting the industry without meeting their obligations. The department has the ability to prevent the sale of the licence if those debts are not met, and we think it is an important reform to provide for those employees. The government has accepted the need to protect employees in these situations in other industries, and we think it should accept its responsibilities in the nursing home industry as well.</para><para>I look forward to contributing in the committee stage of the debate to this important legislation. We have tried to highlight that we do not think this legislation goes far enough as a legislative response to the problems 
 confronting aged care. Many of the problems have not been addressed. We think the government should have a much more comprehensive response to the issues confronting the industry. We will attempt at the committee stage to deal with some of those, but we really do require a more comprehensive legislative response, and we require a government commitment to address the issues in the industry rather than delay, defer and hope that somehow they will go away. There are real problems that need to be addressed, and I urge the government to start being accountable and to start addressing those concerns of the industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>8716</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="r842">Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999</inline> , which we are considering today, introduces a number of amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 and the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act 1997 to finetune the aged care structural reforms which were introduced in October 1997. In addition, it addresses some administrative and procedural issues which have become evident since that time. It also introduces a number of protection measures for older Australians living in residential aged care facilities, which the Democrats particularly welcome. We are happy to support this bill today.</para></talk.start><para>Since the government first announced its sweeping reforms of the funding and operation of residential aged care facilities in 1996, the Democrats have worked very hard to improve the government's policy reform package. Our goal has always been to ensure that the final package was one which would ensure that the needs of those requiring residential aged care both now and in the future would be met. What we have always wanted is a system which is sustainable while offering high quality care to all Australians, regardless of their capacity to pay.</para><para>In determining our position in the aged care debate since 1996 we have carefully weighed up each proposal against its likely impact on the ability of elderly Australians to access high quality residential care and the long-term financial viability of the residential aged care sector. The Democrats gave qualified support to the government's initial aged care reform 
 package, because we understood the urgent need to inject funding for capital maintenance and improvements into residential aged care facilities. We negotiated a number of improvements to the original proposal, including an additional $40 million in subsidies for concessional residents. We wanted to ensure that all Australians could continue to access high quality residential aged care, regardless of their ability to pay for it.</para><para>Recently, the Democrats also played a crucial role in paving the way for the introduction of an accreditation system for residential aged care facilities, which was proposed as part of the government's 1996 aged care reform package, with funding for all non-accredited aged care facilities to cease from 1 January 2001. While the majority of aged care providers supported an accreditation process, the details of the legislation were not agreed to until the Democrats brokered a roundtable discussion between providers and the minister. As a result of this meeting, the minister has agreed to address the major concerns of the aged care sector, including making a commitment that residential aged care facilities with up to 19 beds will pay no fee for accreditation, and those with 20 to 25 beds will pay only a tapered fee on an ongoing basis.</para><para>The Democrats are proud to have been able to play a central role in resolving the impasse between the government and the aged care providers over the accreditation process for aged care facilities. I believe the introduction of accreditation will be a big step forward for those needing residential aged care. It should lead to continuous improvements in the industry and ultimately a higher standard of care and facilities for older Australians.</para><para>On reading the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I notice that the opposition have used the debate surrounding this bill as yet another excuse to beat up the government on aged care. No doubt, they will turn their attack on the Democrats in the Senate as well. Before the senators in the ALP start with the kind of tiresome rhetoric and half-truths we have heard time and time again, let me just take the opportunity today to remind them that the ALP had 13 years in government to 
 address the problems in aged care, and they did not.</para><para>The ALP did virtually nothing, despite the findings of the Gregory report, which was commissioned by the Keating government. The ALP did nothing, despite the fact that its own independent report estimated that approximately $1 billion in today's figures was needed just to get the existing nursing home stock up to scratch. Let us not forget that, when it comes to aged care, the opposition has a very poor record indeed. In fact, it has failed dismally.</para><para>Let us also not forget that, going into the last election, the only promise the ALP could come up with in relation to aged care was to abolish all nursing home fees and replace them with $500 million of public money to be paid to the sector over three years. I invite ALP senators here tonight to explain to us exactly how this $500 million was going to meet the current and ongoing funding needs of the aged care sector. In fact, I challenge the opposition to change their approach when it comes to aged care. Perhaps just for this bill, rather than resorting to rhetoric and half-truths to bag everything and everyone on what they have tried to do, why not try something different? Why not use this as an opportunity to tell the rest of us what the ALP aged care policies would be if they were in government?</para><para>Before the government gets too complacent from all of this criticism of the opposition's approach to aged care, let me take a few minutes to draw attention to one particular shortfall of the government, and that is the government's lack of response to the findings of the Productivity Commission's report into nursing home subsidies. Despite receiving in January of this year the Productivity Commission's findings that the government's funding index in relation to nursing home subsidies is wrong, the government has failed to give any indication as to when it will respond. We find that unacceptable.</para><para>Here, yet again, we have an example of a government setting up its own objective independent body to look into what is to be done in the area of aged care, only to ignore its findings. The whole point of this inquiry 
 was to determine whether the proposed coalescence of nursing home subsidies should proceed or be replaced by another funding methodology. The Productivity Commission did not endorse the government's coalescence proposal. Despite this, in setting nursing home subsidy rates from 1 July this year, the government went ahead with its proposal anyway.</para><para>The Democrats call on the government to end the current angst in the aged care sector in relation to this matter today by making it very clear exactly when and how the findings of this report will be responded to. It is worth noting that the findings and recommendations of this Productivity Commission inquiry have wide industry support. The Democrats will continue to work with all of those involved in the aged care sectorâboth providers and those who represent the consumers of aged careâto achieve an improved level of care for the residents of aged care facilities. As the measures contained in this bill today are supported by all of those involved in the industry, we are happy to support them today too.</para><para>The ALP have a series of amendments to this legislation. While the Democrats have some sympathy with the sentiment which obviously lies behind some of those changes, we will not be able to support them, because neither we nor the industry saw them until just a short time ago. As a result, there has been inadequate time for meaningful consultation. Indeed, those whom I have spoken with in the industry have said that they have not had a chance to look at them or consider them in any depth. In fact, they urged us to reject the amendments and not delay the bill.</para><para>We will be seeking clarification from the government on some of the issues raised by the ALP's amendments. However, I say to the opposition that they do themselves absolutely no favours when they hand complicated amendments to usâand to the industryâat the last minute. It leaves the Democrats with no choice but to vote against them, because it would be completely irresponsible for us to support changes which may bring with them negative unintended consequences which nobody has had time to consider.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>8718</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="r842">Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999</inline> . I wonder if the government have heard of the International Federation of Ageing and their Declaration on the Rights and Responsibilities of Older Persons. As Ageing International reveals on, page 15 of their fall edition, these include:</para></talk.start><para>12. To obtain health care in order to maintain or regain the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well being and to prevent or delay the onset of illness.</para><para>13. To access social and legal services to enhance capacity for autonomy and provide protection and care.</para><para>14. To utilise appropriate levels of institutional care which provide protection, rehabilitation and social and mental stimulation in a humane and secure environment.</para><para>15. To exercise human rights and fundamental freedoms when residing in any shelter, care and treatment facility, including full respect for their dignity, beliefs, needs and privacy and for the right to make decisions about their care and quality of life.</para><para>One could rightly assume that the government are not listening to the voices of elderly Tasmanians or to the International Federation of Ageing, as a lack of funding in public health and legal aid means that preventable health and legal representation on civil matters are achievable only by the wealthy. Or are they punishing the elderly in Tasmania for the last election result? Nothing else could explain the callous indifference the government is showing to the elderly in need of residential care in my state.</para><para>This bill represents inertia on the government's behalf as, after 18 months of representations made, reports given and letters written, it seems that little is getting through. I know numerous letters have been written by Aged Care Tasmania Incorporated outlining the undue pressure any cuts in funding would mean to the Tasmanian aged care industry and, importantly, to those they serve so well.</para><para>Reducing the funding to the elderly that need care is not like targeting those on unemployment benefits or other easy targets that make up the daily feeding frenzy on talkback radio. They cannot be labelled as unworthy of 
 assistance or as somehow undeserving. Yet, apart from the minor cosmetic changes, this bill delivers little and, in the case of elderly Tasmanians, does nothing to address the problems raised over the last 1Â½ years.</para><para>This bill had a quasi launch on 5 March 1998, when it was tabled as the Aged Care Amendment Bill 1998. The Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 that is now being discussed is the old bill with a couple of crisis measures thrown inâand that is about it. What caused the crisis measures, the add-ons, to the original? Was it a result of well set out, planned policy objectivesâother than the reduction of $500 million from the sector in 1996-97? The crisis measures were directly related to the government's own `reforms'âa word they use, but I would notâin slash and burn policies that typify this government.</para><para>Remember when they wanted to take the family home and then quickly gave it back? Some people were badly hurt by that. This bill partly compensates them with ex gratia payments. It also seeks to stop those that had to pay for not being there. Confusing, yes, but as a direct result of these glorious reforms the elderly had to pay fees for a service they had not received. The complete stupidity of this oversight is a common occurrence in the government's policies. We get used to it, but the frail and elderly should never have to.</para><para>This policy also fixes another huge oversight in previous reforms. Currently the government is unable to act on a fraudulent provider without closing the service. These fraudulent providers are currently still operating as, due to the government's ineptness, shonky operators are still running some of the homes.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

</para><para>I would like to make some comments about the Airservices Australia corporate plan document dated July 1998 to June 2003. I and a number of others, both in this place and in the other place, have been critical of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, and before him Mr Vaile, for their failure to properly deal with a number of important transport matters. There is plenty of evidence to draw on to support that charge.</para><para>A report of the House of Representatives entitled <inline font-style="italic">Planning not patching</inline>, by the Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform Standing Committee, was tabled in November 1997. We are, as yet, to get a government response to that report. We have still not received a response from Mr Anderson to the <inline font-style="italic">Tracking Australia</inline> report from the same committee. It was tabled in August of last year. The <inline font-style="italic">Revitalisation rail</inline> report of the rail projects task force was released in April this year, but we have heard nothing yet from Mr Anderson. A key report from the shipping reform working group was completed in April of this year and provided to Mr Anderson. It still sits on his desk. The Hawke review on air safety responsibilities was completed in December of last yearâon timeâbut we have heard nothing.</para><para>We are now told that a final BASI report on the class G airspace trial will not be released until the end of the year. The draft was circulated to interested parties for comment ages ago. These are all very important reports that are of vital interest to key transport sectors in this country, but they have all been simply put to one side, just as the interests of rail, sea and air transport in this country have been put to one side by Mr Anderson.</para><para>While we on this side of the chamber are expected to argue publicly on behalf of these key sectors of the economy, it is not often that the chair of a public authority openly and stridently criticises his own minister. Things are clearly very bad when that happens. But that is what I discovered when I read the covering letter to the report we are now considering. Firstly, I draw the attention of the Senate to the date of that letter. It was dated 11 February 1999. One could be forgiven for thinking that this report has been 
 sitting somewhere on Minister Anderson's desk waiting for clearance for eight months. Perhaps he could not find it under the other reports.</para><para>In his letter that commences the report, Mr Forsyth says that the corporate plan was originally submitted in May last year. After all, the plan does cover the period commencing June 1998, and today's date is 22 September 1999. So it seems that Airservices clearly met its deadline. Mr Forsyth advised Mr Anderson that the original plan had to be withdrawn because it could not reflect the Department of Transport's structural review. That review was completed and provided to the former minister in March 1998. The department met its deadline with the Airservices review, and so I assume that that report just sat around in Mr Vaile's office and then Mr Anderson's office.</para><para>Despite so much time passing, because the report is now more than a year late, Mr Forsyth was forced to tell Mr Anderson that it was still incomplete. Mr Forsyth states:</para><para>As you are aware, Airservices is in a state of flux because of the government's indecision on some of the planned reforms.</para><para>I must say that that was an extraordinary statement for a chair to make in a report to his minister, a report that he knows will be tabled in parliament. It is a statement usually saved for the privacy of a ministerial office.</para><para>The fact that Mr Forsyth has reached such a level of frustration gives an insight into the level of frustration the rest of the transport sector in this country is feeling with this minister and this government. Later in the same letter Mr Forsyth tells the minister:</para><para>If the government does not deliver on these aspectsâ</para><para>and I interpose here that he is referring to the structural reformsâ</para><para>momentum will be lost and the reforms will fail. The financial consequences of such a failure will be significant.</para><para>It is clear that the desire of the Airservices chairman is for the organisation to be privatised.

The report, to a degree, speaks for itself. But some of the things that the previous speaker has mentioned were so outrageous as to require some comment. Of course, Mr Anderson is one of the most efficient ministers of a very large number of very efficient ministers in the government. The work that he does in all aspects of transport is enormous. It is a very complex portfolio and, of course, Mr Anderson has a range of matters to deal with, particularly now with his role as Deputy Prime Minister. But he can be well proud of the work that he has done in the transport area.</para></talk.start><para>Rail reform has gone ahead in leaps and bounds since this government took over. The previous government, the Labor Party government, spoke for 13 years about the things they were intending to do, but of course they never got around to doing anything. Roads, under the Labor regime, went backwards; the disastrous state that many of the roads are in around Australia is the result of something that grew up in the 13 sad years that Labor was in power. In aviation, Mr Anderson has introduced a number of initiatives. He has had a number of very difficult problems to look at, not the least of which being the second Sydney airport, an issue that the Labor Party were never quite able to deal with in the 13 years that they were in government. They kept putting it off and putting it off. Senator O'Brien would well know about those things.</para><para>Mr Anderson has perhaps not received the credit he should have for the tremendous job that he did to help reduce transport costs to rural and regional Australia.

As a result of their opposition, Mr Anderson has had to spend an enormous amount of time getting a new package together which has, in the end, provided a tremendous outcome for the people of rural and regional Australia.

The previous Labor government developed a retirement incomes policy to address the problems arising from an ageing population, caused primarily by the baby boom generation moving into the age pension age over the next couple of decades. The superannuation guarantee was central to that policy and the 1992 superannuation guarantee charge legislation has seen all employers contribute the superannuation guarantee to registered superannuation funds on behalf of employees since that time.</para></talk.start><para>The charge commenced at three per cent of an employee's pay and has steadily risen to seven per cent today. Award superannuation has also played a significant part in employee savings and, together with the superannuation guarantee, cemented the need for supervision and regulation of the superannuation industry. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, sometimes referred to as the SI(S) Act, substantially increases the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry and represents a substantial strengthening of the security of superannuation savings and the protection of the rights of superannuation fund members.</para><para>Since 1 July 1998, APRAâthe Australian Prudential Regulation Authorityâis the Commonwealth agency which is now responsible for prudential regulation of banks, life 
 insurance companies, general insurance companies and superannuation funds, having taken over the functions from the previous Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, for insurance and superannuation, and from the Reserve Bank of Australia for banks. In the case of superannuation funds, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority aims to ensure that the trustees are aware of their obligations to members and manage the funds in their care prudently in the interests of members. A great responsibility is put on trustees.</para><para>I am going to outline tonight that in this particular case the trustees have not acted prudently. APRA does not guarantee the performance of financial institutions but has the power to require them to observe prudential standards and to intercede if it believes the interests of depositors, policy holders or members are at risk. They look at approved deeds and the performance of funds. I am afraid they slipped in this particular case.</para><para>Consumer issues, however, such as the information or advice provided about financial products or the resolution of consumer complaints about financial services or charges, are primarily the responsibility of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC. Where their responsibilities overlap, APRA cooperates particularly closely with ASIC.</para><para>When trustees of superannuation funds invest members' money there should be at least three major objectives. They are: to achieve above average investment performance with an acceptable level of risk; to gain results which compare more favourably than those available on deposit; and to increase the value of member's contributions by achieving a rate of interest, over the long term, exceeding the rate of inflation.</para><para>The investment strategy must therefore be based on these objectives. In choosing a range of asset classes, a trustee or trustees should have regard to the advice of professional investment advisers. To keep the fluctuations in any one market to a minimum, the asset classes, for example, could include a mix of cash on deposit, bonds, property and shares. Investing through a range of managers also 
 helps to reduce the risk of fluctuations even further.</para><para>You can imagine my absolute despair when I was made aware recently of problems with the EPAS Fundâthe Employees Productive Award Superannuation Fundâan industry fund used by employers in the accommodation industry. When we go to the 1998 annual return, it declared a negative return of 43 per cent. A statement dated 30 December 1998 was mailed to members stating that a negative crediting rate of 43 per cent had been applied to all their contributions, effectively cutting their earnings or their hard earned savings in half. Naturally, this raised concerns from members.</para><para>The fund owner, Mr Terry James, had been trustee and chairman until his resignation in October 1998. Investigations reveal that on 1 July 1996 APRA, concerned the fund was too heavily committed in property investment, directed the appointment of Mr Gerald Parker as trustee in order to diversify funds invested. It appears there were at least 20 interrelated companies with directors common to many companies. So the question really does have to be asked: why did APRA approve such an arrangement of 20 interrelated companies? This is just not good enough. This is not good oversight by APRA and it is not good oversight by the trustees in the discharge of their responsibilities to the members.</para><para>But worse, members' inquiries to EPAS Ltd are answered with the words, `This is commercially privileged information,' and very little useful information is forthcoming. On 29 July 1998 Gerald Parker notified members that EPAS Ltd now had four trustee directors, bringing diverse experience to the board. Too little too late. On the same day in a notice to all members issued by EPAS Ltd as trustee, the question was asked, `Why did the fund have so much invested in property?' The answer was:</para><para>The history of the EPAS Fund saw the Fund invest in loans. Mostly these loans were secured by mortgages over property. In a move to increase the performance of EPAS for its members, the present Trustee Directors, demanded that the loans be repaid.</para><para>A fair enough action. It continued:</para><para>Those borrowers who defaulted on their EPAS loans have been taken over and either sold or retained ready for prudent sale.</para><para>A major problem was the purchase and refurbishment of O'Hara's Resort Hotel in Launceston, Tasmania. It alone accounts for $7 million of members' moneys. On top of the substantial property asset losses, EPAS also reported a loss of $918,000 in share dealings in 1998. I remind honourable senators this was at a time of strong share growth.</para><para>Who is responsible for this total mismanagement of the members' funds? Clearly, I point the finger at the trustees, because trustees have greater liabilities than directors of corporate companies. They have their personal assets at stake. I think it is time that delinquent trustees are made an example of by the authorities. Why hasn't APRA taken action against these delinquent or former trustees to show the need for separate and prudent management of super funds? The blame rests principally on the trustees. I believe they are liable and they should be sued. The question on everybody's lips is: why hasn't APRA taken a more punitive action when clearly it has such powers and when clearly the former directors were so delinquent in the discharge of their responsibilities?</para><para>A central principle of the SIS legislation is that trustees are primarily responsible for the viability and prudent operation of superannuation funds. The SI'S legislation imposes fiduciary duties on trustees to act in the best interest of the members. The EPAS Fund, with 12,000 members, should never have been directly investing in property assets and resorts and had such arrangements with 20 other operations with common directors.</para><para>The 1998 accounts show an amount of $4,254 directed to `trustees indemnity insurance'. So the trustees have some sort of money they can call upon if they are sued. Why haven't they been sued? Where is APRA in relation to this particular amount? It is doubtful of course that any insurance claim could completely recoup all the money these members have lost, but at least they should be trying.  </para><para>With award superannuation and superannuation guarantee, many people do not think about the amount of money their employers contribute on their behalf to a superannuation fund. If they do, rarely do they wonder if the money is safe. It is up to this Senate and the regulating authorities to ensure that the money is safe. The disaster is horrifying for every member who stands to lose money. Both APRA and ASIC, with the APRA appointed trustee, are working together to review an untenable situation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Local Government: New South Wales Elections</title><page.no>8723</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>8723</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise this evening to comment on the recent local government elections in New South Wales. Whilst I am delighted to be able to report to this chamber that Labor enjoyed electoral success right across New South Wales, I also wish to turn my attention to some of the unscrupulous tactics employed throughout this campaign by various players within the New South Wales division of the Liberal Partyâthose geniuses whom I have had occasion to disparage in this place on a number of earlier occasions.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst there have been some very highly publicised examples of the New South Wales Liberal Party's underhanded approach in these electionsâsuch as the sordid Frank Sartor affairâI wish to concentrate on a few less publicised but equally grubby strategies that were employed in the recent round of local government elections. In particular, I wish to bring to the attention of this chamber a number of duplicitous and deceitful tactics employed in the Penrith City local government elections. I specifically want to raise some questions about the apparent role of the office of the member for Lindsay, the Hon. Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, in the running of this very grubby and cynical election campaign.</para><para>This election was characterised by a particularly high number of micro parties standing for election. This was particularly the case in the city's East Ward, where I happen to live. For reasons that will become a little clearer in a few moments, it is worth pointing out that the Liberal Party's No. 1 candidate 
 was a Mr Steve Simat. It is also worth noting that Mr Simat is currently employed on the member for Lindsay's staff, a point that Mr Simat was at pains to make at every opportunity during the election campaign. It is also significant to note that Mr Simat's running mate at No. 2 on the Liberal ticket was Ms Christine Bourne, also a staff member in the office of the member for Lindsay. But I shall return to Ms Bourne a little later.</para><para>At the close of nominations, it appeared there seemed to be a number of unusual links between the Liberal Party and those various single-issue micro parties. In the East Ward of the Penrith City Council elections, the ward in which Mr Simat and Ms Bourne were both running, three candidates all listed 15 Avon Place, St Clair, as their home address on their respective nomination forms.</para><para>Two of these candidates, Mr Paul Matosin and Mr Joe Matosin, were representing the Marijuana Smokers Rights Party. This on its own may not seem all that peculiar. However, it must be pointed out that a Mr Adam Brown, also contesting the election, had listed 15 Avon Place, St Clair, as his address on his application form. Interestingly, Mr Adam Brown was the leading candidate for the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party.</para><para>All these candidates appear to be guilty of committing electoral fraud, and both these partiesâthe Marijuana Smokers Rights Party and the No Badgerys Creek Airport Partyâappear to be Liberal Party `front parties'. Even though both these single issue parties seem to reflect views that are in direct opposition to the Liberal Party's platform, I will demonstrate that a connection does exist. Let me deal with the issue of electoral fraud first.</para><para>A brief visit to 15 Avon Place, St Clair, in the week following the lodgement of nomination forms showed no signs that the house was occupied. An absence of furniture seemed to indicate that no-one was currently living at the address. More interestingly, none of these three candidates were listed at 15 Avon Place, St Clair, on the previous month's electoral roll update. However, all three became enrolled at this address in the month immediately prior to the close of nominations. In the previous month, the Matosins were both listed 
 as enrolled at 20 Herley Avenue, Rossmore. Rossmore is not in the Penrith City Council area.</para><para>It is instructive to consider who owns the property at 15 Avon Place, St Clair. A land titles search revealed that the property was co-owned by Ms Liliana Djuka and Mr Stan Celar. Mr Stan Celar appears to be the same Stan Celar that was running in the No. 2 position on the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party's East Ward ticket. The other co-owner of the Avon Place residence, Liliana Djuka, was the No. 4 candidate on the Liberal Party's ticket in East Ward. Not only was she a Liberal Party candidate but she also shares the same electoral enrolment address as Mr Steve Simat, the No. 1 Liberal candidate in East Ward. It has also been reported in the local papers that, when asked for the reasons why he ran in the election, Mr Stan Celar replied, `Because Steve Simat asked me to.'</para><para>There was, however, even more to the Liberal Party connection, with what clearly appears to have been a series of front parties designed to funnel preferences back to the Liberals. Both Mr Joe Matosin and Mr Paul Matosin from the Marijuana Smokers Rights Party appear on a print-out dated 11 August 1999 of the Rossmore branch of the Young Liberals, of which Mr Steve Simat was previously a member. Both Matosins are listed as living at 20 Herley Avenue, the Rossmore address at which they were enrolled up to the previous month and which, as I have said previously, is outside the Penrith City Council boundaries.</para><para>It leaves unanswered the question as to whether Adam Brown from the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party is in fact the same Adam Brown that has previously worked on the election campaigns for the member for Lindsay and is currently a member of the Willoughby Young Liberals. It is also interesting to make the point that both Steve Simat and Adam Brown are part of the same right wing faction within the Young Liberals, even though in different branches. It is also important to note that Steve Simat was elected to the council on the preferences of the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party.</para><para>Further strengthening the suggestion that the Liberal Party has taken control of, or perhaps even established, the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party, is the fact that Mr Al Mewett, the No. 2 Liberal candidate in Penrith's East Ward, ran as the No Badgerys Creek Airport candidate at the last state election for the seat of Mulgoa only six months ago. It is also worth noting that the registered officer of the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party is Mr John Barker, who, strangely enough, ran as a candidate for the Wilderness Party in the Blue Mountains council election. John Barker's brother, David Barker, however, was the No Badgerys Creek Airport Party candidate in the Blue Mountains and was previously the Liberal candidate in the state seat of Liverpool only six months ago.</para><para>A further coincidence was that Mr John Barker's Wilderness Party was also contesting the Penrith City Council elections. When doorknocked, the lead candidate for the Wilderness Party, Ms Ana Grguric, in Penrith's East Ward, was in Perth. Ana was not to be seen during the campaign, but her brother John was, as he was a booth captain for the Liberal Party handing out how-to-votes on election day.</para><para>Other dubious parties contending the East Ward election were the Seniors Party and the Gun Owners and Sporting Shooters/Hunters Rights Party. It is interesting to see that both the Marijuana Smokers Rights Party and the Seniors Party contested elections in two council areasâPenrith and Leichhardt. On the face of it, there does not seem to be any connection. However, it is worth noting that Ms Christine Bourne, a staffer working for the member for Lindsay, was previously a Leichhardt councillor after the 1995 election. Although Ms Bourne was unseated as a result of a dispute over the counting of the ballot which ultimately went to the High Court, I understand that Ms Bourne has recently been served with a notice of bankruptcy.</para><para>In all of this, it might seem reasonable to say that none of this could have happened without the member for Lindsay's knowledge. This seems unlikely, given the member for Lindsay's keen interest and active involvement in the campaign. After becoming the 
 president of the local government conference, the member for Lindsay used her influence to roll the incumbent councillor, and a good councillor, Robin Wiles, in favour of her two staff members. In a letter sent out to the Liberal Party members on her parliamentary letterhead, the member for Lindsay wrote to branch members illustrating the importance of the elections, indicating that the campaign would become the focus of her activities over the four-week campaign period.</para><para>The most disturbing aspect of all of this is the opportunistic use of the highly emotive issue of the Badgerys Creek airport. The member for Lindsay, who says one thing in Canberra and another thing in Penrith, along with her staff, have sought to engineer a situation where they were to benefit from the community anger and resentment caused by an airport that her government remains committed to building. It is a shame, and it has damaged her credibility on the issue and her credibility as an honest broker who is committed to achieving the best for the people of her electorate. Sadly, this is not the end of it.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Local Government: New South Wales Elections</title><title>Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment</title><page.no>8725</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>8725</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI had intended to speak about something else and I do hope that I get to the topic I wanted to speak about tonight. But before I do, I just wanted to say that it is very disappointing when a senator makes an intemperate attack in this house on another member of parliamentâit is expressly provided in the rules that it is inappropriate to do soâparticularly an attack on our colleague the honourable member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, who is a minister in the government, and two members of her staff, Steve Simat and Christine Bourne, and a number of other individuals who were apparently candidates at the recent local council elections in New South Wales.</para></talk.start><para>A number of very unfortunate imputations bearing on the credibility and integrity of another member of parliament have been made and in fact, by inference, criminal 
 allegations have been suggested, namely, electoral fraud. I am not entirely sureâI will have to read what Senator Hutchins saidâwhether he is actually accusing the minister of electoral fraud or whether he is suggesting that she aided and abetted it through knowledge. I am not entirely sure exactly how he put it, but he makes a most serious allegation that will require to be dealt with in one way or another.</para><para>I am not entirely sure that it is not a breach of privilege in this place to have made the allegations in the way he has, to reflect on the character and intentions of another member. In any event, what Senator Hutchins did seem to be suggesting, on the flimsiest of evidence and on a mishmash of conclusions based upon creeping around and looking through open windows of houses to see whether there are signs of occupation, which is a pretty demeaning activity in the first place, proves really absolutely nothing and is a very unfortunate smear tactic that is entirely unworthy of Senator Hutchins. As I said, it may in fact be a misuse of privilege and it is a matter that ought to be looked at.</para><para>What I did want to say tonight was that election to this place does provide one with excellent opportunities to become involved in issues and organisations that are of great importance and significance in the wider community. The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment is such an organisation that I have become involved with, being appointed as a director as the nominee of the Prime Minister. I want to make a few comments about this fine organisation.</para><para>The Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment was actually founded as long ago as 1985 by the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It is a business oriented employer organisation focusing on the elimination of discrimination and harassment, creating workplaces where differences are respected and valued and developing effective business oriented affirmative action strategies. The council provides information, skill development, training and comprehensive consulting and advisory services to member 
 organisations and other clients in both the public and private sectors.</para><para>In my capacity as a member of the board, it was my pleasure last Wednesday to attend the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>/Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1999 Corporate Work and Family Awards luncheon. The awards were developed in 1992 in conjunction with the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment to recognise organisations that have actually taken the initiative in providing a family friendly work environment for their employees. This year the awards were also cosponsored by the Work and Family Unit of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.</para><para>The Corporate Work and Family Awards recognise certain organisations and small businesses that have made their workplaces more family friendly. As Peter Reith stated in the address he delivered at the awards, `High turnover isn't good for businesses, and family friendly practices such as offering control over working hours in some form or other to low skilled employees is one sure way of helping to keep turnover levels low.'</para><para>Changes to industrial relations laws in 1996 have delivered employers the tools and the flexibility to actually  make these sorts of changes. As Mr Reith stated, there is significant evidence that throughout the agreement making process available under the federal Workplace Relations Act 1996 plenty of workplaces are adopting family friendly practices. For example, a recent study by the Work and Family Unit showed that 67 per cent of certified agreements contained at least one family friendly provision, and that figure rises to 79 per cent for Australian workplace agreements.</para><para>A recent departmental report titled <inline font-style="italic">Work and family state of play</inline> reiterates the need for such family friendly provisions in legislation when it found that flexible working arrangements are significant in allowing employees job satisfaction to balance their work and family responsibilities and to have lower levels of stress. However, as the minister stressed, `There is still cultural change that needs to happen at many workplaces . . . 
 employers and employees need to think more creatively about how to give all types of employees more control over working hours.'</para><para>Those organisations that received awards this year showed great initiative and forethought in establishing a work environment where the family unit was respected. Lawyers Blake Dawson and Waldron showed that flexible working hours are becoming the norm, while at Innovative People Solutions 30 per cent of its Sydney premises are devoted to a creche and employees have the option of an extra two weeks recreation leave a year to spend time with their families.</para><para>The awards gold medal winner, Mobil, has also effected massive organisational change. A culture of mistrust and excessive working hours has been altered to one of flexible work options where a family friendly culture is now embedded in the company. Restructuring of wage packages have seen decreases in overtime, yet increases in pay; and industrial action has decreased significantly. Writing about this in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, Stephen Long said:</para><para>Initiatives like these show that employers don't necessarily have to spend lots of money to promote work and family balance. Big improvements can come from simple things that many take for granted, such as giving people flexibility to alter start and finish times, or to take time off to attend a family or personal issue and make up time later.</para><para>These award winners, and the recognition of the changes they have made, show the dramatic nature of workplace changes that have occurred for women in the past decade and, in particular, since the government introduced its workplace relations legislation. Australia's award system was far too restrictive and rigid to provide the necessary conditions for flexible workplace practices. It is fair to say the Labor government missed out on the opportunity to introduce flexible working conditions with the introduction of the Industrial Relations Reform Act in 1993. As Mr Reith confirmed during his address, workplaces dominated by awards are not as likely to have family friendly practices. However, as is shown by the winners of these awards, flexible work sees benefits such as reduced absenteeism, decreased turnover, increased productivity and increases in morale.</para><para>Recent ABS figures have also shown the great benefits that inure to women from these changes. Women are enjoying a period of lower unemployment and higher employment opportunities. Choice in determining the level of labour force participation has become very important for women. Measures such as the soon to be implemented $24 million Return to Work program and the new tax system, which contains income tax cuts and increased child-care assistance, will assist women who choose paid work to make the most of their opportunities.</para><para>As the only non-profit business sponsored organisation working nationally in these areas, the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment is uniquely placed to assist employers in meeting legal guidelines and identifying the likelihood that they might be predisposed to a claim. I take this opportunity to commend the winners of these awards as well as the council and to encourage other organisations across the country to bear in mind the value that a flexible, family friendly work environment can have for both them and their employees.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Forest Agreement: South-East Queensland</title><page.no>8727</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>8727</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Qld</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis nation has an interest in achieving the efficient and effective management of the nation's forest resources. To this end, Queensland has finalised a regional forest agreement for south-east Queensland. I will provide some background on this. An RFA, a regional forest agreement, is an agreement about the long-term management and use of forests in a particular region between the Commonwealth and a state government. Its aim is to provide certainty, reduce duplication and provide a single plan for government decision making. The end result is to provide a durable agreement on the management and use of forests. The regional forest agreements are intended to provide the basis for both future forest management and an internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable forest products industry.</para></talk.start><para>Queensland has now completed an exhaustive process of consultation to come up with a regional forest agreement. I would like to 
 congratulate the Queensland Labor Premier, Mr Peter Beattie, and the Deputy Premier, Mr Jim Elder, for the leadership shown throughout the process of negotiating the South-East Queensland Regional Forest Agreement. Negotiating an agreeable outcome between different interest groups is certainly not an easy task. It is a testament to the Queensland Labor government that this outcome has been achieved. The state government, the timber industry and the conservationists have all signed off on a historic agreement which provides a blueprint for the future management of our forests and the basis for an internationally competitive and environmentally sustainable forest industry.</para><para>The central elements of the plan are as follows. At least 350 extra jobs and an increase of 425,000 hectares in the amount of native forest protected from loggingâand this doubles the size of the existing conservation reserve. By the year 2025, more than one million hectares will not be available for logging. The plan also includes additional funding to manage the increased conservation reserve, 25 years guaranteed resource supply at current levels for all existing mills except for three mills, a $10 million incentive package to encourage new investment into the value adding side of the hardwood sector, 10 million new trees to be planted over the next five years as part of an $18 million softwood and hardwood plantation program and an end to all logging in native forests by the year 2025. These elements will ensure a sensible balance between conservation and the preservation of rural communities.</para><para>The Queensland government's plan for the South-East Queensland Regional Forest Agreement had the objectives of providing a comprehensive, adequate and representative environmental reserve system, ensuring the management of forests is on the basis of ecologically sustainable management, and facilitating the development of a competitive and efficient timber industry. The Queensland Labor government has succeeded in ensuring that these objectives were met and, most importantly, that there would be no net loss of jobs.</para><para>I have been on record a number of times defending the rights of timber workers to keep their jobs, and I would certainly not be supporting this agreement if it impacted adversely on employment within the timber industry. I had the opportunity of marching in Queensland with the timber industry in support of jobs. I had the opportunity of going to regional Queensland and speaking to various councils about the impact on the industry if the timber industry were to be wound down. However, this agreement not only ensures the security of current employees but will have a positive impact on employment, with over 400 new jobs proposed in a number of areas throughout the industry.</para><para>The Queensland Premier's promise of no net job losses is also a vindication of the Australian Workers Union's vigorous campaign to protect its members. Both the union and the industry have consistently maintained that the timber industry is capable of long-term sustainability, and this arrangement agrees with that assertion. The union's efforts have ensured the security of over 500 jobs and the creation of many more. Unlike the mess that has unfolded in Western Australia, the Queensland Labor government has used commonsense to ensure that all parties to the agreement have been listened to.</para><para>I call on the Howard government to abandon its confrontational approach to regional forest agreements and support the state Labor government's recommended agreement. Given that the relevant stakeholders in Queensland have overwhelmingly endorsed this agreement, the community rightly expects the government to come through with the money needed to ensure a successful outcome. I would urge this government to focus on the outcome rather than the technicalities of the issue.

Short-term risk minimisation arrangements were not introduced for other aquatic products but import risk analyses were initiated with high priority.</para><para>As an interim measure, AQIS prohibited the importation of uncooked prawns, and prawn based products containing uncooked prawns, for purposes other than human consumption with effect from 11 November 1996. This restriction applies to all prawn species including marine, brackish and freshwater. A risk analysis on the importation of green prawns commenced in May 1997. A technical issues paper was released in November 1998. The draft report of the risk analysis will be released in November 1999.</para><para>Restrictions on freshwater crayfish also took effect on 11 November 1996. Importers of uncooked freshwater crayfish must obtain an import permit from AQIS prior to presenting product for quarantine entry. No permits have been granted since 1996.

 commenced in September 1996 and a technical issues paper was released in May 1999.

The import risk analysis on ornamental fish was finalised on 19 July 1999, when AQIS announced its decision to strengthen quarantine controls.

The import risk analysis on non-viable marine finfish (including fresh frozen aquatic animal feeds and baits and whole fish for human consumption) was finalised on 19 July 1999, when AQIS announced its decision to introduce requirements that imported marine finfish products (eg herring, cod, halibut, hake, bass, and sea bream) be `head off', eviscerated (gutted) and processed in approved plants or treated in a way that provides an equivalent level of protection. </para><para>.
